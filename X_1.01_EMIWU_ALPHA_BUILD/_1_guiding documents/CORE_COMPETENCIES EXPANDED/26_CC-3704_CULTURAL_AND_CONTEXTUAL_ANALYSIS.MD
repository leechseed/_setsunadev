  - This analysis framework enables comparisons between narratives from different cultures, time periods, or ideological backgrounds. Such comparative studies highlight universal storytelling elements and unique cultural expressions, enriching the field of narratology.

- **Supporting Interdisciplinary Research**:

  - Cultural and contextual analysis bridges narratology with other disciplines such as anthropology, history, and cultural studies. This interdisciplinary approach broadens the scope of narrative analysis, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of stories and their impacts.
