### 1. Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Narrative Levels Framework**

**Narrative Levels**:
**Definition**: Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan explores the concept of narrative levels, which refer to the different layers or planes of narration within a story. This framework includes the distinction between extradiegetic and intradiegetic levels, as well as the phenomenon of metalepsis, which complicates the relationship between these levels.

---

### 2. Key Concepts

#### 2.1. Extradiegetic Level

**Definition**:
The extradiegetic level refers to narration that occurs outside the story world. This is typically the primary level of narration, where the narrator is not a character within the narrative but exists externally to tell the story.

    **Extradiegetic Level**
```

##### 2.1.1. **Components of Extradiegetic Level**

###### 2.1.1.1. **Narrative Authority**

- **Definition**: The extradiegetic narrator holds authority, controlling the flow of information and influencing the reader’s understanding of the story.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A[**Narrative Authority**] --> B[**Omniscient Control**];
    A --> C[**Information Management**];
    A --> D[**Objective Perspective**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Omniscient Control**: Provides comprehensive insights, often knowing more than any character in the story.
  - **Information Management**: Decides what details to reveal or withhold, guiding reader perception.
  - **Objective Perspective**: Often maintains a neutral, authoritative tone that influences how the reader interprets the narrative.

###### 2.1.1.2. **Framing Device**

- **Definition**: The extradiegetic level often serves as a framing device, introducing the intradiegetic narrative and setting its context.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    E[**Framing Device**] --> F[**Contextual Setup**];
    E --> G[**Narrative Transition**];
    E --> H[**Perspective Control**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Contextual Setup**: Establishes the setting and background for the main story.
  - **Narrative Transition**: Provides a bridge between different narrative levels, enhancing structure.
  - **Perspective Control**: Offers a broader view that frames the main story within a larger narrative.

###### 2.1.1.3. **Narrative Distance**

- **Definition**: The extradiegetic narrator typically maintains a certain distance from the events of the story, providing an overarching perspective.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    I[**Narrative Distance**] --> J[**Detached Viewpoint**];
    I --> K[**Comprehensive Overview**];
    I --> L[**Analytical Tone**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Detached Viewpoint**: Observes the story from outside, offering an unbiased account.
  - **Comprehensive Overview**: Presents a complete view of the story, beyond the characters’ subjective experiences.
  - **Analytical Tone**: Often allows for reflective or interpretative commentary on the story’s events.

#### 2.2. Intradiegetic Level

```mermaid

  root((**Rimmon-Kenan`s Narrative Levels Framework**))
    **Intradiegetic Level**
```

**Definition**:
The intradiegetic level refers to narration that occurs within the story world, often involving characters who narrate stories inside the main narrative. These embedded narratives add layers to the storytelling.

##### 2.2.1. **Components of Intradiegetic Level**

###### 2.2.1.1. **Embedded Narratives**

- **Definition**: These are stories told by characters within the story, contributing backstory or parallel plotlines.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A[**Embedded Narratives**] --> B[**Story Within a Story**];
    A --> C[**Expanded World-Building**];
    A --> D[**Reflective Elements**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Story Within a Story**: Adds layers by having characters narrate sub-stories.
  - **Expanded World-Building**: Deepens the main narrative by introducing subplots or histories.
  - **Reflective Elements**: May echo or contrast the main plot, adding thematic richness.

###### 2.2.1.2. **Character Perspective**

- **Definition**: The intradiegetic narrator, being a character within the narrative, often provides a subjective or biased account of events. **Characteristics** **Personal Bias**: Narration reflects the character’s beliefs, motivations, and limitations. **Limited Knowledge**: The character only recounts events they are aware of, influencing reliability. **Emotional Insight**: Provides an intimate view of the character’s internal world and emotions.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    E[**Character Perspective**] --> F[**Personal Bias**];
    E --> G[**Limited Knowledge**];
    E --> H[**Emotional Insight**];
```

###### 2.2.1.3. **Narrative Depth**

- **Definition**: A narrative technique that adds layers to the story, providing greater richness and complexity through subplots, backstories, or internal reflections.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    I[**Narrative Depth**] --> J[**Multi-Layered Plot**];
    I --> K[**Backstory Integration**];
    I --> L[**Symbolic Resonance**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Multi-Layered Plot**: Includes subplots and embedded narratives that enhance the primary storyline.
  - **Backstory Integration**: Reveals character histories and motives gradually, adding depth to their present actions.
  - **Symbolic Resonance**: Uses symbolic elements within the narrative to provide deeper thematic meanings.

###### 2.2.1.4. **Multiplicity**

- **Definition**: The presence of various perspectives, voices, or storylines that coexist within the narrative, allowing for a more dynamic and multifaceted reading experience.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    M[**Multiplicity**] --> N[**Diverse Perspectives**];
    M --> O[**Concurrent Storylines**];
    M --> P[**Polyphonic Dialogue**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Diverse Perspectives**: Integrates multiple characters' viewpoints, offering contrasting or complementary insights.
  - **Concurrent Storylines**: Presents parallel or intersecting storylines, each contributing to the overall narrative.
  - **Polyphonic Dialogue**: Uses a range of voices to create a tapestry of opinions, beliefs, and ideas within the story.

#### 2.3. Metalepsis

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((**Rimmon-Kenan`s Narrative Levels Framework**))
    **Metalepsis**
```

**Definition**:
Metalepsis occurs when the boundaries between different narrative levels are transgressed, such as when a character interacts with the narrator or steps outside their narrative world.

##### 2.3.1. **Components of Metalepsis**

###### 2.3.1.1. **Boundary Transgression**

- **Definition**: This involves breaking the narrative "fourth wall" by crossing between narrative levels.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A[**Boundary Transgression**] --> B[**Narrative Disruption**];
    A --> C[**Reader Awareness**];
    A --> D[**Innovative Technique**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Narrative Disruption**: Blurs the line between different narrative layers, creating surprise or intrigue.
  - **Reader Awareness**: Makes readers conscious of the narrative as a constructed work.
  - **Innovative Technique**: Often used for experimental storytelling or postmodern effects.

###### 2.3.1.2. **Narrative Playfulness**

- **Definition**: Metalepsis introduces a playful or experimental quality to the narrative, making the reader aware of its constructed nature.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    E[**Narrative Playfulness**] --> F[**Self-Referential Elements**];
    E --> G[**Creative Freedom**];
    E --> H[**Reader Engagement**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Self-Referential Elements**: Highlights the fictionality of the narrative through breaking conventions.
  - **Creative Freedom**: Encourages an unconventional approach to storytelling.
  - **Reader Engagement**: Invites readers to question the nature of the story and its boundaries.

###### 2.3.1.3. **Thematic Implications**

- **Definition**: Metalepsis often explores themes like reality vs. fiction, the power of storytelling, and narrative limits.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    I[**Thematic Implications**] --> J[**Reality Examination**];
    I --> K[**Storytelling Power**];
    I --> L[**Philosophical Inquiry**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Reality Examination**: Challenges the reader’s understanding of what is real within the story.
  - **Storytelling Power**: Highlights the control the narrator or author has over the story world.
  - **Philosophical Inquiry**: Raises questions about narrative construction and perception.

##### 2.3.2. Implications of **Narrative Levels**

**Key Insight or Implication**:
Rimmon-Kenan’s framework highlights the complexity of narrative structures by analyzing how different levels of narration interact. This offers a deeper understanding of how stories are constructed and deconstructed, providing insight into the relationship between the reader, narrator, and narrative.

**Collaborative or Future-Oriented Insight**:
The exploration of narrative levels continues to influence the analysis of postmodern and experimental literature, where the boundaries between narrative layers are often blurred. Rimmon-Kenan’s model remains relevant for analyzing narratives that play with traditional structures.
