# Narratology

**Narratology** is the systematic study of narratives and narrative structures. It examines how stories are constructed, how they function, and how they convey meaning. Narratology explores the elements that make up narratives and the ways in which these elements interact to create cohesive and impactful stories.

## **SD002 Story vs. Discourse (Fabula vs. Sjuzhet)**

- **Story (Fabula)**: The raw chronological sequence of events in a narrative.
- **Discourse (Sjuzhet)**: The way these events are presented or structured in the narrative.

This competency involves differentiating between the actual events and their representation.

---

### **Key Concepts**

---

#### **Story (Fabula)**

- **Definition**:
  - In narratology, _fabula_ refers to the chronological sequence of events as they would occur in reality, independent of how they are presented in the narrative. It encompasses all the actions, events, and experiences that make up the narrative's content.
