###### 2.1.1.3. **Resolution**
  - **Definition**: The process by which binary oppositions in a narrative are resolved, often leading to a definitive conclusion (e.g., good triumphs over evil).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    I[**Resolution**] --> J[**Conclusive Outcome**]
    I --> K[**Thematic Fulfillment**]
    I --> L[**Character Development**]
```

  - **Characteristics**
    - **Conclusive Outcome**: Provides a clear end to the conflict, offering closure for the narrative and its characters.
    - **Thematic Fulfillment**: Reinforces the narrative’s central message by resolving the opposition in a way that aligns with the story’s moral or philosophical stance.
    - **Character Development**: Allows for significant growth or change in characters as they navigate and ultimately resolve the opposing forces.


###### 2.1.1.4. **Maintenance**
  - **Definition**: The narrative choice to sustain the tension between binary oppositions without definitive resolution, portraying an ongoing struggle (e.g., the continuous battle between life and death).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    M[**Maintenance**] --> N[**Persistent Tension**]
    M --> O[**Dynamic Balance**]
    M --> P[**Open-Ended Interpretation**]
```

  - **Characteristics**
    - **Persistent Tension**: Keeps the conflict alive, adding complexity and realism to the narrative by reflecting life’s unresolved struggles.
    - **Dynamic Balance**: Illustrates the coexistence of opposing forces, showing how characters or themes are influenced by their interactions.
    - **Open-Ended Interpretation**: Encourages readers to ponder the implications of an unresolved conflict, fostering deeper engagement and varied interpretations.
