### 1. **Title: Greimas's Actantial Model**

**Actantial Model**:
   **Definition**: Algirdas Julien Greimas’s *Actantial Model* is a structuralist framework for analyzing the roles and functions of characters in a narrative. The model identifies six essential actants—Subject, Object, Sender, Receiver, Helper, and Opponent—that interact to form the core of the narrative. These actants can represent characters, abstract concepts, or collective entities, making the model versatile for analyzing diverse narrative structures across various media.

### 3. Implications of **Actantial Model**

**Impact on Structuralist Narratology**:
   Greimas’s Actantial Model has significantly influenced structuralist narratology by providing a systematic way to analyze the functions and roles of characters in narratives. It emphasizes the underlying structure of stories and highlights the relationships between different narrative elements.

**Application Across Media**:
   The actantial model applies to various forms of media, including literature, film, theater, and video games. Its ability to represent characters and abstract entities as actants makes it adaptable for diverse narratives.

**Supporting Information**:
   - **Interdisciplinary Influence**: The model has influenced fields such as semiotics and communication studies by offering a universal framework for understanding how stories operate in different cultural contexts.
   - **Critiques**: Some argue that the model oversimplifies characters by reducing them to functional roles, but it remains a foundational tool for analyzing narrative structures.
