### 3. **Theoretical Significance**:
   - **Impact on Narrative Theory**: Herman’s Temporal Logic in Narrative Framework has significantly influenced narrative theory, particularly in understanding how the manipulation of time shapes the structure and meaning of a story. By integrating cognitive perspectives, Herman’s framework offers a comprehensive approach to analyzing narrative time, highlighting the interplay between narrative techniques and the reader’s mental processes. His work provides valuable tools for exploring how narratives create complex temporal structures that engage readers and convey deeper thematic content.
   - **Application Across Media**: Herman’s concepts are applicable across various narrative forms, including literature, film, theater, and interactive media such as video games. The manipulation of time is a fundamental aspect of storytelling in these media, and Herman’s framework offers insights into how these temporal structures influence the audience’s engagement and interpretation across different formats.
    - **Supporting Information**:
      - **Interdisciplinary Influence**: Herman’s exploration of temporal logic in narrative has influenced not only literary and narrative theory but also fields such as cognitive science and psychology, where the understanding of how humans perceive and process time is of significant interest. His work bridges the gap between narrative studies and cognitive approaches, offering a richer understanding of how time functions in storytelling.
      - **Critiques and Further Development**: While Herman’s framework is highly influential, some critics argue that it may prioritize the technical aspects of temporal manipulation over other narrative elements, such as character development or emotional resonance. However, his work continues to be developed and integrated with other narrative theories, providing a holistic understanding of how time functions in storytelling and its impact on the reader’s experience.
