### 1. **Title: Chatman's Narrative Communication Model**

**Narrative Communication**:
   **Definition**: Seymour Chatman’s *Narrative Communication Model* provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the intricate relationships between the various agents involved in both the creation and reception of a narrative. This model identifies key participants in the narrative process, including the *real author*, *implied author*, *narrator*, *narratee*, *implied reader*, and *real reader*. Chatman’s model emphasizes that narrative communication is a complex, layered process in which each agent plays a distinct role in shaping the narrative and its interpretation.

### 2. **Key Concepts**

#### 2.1. **Real Author**

**Definition**:
   The *real author* is the actual, living person who creates the narrative, writing the text with their own intentions, beliefs, and experiences.

##### 2.1.1. **Components of Real Author**

###### 2.1.1.1. **Personal Identity**
- **Definition**: The real author exists outside the text, and their personal life may influence their work, but they are not directly accessible through the narrative.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[**Personal Identity**] --> B[External Influence]
    A --> C[Separate Existence]
    A --> D[Indirect Impact]
```

  - **Characteristics**
    - **External Influence**: The author’s experiences, beliefs, and background can shape the themes and content of their work.
    - **Separate Existence**: The real author is distinct from the narrative itself and cannot be fully understood through the text alone.
    - **Indirect Impact**: Personal identity may be inferred through recurring themes or stylistic choices that reflect the author’s worldview.

###### 2.1.1.2. **Intentionality**
- **Definition**: The real author’s personal goals, beliefs, and circumstances may shape the themes and content of the narrative.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    E[**Intentionality**] --> F[Theme Shaping]
    E --> G[Narrative Purpose]
    E --> H[Conscious Crafting]
```

  - **Characteristics**
    - **Theme Shaping**: The author’s intentions influence the message and moral direction of the story.
    - **Narrative Purpose**: The plot and character arcs are often designed to reflect the author’s personal objectives or beliefs.
    - **Conscious Crafting**: Indicates that certain elements in the narrative were intentionally included to convey specific ideas or provoke reactions.

###### 2.1.1.3. **Distinct from Implied Author**
- **Definition**: While the real author creates the narrative, the implied author represents the version of the author constructed by the reader.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    I[**Distinct from Implied Author**] --> J[Reader Construction]
    I --> K[Interpretive Role]
    I --> L[Literary Device]
```

  - **Characteristics**
    - **Reader Construction**: The implied author is formed based on the narrative’s voice, style, and tone, separate from the actual author.
    - **Interpretive Role**: Acts as a bridge between the text and reader, guiding how the story’s values are perceived.
    - **Literary Device**: Functions as a narrative element, representing an idealized version of the author embedded within the story.

---

#### 2.2. **Implied Author**

### 3. Implications of **Narrative Communication**

**Impact on Narrative Theory**:
   Chatman’s *Narrative Communication Model* has had a profound impact on narrative theory, providing a structured approach to understanding how narratives are constructed and received. By defining the roles of the real author, implied author, narrator, narratee, implied reader, and real reader, Chatman allows for a more precise analysis of how meaning is conveyed and interpreted in storytelling.

**Application Across Media**:
   Chatman’s concepts are applicable across various media, including film, theater, and digital narratives. In these formats, understanding the distinctions between authorial roles and reader/viewer responses enhances insight into how narratives are constructed and consumed.
