### 1. **Title: Booth's Implied Author Model**

**Implied Author**:
**Definition**: Wayne C. Booth’s concept of the _implied author_ refers to the narrative persona that emerges from the text, distinct from both the real author and the narrator. The implied author reflects the version of the author that the reader perceives through the narrative’s tone, style, and ethical stance, acting as a mediator between the author’s intentions and the reader’s interpretation.

### 3. Implications of Implied Author

**Impact on Narrative Theory**:
Booth’s Implied Author Model challenges traditional views of authorial intent by suggesting that meaning is shaped by how the narrative is constructed and interpreted, not solely by the real author’s intentions. This concept has significantly influenced narrative ethics and the analysis of how narratives communicate moral and ideological messages.

**Application Across Genres and Media**:
The concept applies to various media beyond literature. In film, for example, the implied author can be inferred from directorial choices, while in digital media, design elements guide the user’s perception of the narrative. Understanding the implied author is crucial in analyzing how stories communicate their ethical stance across different formats.

**Supporting Information**:

- **Interdisciplinary Influence**: The implied author concept is used in film studies to analyze directorial voice and in communication theory to explore how media creators shape narrative values. It also informs ethical discussions about how narratives influence social attitudes.
- **Critiques and Further Development**: Critics argue that the implied author is an abstract concept, which may lead to overinterpretation. Additionally, the subjectivity of the reader’s construction raises questions about variability in interpretation. Despite these critiques, the implied author remains a key concept in understanding the complex relationship between the narrative, the author, and the reader.
