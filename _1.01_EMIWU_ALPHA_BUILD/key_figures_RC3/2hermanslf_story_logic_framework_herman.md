  - **Chronological**: Events follow a logical temporal order, from cause to effect.
  - **Consistent**: Time shifts are clearly indicated and do not disrupt the narrative’s flow.
  - **Coherent**: Temporal relationships enhance the narrative’s clarity and maintain the audience’s immersion.

---

###### 2.1.1.6. **Spatial Coherence**

- **Definition**:
  Spatial coherence ensures that the narrative’s setting is logically consistent, allowing readers to visualize and understand the story’s spatial relationships. It involves clear descriptions of locations and the logical movement of characters within these spaces.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    U[**Spatial Coherence**]
    U --> V[**Defined**];
    U --> W[**Consistent**];
    U --> X[**Realistic**];
```

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Defined**: Settings are vividly described and consistently maintained.
  - **Consistent**: Movements and interactions within the space align with logical constraints.
  - **Realistic**: Spatial relationships between characters, objects, and locations make sense within the narrative framework.

---

---

#### 2.2. **Narrative Sense-Making**

- **Definition**:
  - Story logic is not only about the narrative's formal elements but also about how readers use cognitive strategies to make sense of these elements. This involves interpreting the story's coherence, anticipating outcomes, and filling in gaps.

```mermaid
