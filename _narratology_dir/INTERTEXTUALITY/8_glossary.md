| Term                        | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| addressivity (Bakhtin)      | Refers to the fact that any utterance is directed towards an addressee (listener, potential respondent).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| agency                      | Term used in literary theory and criticism to retain notions of human participation in the production of meaning without suggesting more absolute notions such as originality, genius or uniqueness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| anagram                     | ‘A transposition of the letters of a word, name, or phrase, whereby a new one is formed’ (OED); Samuel Butler’s Erewhon is an anagram for ‘nowhere’. Explored by Saussure in the context of classical poetry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| anastomosis                 | ‘Intercommunication between two vessels, channels, or distinct branches of any kind, by a connecting branch. Applied originally to the cross-communications between arteries and veins’ (OED; see Baron, 2020: 93). Following the lead of Richard Ellmann, Scarlett Baron traces the origins of the literary use of this term to James Joyce, particularly in the ‘Oxen of the Sun’ part of Ulysses, and argues that, for Joyce, it has to do with ‘an extreme degree of intertextuality with a marked thematic preoccupation with the connections between literary creation and natural evolution’ (ibid.: 93). |
| anxiety of choice (Allen)   | A term coined by Graham Allen (1994; 2007) to refer to the response to a seemingly or actually unmanageable quantity of books in the world. The anxiety of choice, as opposed to Harold Bloom’s anxiety of influence, might be expressed by despair at not having a long enough life to read all the books one would like or feels one ought to read.                                                                                                                            |
| architextuality (Genette)   | ‘The entire set of general or transcendent categories types of discourse, modes of enunciation, literary genres – from which emerges each singular text’ (Genette, 1997a: 1). If literature is conceived as a formally defined system filled with categories such as the realist novel, tragedy, and so on, then architextuality is the study of literature in terms of these formal categories.                                                                              |
| carnival (Bakhtin)          | For Bakhtin, ‘carnivalesque’ forces in society are connected to popular forms of literature and language which disrupt the dominant order and monologic view of society and language promoted by dominant power groups. ‘Carnivalization’ relates to his term, ‘dialogicism’, and is opposed to notions of single meaning and unquestionable authority.                                                                                                                         |
| cloneliness (O’Sullivan)    | Coined by Michael O’Sullivan in his Cloneliness: On the Reproduction of Loneliness (2019), cloneliness represents modern states of alienation amid the interrelatedness of the new social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| deconstruction              | A movement associated with poststructuralism, and with the work of Derrida in particular. Deconstruction can be said to be generally critical of ideas of stable and authoritative meaning. It attempts to demonstrate how a reliance on the unstable phenomenon of language unravels dominant ideas and structures from within.                                                                                                              |
| descriptive system (Riffaterre) | ‘The network of words, phrases and stereotyped sentences associated with one another in ... relation to a kernel word to which they are subordinate’ (Riffaterre, 1990b: 126–27). Centrally important words in texts suggest a series of associated words and concepts which the text then manipulates to create its specific overall meaning.                                                                                                  |
| diachrony                   | A diachronic study in linguistics is the study of language over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| dialectics (Hegel, Marx)    | Can refer to an argument where a final position is achieved via dialogue, or can simply refer to the main argument or tendency of a work or a body of work (see Cuddon, 1992: 238–39). Hegelian dialectics is the clash between ‘thesis’ and ‘antithesis’, resolved by their ‘synthesis’. Hegel sought to demonstrate that distinctions between, say, science and art or mind and body could be resolved by the emergence of a ‘higher truth’. Marx recast this onto the conflict between the owners of capital and the workers who produced that capital.      |
| dialogic (Bakhtin)          | Refers to the idea that all utterances respond to previous utterances and are always addressed to other potential speakers, rather than occurring independently or in isolation. Language always occurs in specific social situations between specific human agents. Words always contain a dialogic quality, embodying a dialogue between different meanings and applications. Bakhtin’s dialogism undermines any argument for final and unquestionable positions, since every position within language is a space of dialogic forces rather than monologic truth.               |
| différance (Derrida)        | Combines Fr. ‘to defer, postpone, delay’ and ‘to differ, to be different from’. The word itself illustrates Derrida’s point that writing does not copy or follow speech. The distinction between the two different meanings does not ‘correspond to any distinction in their spoken form’ (Cuddon, 1992: 246). It makes no difference if we write or speak the word différance, we cannot help but invoke notions of both difference and deferral. The word thus illustrates that language involves at one and the same time the differences between and the deferral of meanings.     |
| discourse                   | Term used in distinct contexts in different disciplines. In the study of narrative the term ‘narrative’ is used to refer to the recounting of events without attention being paid to the person doing the recounting, e.g. ‘The King is dead’. In contrast, ‘discourse’ directs attention to the speaker or writer and the situation from which they speak or write, e.g. ‘He told them the sad news that the King was dead’. ‘Discourse’ has gained a more general sense of language in its social and ideological contexts. Culture and society can be seen as built up of recognizable ‘discursive practices’, such as those used in educational, legal, religious or political contexts. ‘Discourse’ points to the fact that language always occurs in specific social contexts and always reflects specific codes, expectations, ideological pressures and presuppositions. |
| double-voiced discourse (Bakhtin) | Refers to the idea that language is always double-voiced. No word has a single, independent meaning. All language is shot through with prior utterances, prior uses of the same words, and is always addressed towards other speakers. Bakhtin’s vision of double-voiced discourse is essentially intertextual, in that it recognizes that all utterances contain within them the dialogic force of competing interpretations, definitions, social and ideological inflections and so on.                                                                                                   |
| doxa (Barthes)                    | ‘-Doxy’ or ‘-doxa’ mean ‘opinion’. Barthes uses this suffix as a term for anything which constitutes general opinion, or is at any one moment in society considered unquestionable or natural.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ego (Freud)                       | A term only explainable in relation to the id and the superego. The id is that part of the unconscious which contains a subject’s desires, including frequently repressed sexual (libidinal) desires. The superego is that part of the conscious mind which, echoing received morality and ideology, strives to police the desires emanating from the id. The ego is the part of the psyche ‘which tries as best as it can to negotiate the conflicts between the insatiable demands of the id, the impossibly stringent requirements of the superego, and the limited possibilities of gratification offered by the world of “reality”’ (Abrams, 1993: 265).         |
| epitext (Genette)                 | Refers to ‘outside’ elements which help us interpret a text (letters, interviews and so on). Genette contrasts ‘epitextual’ features with what he calls the peritext, which consists of all the features which literally frame a text, such as prefaces, covers, titles and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| facticity (Bloom)                 | Term based on ‘fact’, also punning on ‘fictitious’, and perhaps ‘factive’ (‘causative’). Refers to the unavoidable influence of certain canonical writers. Shakespeare’s plays may have been fictitious, but their influence on every subsequent writer gives them the status of facts, or facticity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| filiation                         | ‘Filial’ relations are family relations. The traditional notion of authorship views the author as a kind of parent giving life to a text. This ‘myth of filiation’ is attacked by poststructuralists such as Barthes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| free indirect discourse           | Refers to the manner in which ‘the reports of what a character says and thinks shift in pronouns, adverbs, tense, and grammatical mode, as we move – or sometimes hover – between the direct narrated reproduction of such events by the narrator. Thus, a direct representation, “He thought, ‘I will see her home now, and may then stop at my mother’s’,” might shift, in an indirect representation, to: “He would see her home then, and might afterwards stop at his mother’s”’ (Abrams, 1993: 169). Allows a narrator to merge their own voice with the inner thoughts or the speech of a particular character.   |
| genotext (Kristeva)               | Refers to elements of a text which unleash or signal semiotic forces which derive from the earliest stages of a subject’s existence, when drives and desires are not controlled and channelled into the ‘Symbolic Order’ (the social categories and divisions of language). Texts which unleash the genotext are resistant to social standards of communication, breaking stylistic and linguistic conventions, and tend to be those of avant-garde and experimental writers. In contrast, Kristeva refers to the phenotext, which can be described as ‘the language of communication and ... the object of [traditional] linguistic analysis’ (Roudiez in Kristeva, 1980: 7). Texts which attempt to produce clear and unequivocal meaning will be almost totally describable in terms of the phenotext.             |
| gynocriticism                     | ‘Criticism concerned with writings by women ... and all aspects of their production and interpretation’ (Cuddon, 1992: 340); ‘the branch of modern feminist literary studies that focuses on women as writers, as distinct from the feminist critique of male authors’ (Baldick, 1990: 93).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| hegemony                          | The OED defines that which is ‘hegemonic’ as ‘the ruling part, the master-principle’. Often used to refer to power which is so dominant that it appears unquestionable, even natural.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| heteroglossia, heteroglot (Bakhtin) | Hetero, Gr. ‘other’ + glossia Gr. ‘tongue’: ‘other-tongued’, ‘other-voiced’. Defined by Graham Roberts thus: ‘heteroglossia ... refers to the conflict between “centripetal” and “centrifugal”, “official” and “unofficial” discourses within the same national language’. The term also has a smaller-scale application: ‘every utterance contains within it the trace of other utterances, both in the past and in the future’ (Roberts in Morris, 1994: 248–49). If we call an utterance ‘heteroglot’ we refer to the presence within it of other utterances, past utterances and future responses or redeployments. A heteroglot utterance would openly attest to the dialogic nature of language, and could be contrasted to an utterance which concealed such features and presented itself as monoglot.

| hybridization (Bakhtin)           | ‘The mixing, within a single concrete utterance, of two or more different linguistic consciousnesses, often widely separated in time and social space’ (Clark and Holquist, 1984: 429).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| hypertextuality (Genette)         | ‘Any relationship uniting a text B ( ... the hypertext) to an earlier text A (... the hypotext), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary’ (Genette, 1997a: 5). Genette tends to limit his analysis to satire and intentional relations of this kind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| hypogram (Riffaterre)             | ‘The text imagined in its pretransformational state’ (Riffaterre, 1978: 63). Since, for Riffaterre, all texts are transformations of small units of meaning, the hypogram is the series of basic units upon which the text is built: ‘The hypogram may be made out of clichés, or it may be a quotation from another text, or a descriptive system’ (ibid.:63–64).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| ideologeme (Kristeva)             | Fredric Jameson defines this as ‘the smallest intelligible unit of the essentially antagonistic collective discourses of social classes’ (Hawthorn, 1992: 80). Kristeva employs the term in the context of her work on Bakhtin and relates it to the manner in which texts do not simply reflect but contain elements of society’s ideological structures and struggles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| intermediality                    | The application of ideas of intertextuality to the emergence and history of media. In recent years, intermediality has somewhat separated from intertextual theory and focused more specifically on screen media, the new digital media, and the relation between visual and textual media (such as book to theatre or film adaptation, book to digital media, or such as games, digital art, and so on), along with born-digital art and its relation (positive or negative) to artistic traditions of a more textual nature.                                                                                                |

| jouissance                        | Fr. ‘bliss’, often in the sense of sexual climax. Used in poststructuralist theory, notably in Barthes’s The Pleasure of the Text. He distinguishes between the text which gives plaisir (pleasure) and the text which gives jouissance (bliss). The former he associates with the kind of text which he had previously called lisible (readerly), the latter with the kind of text he had called scriptible (writerly).                                                                                                                                        |

| langue (Saussure)                 | Refers to language in its synchronic state, as it is shared by every member of a speaking community. It involves the rules of combination, definitions and distinctions which operate in language at any moment in time. Parole concerns the activation of such rules in particular utterances. Thus parole can be seen as each specific utterance or utilization of the system of langue. Saussure also uses the term langage. Since langue is an abstract system of rules and codes, it is not simply the accumulation of all acts of utterance, parole. Even if we could group all utterances together, we would not describe the full extent of langue. Langage stands for that sum total of all acts of parole, and so is to be distinguished from the abstract system, langue.                      |
| lisible (Barthes)                 | Fr. ‘legible’. A lisible or ‘readerly text’ encourages readers to view themselves as decipherers of meanings already existent in the text itself. Contrasted with the scriptible text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| matrix (Riffaterre)               | Refers to a word, phrase or sentence upon which the whole semiotic structure of a text is built. The matrix might not be linguistically present in the text, but would be the basis for the text’s invariants, its recognizable patterns and structures, all of which will be transformations of that matrix. The word model is also employed by Riffaterre to refer to this idea of texts as constructed through transformations of basic elements of meaning.                                                                                                           |
| metafiction                       | ‘Fiction about fiction; or more especially a kind of fiction that openly comments on its own fictional status ... the term is normally used for works that involve a significant degree of self-consciousness about themselves as fictions’ (Baldick, 1990: 133).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| metatextuality (Genette)          | ‘The relationship most often labelled “commentary”. It unites a given text to another of which it speaks without necessarily citing it ... sometimes even without naming it’ (Genette, 1997a: 4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| mimesis                           | From Gr. ‘imitation’. The idea that art directly represents external reality. Mimetic views of art are severely challenged by theories of intertextuality, which argue that art works, or ‘texts’, refer not directly to external reality but to other texts. For a somewhat different approach, however, see Mary Orr (2003: 94–129).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Modernism                         | A period of cultural and aesthetic practice usually dated from the beginning of the twentieth century. Not to be confused with ‘modernity’, which is often used as a term for ideas concerning human and social progress stemming from the eighteenth century. Many movements called Modernist argued that an increase in technological sophistication would liberate society, or at least art, from the shackles of tradition and conformity to established rules and norms.                                                                                                                     |

| polyphony (Bakhtin)               | (From Gr. ‘many-voicedness’). ‘A polyphonic novel is one in which several different voices or points of view interact on more or less equal terms’ (Baldick, 1990: 173). It demonstrates and celebrates the dialogic nature of society by presenting a vision of human society dominated by the dialogue and play between voices and utterances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| polysemy                          | Poly, from Gr. ‘much’, ‘many’ + semeio, ‘sign’ or ‘signal’. That which is polysemous has many meanings or significations. Employed within poststructuralist theory as a way of resisting traditional notions of the singularity of meaning and thus of texts and signs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Postmodernism                     | A term which has emerged since the 1970s, suggesting a break from Modernism or from the notion of ‘modernity’. Since it attempts to represent contemporary trends, Postmodernism is a particularly debated term. However, there are recurrent themes in these debates. Firstly, the idea that national limits for social and cultural identity have been superseded by a global environment in which multinational companies are now more important than national governments in directing social and cultural tendencies. Secondly, such a transnational system is characterized by ‘empty signifiers’, or representations and signs which have no base in a recognizable, lived reality. Many descriptions of Postmodernism depict a transnational cultural situation in which pastiche and parody of earlier forms and styles predominate. Postmodern art, many argue, rejects notions of originality and Modernism’s desire to ‘Make it New’, and cultivates a wilfully derivative, mixed and thoroughly intertextual approach which attempts to capture a new age in which old certainties about historical knowledge, social progress and even the ability to represent the external world have collapsed. |
| poststructuralism                 | Poststructuralist theorists argued that Saussurean structuralism did not provide scientific objectivity and methodological stability but, rather, demonstrated the unstable nature of language and of meaning. Poststructuralists deny any claims for a scientific study of texts or cultural sign systems and insist that all texts are polysemous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| revisionary ratios (Bloom)        | In historical and political studies ‘revisionism’ concerns the rewriting of the standard accounts of historical events, often for contemporary ideological purposes or to expose the ideological purposes of prior, established and apparently ‘neutral’ accounts. Bloom uses revisionary ratios to refer to the different ways in which poets seek to rewrite the works of previous poets.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| rhizome (Deleuze and Guattari)    | In botany, a rhizome (from Ancient Greek, rhízo-ma, ‘mass of roots’) involves the way in which main roots spread out horizontally underground. In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari use it as an alternative to the traditional figure of the tree. If the latter is the basis for traditional organic thinking, the rhizome represents a non-teleological, non-hierarchical, horizontal understanding of knowledge, identity, and power-relations.                                                                                                                    |
| satire                            | A text which ridicules or ironically comments on socially recognizable tendencies or the style or form of another text or author. Close to the concept of parody, but traditionally has a more moralistic intention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| semianalysis                      | Kristeva’s term to characterize her approach to semiotics. She defines it as a ‘critique of meaning, of its elements and its laws’ (Kristeva, 1980: 4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| semiotic, the (Kristeva)          | ‘The flow of pre-linguistic rhythms or “pulsions” that is broken up by the child’s entry into the Symbolic order of language. The unconscious energies of the semiotic are repressed and marginalized by patriarchal logic and rationality but they may still disrupt the Symbolic order, transgressing its rigid categories (including those of identity and sexual difference)’ (Baldick, 1990: 201). Kristeva at times refers to language in its ‘semiotic phase’ (the language of pre-linguistic subjectivity), as opposed to language in its ‘thetic phase’ (the language of the subject after entry into the Symbolic order).                      |
| semiotics, semiology (Saussure, C. S. Pierce) | ‘The systematic study of signs, or, more precisely, of the production of meanings from sign-systems, linguistic or non-linguistic’ (Baldick, 1990: 201). The relationship between sign and system is particularly important. Sign-systems can be any recognizable field of human communication. Clothing might signify within the cultural ‘fashion system’, for example. Semiotics and semiology as developed in structuralism and poststructuralism can treat anything emanating from a signifying system as a text to be read.                                                                                    |
| sign (Saussure)                   | A linguistic or non-linguistic element of communication. Saussure divides the sign into two parts: the signifier and the signified. The signifier is the material ‘sound pattern’, a written or spoken word, whilst the signified is the ‘concept’ associated with that particular signifier. For Saussure signs do not refer directly to things in the external world but have their meaning in terms of the relation between signifiers and signifieds, depending upon the synchronic system of language and its rules and codes of association, combination, definition and distinction.                     |
| signifiance (Kristeva, Barthes, poststructuralists) | As opposed to the term ‘signification’ and its association with clear communication of meaning, signifiance is used to refer to a kind of language ‘that enables a text to signify what representative and communicative speech does not say’ (Roudiez in Kristeva, 1980: 18). Signifiance also refers to the ‘production of meaning’ which the reader is involved in when reading such radical forms of language. Signification implies the creation of meaning before the act of reading; signifiance implies that meaning is only ever produced in the act of reading.                           |

| signifyin(g) (Gates)           | Refers to traditions in African-American culture which play upon conventional ‘white’ modes of signification.

| sociolect                      | ‘Used to denote language ... which is specific to a particular social group, and which carries with it the values and status of the same group. The social group in question can be defined in terms of class, ... age, or gender – or a permutation of all three’ (Hawthorn, 1992: 167). Often paired with idiolect, or ‘the features of a particular person’s language which mark out him or her individually from others’ (ibid.: 80).                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| split subject, the (Kristeva)  | The idea that the human subject is divided. In psychoanalysis the split is between the conscious and the unconscious, while for theorists such as Kristeva there are other interesting divisions, such as the split between semiotic and symbolic modes of language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| structuralism                  | A movement which stems particularly from Saussure’s vision of semiology, the study of all the sign-systems operative in culture. Structuralism took texts, from works of literature to aspects of everyday communication, and accounted for them in terms of the system from which they were produced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| subject of enunciation         | Distinguished in linguistics from the subject of utterance, which can be said to be the actual person who performs an act of communication. When that subject refers to itself as an ‘I’, however, it has become a subject of enunciation. This difference involves ‘the particular, time-bound act of making a statement, and the verbal result of that act, a result which escapes from the moment of time and from the possession of the person responsible for the act’ (Hawthorn, 1992: 57). A particular subject (of utterance) might write the words ‘I love you’ on a card. Years later, when this card is found by someone else, that subject has become merely a first-person pronoun in a conventional and depersonalized statement (subject of enunciation). The same process occurs in any act of writing or repeatable linguistic utterance.              |

| Tel Quel                       | A school of theory and writing formed in the 1960s and associated with many leading poststructuralist theorists of the period, including Kristeva, Derrida and Barthes. Tel Quel sought to theorize and unleash the revolutionary power of language and to celebrate writers who were seen as having performed a similar action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| text                           | From L. texere, textum ‘to weave’, ‘woven’ (Cuddon, 1992: 963). Traditionally, a text was the actual words or signs which made up a work of literature. It gave permanence to the work. In structuralist and poststructuralist theory the ‘text’ comes to stand for whatever meaning is generated by the intertextual relations between one text and another and the activation of those relations by a reader. ‘Text’ becomes a term associated with the absence of stable and permanent meaning, while ‘work’ is now associated with the idea of a stable and self-contained meaning.                                                                                                                                                       |

| trace                          | According to Derrida, ‘every sign ... contains a trace of other signs which differ from itself. ... No sign is complete in itself. One sign leads to another via the trace – indefinitely’ (Cuddon, 1992: 981).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| transcendental signified (Derrida) | A sign which provides a centre for a particular linguistic system. As a centre, it promotes stability, presence and singular, transparent meaning, because its own meaning is not dependent upon any other sign. The signs ‘God’, ‘Justice’ or ‘Truth’ function in this way. Without these ‘transcendental signs’ the traditional notion of the discursive systems of religion, law and philosophy would collapse due to a lack of cohesion and the lack of a central term. Derrida argues that no sign can ever attain such a position, since every sign has its meaning in relation to other signs. Demonstrating this forms a large part of his deconstruction of the traditional fields of Western thought.  |
| transposition (Kristeva)       | Used to reinforce the notion that intertextual processes have nothing to do with traditional notions concerning ‘influence’. Far from an author-to-author transmission of ideas and styles, Kristeva argues that intertextuality, or what she renames transposition, concerns the way in which one ‘sign system’ is incorporated into another ‘sign system’ and the semiotic changes this transposition entails.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| transtextuality (Genette)      | ‘The textual transcendence of the text ... defined roughly as “all that sets the text in a relationship, whether obvious or concealed, with other texts”’ (Genette, 1997a: 1). Genette’s term transtextuality is his particular variation on the idea most other critics call intertextuality. He reduces the term intertextuality to ‘a relationship of copresence between two texts or among several texts ... the actual presence of one text within another’ (Genette, 1997a: 1–2).                                                                                                                                    |

| ungrammaticality (Riffaterre)  | Refers to anything within a text which alerts the reader to a meaning or structural pattern beyond or below that of the referential or mimetic level of a text. A poem, for example, might have a title which does not seem in any way to relate to the text of the poem itself. The ungrammaticality may well be resolved, however, if the reader shifts from a mimetic to a semiotic level of reading.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
