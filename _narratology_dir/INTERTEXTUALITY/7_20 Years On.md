### Short Summaries
1. **The concept of intertextuality has evolved over the past two decades, adapting to changes in digital media and cultural studies, and now plays a crucial role in the emerging field of intermediality.**
2. **Intermediality, a concept stemming from intertextuality, explores the interactions between different media, emphasizing the dynamic and anti-essentialist nature of media development.**

### Style
- **Analytical, Contextual, Theoretical**

### Arguments
1. **Intermediality extends the concept of intertextuality by focusing on the interactions between different media, emphasizing the evolving and dynamic nature of media and textual relations.**
2. **The shift from print to digital culture necessitates a reevaluation of intertextuality, incorporating new media theories and practices to better understand the contemporary landscape of meaning-making.**
3. **Cognitive poetics and narrative analysis provide new insights into intertextuality by focusing on how real readers engage with texts, making connections that shape their reading experiences.**
4. **The current media environment, dominated by digital technologies, requires a renewed focus on how intertextual and intermedial practices shape our understanding of texts and cultural artifacts.**

### Detailed Summary
**It has been 20 years since the first publication of Intertextuality in Routledge’s New Critical Idiom series. In this third revision of the final chapter, the focus is on new developments in the study and theory of intertextuality and its future direction. The past decade has been marked by significant social, economic, and ecological crises, affecting the vibrancy of cultural and literary theory. Unlike the exuberant theoretical debates of the 1960s and 1970s, recent years have seen a more defensive and professionalized approach to theory within academia.**

**Intermediality, a concept that emerged from theoretical work in Germany in the 1970s, has gained prominence in cultural and media studies. It focuses on how new, often digital, media adapt earlier media forms and represent the contemporary world. Rémy Besson's definition of intermediality emphasizes the study of the dynamic, ephemeral, and evolving nature of media. This anti-essentialist approach aligns with Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin's concept of remediation, which explores how new media continuously adapt and reformat older media.**

**Intermediality shares with intertextuality a focus on the "betweenness" of elements, whether temporal, spatial, or conceptual. It captures the infinite connections and pathways between different forms of media and representation. Despite the overlapping concerns, there is a distinction between intertextuality, which primarily deals with textual relationships, and intermediality, which addresses interactions between media forms.**

**Jessica Mason's work on intertextuality in practice within cognitive poetics and narrative analysis highlights how readers make connections between texts in real situations. Her focus on narrative schemas, or the mental archives of readers, provides a framework for understanding how individuals engage with and interpret texts intertextually.**

**The rise of digital media and the interconnected nature of contemporary culture have transformed how we understand and study intertextuality. Hypertextuality and new media technologies embody the de-centered textual experiences described by poststructuralist theorists. The evolving digital landscape requires a renewed focus on how intertextual and intermedial practices shape our understanding of texts, meaning-making, and cultural artifacts.**

**In conclusion, the study of intertextuality must adapt to the changing media environment, incorporating insights from intermediality, cognitive poetics, and digital media theories. This adaptation will enable a deeper understanding of the dynamic and interconnected nature of contemporary texts and cultural practices.**

### Detailed Summary
**It is 20 years since I first published Intertextuality in Routledge’s New Critical Idiom series. As with the new chapter in the second edition of the book (Allen, 2011), I want to take the opportunity of this third revision of the final chapter to discuss what is new in the study and the theory of intertextuality. I also, however, want to discuss more personally where I think intertextuality might take us in the future.**

**Emerging from theoretical work in Germany in the 1970s and spreading out into the world of Cultural Studies and Media Studies, various theories of intermediality seem appropriate to those wishing to focus on how new, often digital, media adapt earlier book-based media, or how those newer media represent and mediate the contemporary world. A good definition of the spirit of much work in this field (if only a partial definition of the term itself) is found in Rémy Bresson’s ‘Intermediality: Axis of Relevance’ (2015), when he writes:**

**The notion of intermediality ... is particularly useful in that it maintains for as long as possible, the taking into account of a certain degree of heterogeneity among the elements that make up a medium still caught in a process of becoming. This, in turn, makes it possible to avoid adopting an anachronistic and teleological standpoint or, in other words, to avoid taking for granted that the emergence of a medium is self-evident and that medium is an entity with fixed and natural properties. In this way, intermedial thinking is anti-essentialist: it promotes the study of dynamics, the ephemeral, the evanescent, or even that which has not yet occurred. (ibid.: 145)**

**Jessica Mason's work on intertextuality in practice within cognitive poetics and narrative analysis highlights how readers make connections between texts in real situations. Her focus on narrative schemas, or the mental archives of readers, provides a framework for understanding how individuals engage with and interpret texts intertextually. Mason's data-driven approach emphasizes observable and repeatable results, suitable for the age of digital media and computer-assisted analysis. However, this approach may lack the fluidity and complexity of earlier theories.**

**Scarlett Baron's genealogical study of intertextuality traces its development from the nineteenth century to contemporary debates. Baron addresses key areas of confusion in intertextual theory, including the role of the author, the referential nature of texts, and the tension between literary production and reception. Her examination provides a deeper understanding of where these issues originate and why they persist. Baron’s work emphasizes the plural, heterogeneous, and highly debated nature of intertextuality, providing a comprehensive historical context for the concept.**

**Intermediality and remediation offer new frameworks for understanding how digital media adapt and transform earlier textual forms. Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin's concept of remediation explores how new media continuously adapt and reformat older media, highlighting the dynamic and evolving nature of textual relationships. This approach aligns with the anti-essentialist spirit of intermedial thinking and emphasizes the ongoing transformation of media and textuality.**

**In conclusion, the study of intertextuality must adapt to the changing media environment, incorporating insights from intermediality, cognitive poetics, and digital media theories. This adaptation will enable a deeper understanding of the dynamic and interconnected nature of contemporary texts and cultural practices. The future of intertextuality lies in balancing the pragmatic, data-driven approaches with the more complex, theoretical perspectives that acknowledge the fluid and porous nature of language.**

### Detailed Summary
**Intertextuality as a theoretical concept has continued to evolve, particularly in response to the rise of digital media and the insights provided by cognitive poetics. Jessica Mason’s work on narrative schemas highlights the practical ways in which readers make intertextual connections, emphasizing a data-driven approach that contrasts with the fluid and porous nature of language discussed by earlier theorists.**

**Scarlett Baron’s genealogical study provides a comprehensive history of intertextuality, tracing its development from the nineteenth century through the works of key figures such as Darwin, Bergson, and T.S. Eliot, and into contemporary debates. Baron addresses key areas of confusion in intertextual theory, such as the role of the author and the nature of textual reference, offering a nuanced understanding of the concept’s evolution.**

**The ongoing debates around intertextuality reflect broader tensions between pragmatic, observable analysis and the more complex, infinite nature of textual relationships emphasized by poststructuralist theorists like Barthes and Kristeva. These debates underscore the importance of intermediality and remediation as frameworks for understanding how digital media transform earlier textual forms.**

**The future of intertextuality involves balancing these pragmatic and theoretical approaches, recognizing the dynamic and interconnected nature of texts in the digital age. The notion of intertextuality continues to challenge traditional ideas about intention, meaning, and literature, highlighting the plurality and proliferation of meanings inherent in all language.**

**Responses to Barthes and Kristeva often revive a conservative reaction against the proliferation of meaning, echoing historical concerns about the overabundance of books and cultural content. However, true engagement with intertextuality must start with this unmanageable plurality, defining its own modes of compression and reduction while acknowledging the inherent complexity and interconnectedness of all texts.**
