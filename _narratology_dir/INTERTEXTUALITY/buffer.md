Poststructuralists go further than this, however, and refer to a loss of the subject in language generally. This concerns the ‘apersonal’ nature of language in general; a feature highlighted if we attend to the pronouns we are forced to employ when referring to ourselves and to others. As J. A. Cuddon writes: [Benveniste] distinguishes between the ‘personal’ and ‘apersonal’ aspects of language. In one sense ‘I’ is personal; in another, apersonal. When apersonal, ‘I’ is nothing other than ‘the person who utters the present instance of discourse containing the linguistic instance “I”’. (Cuddon, 1992: 928) 39 ORIGIN

When a dignitary utters the words ‘I name this ship so-and-so’, they may believe that it matters that it is they themselves that are speaking. However, the reality is that, so long as someone of appropriate social stature says these words, then the words will have the same effect upon reality. The meaning and effect of the ‘I’ in that sentence is not dependent upon the particular subject who utters them. What matters is that the clichéd phrase has been spoken, as it has many times before, and the fact that it is addressed to an audience, who are taking up a position of witnesses to an event (naming a ship) which has occurred many times previously and will occur countless times in the future. If a member of the audience with sufficient social standing were to change places with the specific speaker of the sentence, it would not at all affect the act of naming the ship. The example of naming a ship might appear to involve a rather uncommon event, and thus not to be of particular relevance to language in its everyday use. However, poststructuralists argue that a similar substitutability occurs in all language use. Whenever subjects enter language they enter into situations in which their personal subjectivity is lost. Perhaps the reason we tend to say ‘I really love you’ or ‘I really do like your shoes’ is that even these common phrases are haunted by the same kind of substitutability as the sentence in which someone names a ship. ‘I love you’ is a cliché, said millions of times before, and we cannot perhaps but be nervous about a loss of the very subjectivity we would express by these words when we utter them. The ‘I’ in the sentence ‘I love you’ is rather less expressive of our own personal feelings and subjecthood than we would like to believe. What is clear is that when we are dealing with literary forms of writing we cannot presume that the language we are dealing with gives us direct access to the subject who wrote it. Even in confessional modes of writing, the ‘I’ of the text cannot be identical to the authorial ‘I’, as we are dealing with a subject of enunciation rather than a subject of utterance. Authors can write narratives using the first person pronoun ‘I’, or the ‘nonperson pronoun’ (Kristeva, 1980: 87) ‘he/she’, or in a collective ‘we’, or through their own or another proper name. Roland Barthes, in his critical 40 ORIGIN

memoir Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes, exploits these points by referring to himself throughout the text in the third-person ‘he’. Such a technique foregrounds the point that the person who speaks or acts and the person who writes are never identical. The subject, ‘he’, represented in Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes, cannot, linguistically, be identical to the subject (Roland Barthes) who performs the act of representation in that text. The very title of the text, ‘doubling’ the name of the author/subject, makes this point. We might believe that our name always refers to the individual, unique person that we are, but the pronouns we use to refer to ourselves frequently shift our positions, from personal (‘I’) to collective (‘we’) to third-person (‘he’ or ‘she’). In language, our subject positions shift; in writing, the subject is lost. In the above senses then, the word but also the subject-position of the person who speaks in literary language is double-voiced. The pronominal ‘I’ is always directed towards an ‘other’, and employs words that are themselves directed towards and contain within themselves ‘other words’ and ‘other utterances’. It is also itself double, the product of a subject ‘outside’ the text and the pronominal subject of the text itself. For Kristeva, the ‘outside’ subject is not at issue, since in writing all we can know is the apersonal, constantly shifting, pronominal subject. The subject in writing is always double because the words that subject utters are intertextual (clichéd, already written), and the pronominal signifiers which refer to that subject are always changing and have no stable signified (‘outside’ subject) to which they can be referred. Kristeva’s use of the word ‘ambivalence’ represents one of the many intertextual revisions to be found in her reading of Bakhtin. The Bakhtinian terms standing behind Kristeva’s new term are ‘heteroglossia’ and ‘hybridity’, and yet the new terminology implies a refocusing on logical criteria. Kristeva writes: Dialogue and ambivalence lead me to conclude that, within the interior space of the text as well as within the space of texts, poetic language is a ‘double’. Saussure’s poetic paragram (‘Anagrams’) extends from zero to two: the unit ‘one’ (definition, ‘truth’) does not exist in this field. Consequently, the notions of definition, determination, the sign ‘ = ’ and the very concept of the sign, which 41 ORIGIN

presupposes a vertical (hierarchical) division between signifier and signified, cannot be applied to poetic language – by definition an infinity of pairings and combinations. (Kristeva, 1980: 69) Kristeva thus employs Bakhtin’s emphasis on the doubleness or dialogic quality of words and utterances to attack notions of unity, which she associates with claims to authoritativeness, unquestionable truth, unproblematic communication and society’s desire to repress plurality. Kristeva’s attack, in other words, is against the foundations of Western logic. Such a logic, stemming from Aristotle, works on the principle of non-contradiction. As Aristotle asserts, something cannot at one and the same time be something (A) and something else (not-A). If A, for example, represents ‘here’, and if not-A represents ‘there’, then, such logic would argue, a person cannot at one and the same time occupy space A and space not-A. Kristeva’s point is that, with Bakhtin’s view of the word or utterance, we find a fundamental challenge to Aristotelian logic and its notions of singularity. The dialogic word or utterance is double-voiced, heteroglot, and possesses a meaning (A) at the same moment that it possesses an alternative meaning or meanings (not-A). Mary Shelley’s sentence about England, for example, refers to a fictional narrative at the same moment as it refers to an actual country’s ideological representations of itself; it is at once her own utterance and the utterance of a fictional character. As such, the meaning of Shelley’s sentence defies Aristotelian logic, since it at one and the same time has an ‘inside’ and an ‘outside’ referent, and is the utterance of at least two linguistic subjects. It is, in this sense, ‘A’ and ‘not-A’. Saussure’s work on anagrams marks a fascinatingly undiscussed element in the development of poststructuralist theories of textuality and intertextuality. The unfinished work remained in manuscript form until it began to be rediscovered by certain theorists, the French theorist Jean Starobinski in particular. Starobinski’s research on the project was published in Mercure de France in 1964 and in Tel Quel (37, spring 1969), finally emerging as a partial translation and commentary (see Starobinski, 1979). Julia Kristeva first used Saussure’s theory in an article in 42 ORIGIN

Tel Quel in 1967 (see Kristeva, 1998a). Working on mainly Greek and Latin poetry, Saussure argued – but never finally proved to his own satisfaction – that these texts worked on nonrepresentational levels in which groups of letters and phonemes (sounds), such as the first and last letters of consecutive lines, arranged themselves into deep textual units, often the names of Gods or heroes. So that, for example, in studying the arrangement of phonemes within a piece of poetry mentioned by the Roman historian Livy, Saussure discovers the name of the Greek and Roman sungod Apollo, despite the fact that Apollo is never literally (directly through the signifier ‘Apollo’) mentioned in the text. Saussure, as he discovered more and more varieties of such coded patterns, coined more and more cognate terms to capture such processes. As Kristeva and Derrida both recognize, Saussure’s work on the ‘gram’ foreshadows their own work on the manner in which signifiers in the text exist in relation to chains of further signifiers, rather than in relation to transparent and stable signifieds. Saussure’s work on anagrams is seen by Kristeva and Derrida as foreshadowing their own focus on how the signifier resists notions of direct or logical communication and thus meaning. It may well seem perverse on Kristeva’s part to conduct a reading of Bakhtinian notions ‘insofar as they are congruent with the conceptions of Ferdinand de Saussure as related to his “anagrams”’ (1980: 90). Kristeva rewrites Bakhtin’s work, however, directing it towards a language conceived as beyond logic. If logic is based on Aristotle’s assertion that something is either ‘A’ or ‘not-A’, then we might say that logic presumes that things cannot be more than one thing at a time. Something is what it is, or it is nothing. Kristeva’s way of expressing this is to use the numerical expression (0 – 1): ‘0’ here equals ‘nothing’, ‘1’ here equals a singular element. On this basis, Kristeva sees a similarity between Bakhtin’s view of language and Saussure’s work on anagrams, a similarity which for her connects them to Freud’s work on the non-logical language of dreams, or what Freud calls dream-work. Saussure’s theory of anagrams functions as one more apparently scientifically oriented discursive practice that can be strategically addressed to a kind of language which remains 43 ORIGIN

unassimilable within any science or logic; a kind of language that is ambivalent. Poetic language, as Kristeva stresses, works on the principal of 0 – 2, it is ‘double’, both ‘A’ and ‘not-A’. Here, ‘0’ equals ‘nothing’, whilst ‘2’ equals an element which is at least ‘double’; that which equals a single element, ‘1’, has been omitted. Kristeva writes: the minimal unit of poetic language is at least double, not in the sense of the signifier/signified dyad, but rather, in terms of one and other ... The double would be the minimal sequence of a paragrammatic semiotics to be worked out starting from the work of Saussure ... and Bakhtin. (Kristeva, 1980: 69) Poetic language, Kristeva argues, foregrounds the ‘inability of any logical system based on a zero-one sequence (true-false, nothingness-notation)’ (1980: 70). A whole host of additional vocabularies, linguistic, psychoanalytic and mathematical, allows Kristeva to appropriate Bakhtinian dialogism and to re-establish it upon the opposition between the monologic (0 – 1) and the dialogic (0 – 2). As she writes: ‘Within this “power of the continuum” from 0 to a specifically poetic double, the linguistic, psychic, and social “prohibition” is 1 (God, Law, Definition). The only linguistic practice to “escape” this prohibition is poetic discourse’ (ibid.: 70). If we accept Bakhtin’s vision of society as always exhibiting a conflict between monologic and dialogic forces, then the monologic forces will argue for what it takes to be logical (0 – 1), whilst dialogic forces, for Kristeva ‘poetic language’, will constantly struggle to express the non-logical (0 – 2). Notions of unquestionable authority and singularity –‘God, Law, Definition’–always work on the side of monologic power. If intertextuality stands as the ultimate term for the kind of poetic language Kristeva is attempting to describe, then we can see that from its beginning the concept of intertextuality is meant to designate a kind of language which, because of its embodiment of otherness, is against, beyond and resistant to (mono)logic. Such language is socially disruptive, revolutionary even. Intertextuality encompasses that aspect of literary and other kinds of texts which 44 ORIGIN

struggles against and subverts reason, the belief in unity of meaning or of the human subject, and which is therefore subversive to all ideas of the logical and the unquestionable. We can register how far Kristeva’s version of dialogism pushes this attack on unity and reason by referring to her reading of Bakhtin in relation to dialectics, an idea associated with the German Romantic philosopher G. W. F. Hegel. Hegelian dialectics depends upon the production of a synthesis out of the clash between a thesis and an antithesis. The synthesis is a ‘third term’, which not only resolves the clash between thesis and antithesis but takes us to a new, ‘higher’ position or state of consciousness or knowledge. Dialectics, therefore, implies that human thought and society can transcend or leap to a totality of knowledge, a third position, which resolves prior conflicts and ambivalences. In less totalized fashion, it at least suggests that the kind of ‘doubleness’ Kristeva finds in Bakhtin’s work and in what she calls ‘poetic language’, can be resolved by a ‘progression’ to a new, resolved, position. In Hegelian dialectics, we might say, following Kristeva’s arguments, since the clash between thesis and antithesis is resolved by the emergence of a synthesis, the notion of the monologic, of the restoration of singularity and unity is restored. What Bakhtin calls the dialogic is cancelled in dialectics by the move to a new, transcendent monological position. Marx famously adapted dialectics to argue that the clash of the proletariat and the owners of capital would bring a revolutionary third position, a social order beyond the power-struggles between workers and capitalists. It should be noted, as a fact not without interest to Kristeva’s arguments, that Marx gradually incorporated a notion of counter-revolution, of the revolutionary transcendence of conflict leading to renewed conflict, within his political theories. When Kristeva directs her Bakhtin-inspired semiotics against Hegel, as in the following passage, she is, then, also attacking a much debated feature of Marxist thought: The notion of dialogism, which owes much to Hegel, must not be confused with Hegelian dialectics, based on a triad and thus on struggle and projection (a movement of transcendence), which does not transgress the Aristotelian tradition founded on substance and 45 ORIGIN

causality. Dialogism replaces these concepts by absorbing them within the concept of relation. It does not strive towards transcendence but rather toward harmony, all the while implying an idea of rupture (of opposition and analogy) as a modality of transformation. (Kristeva, 1980: 88–89) Kristeva’s vision is not of transcendence but of production. The language of logic, reason and Law (0 – 1) is constantly ruptured, transformed and repositioned by that which cannot be confined within the logical, the meaningful or the literally communicable (0 – 2). As she writes elsewhere, paraphrasing Bakhtin on the polyphonic novel: ‘Dostoevsky’s “model” lacks unity of speaker and of meaning; it is plural, anti-totalitarian and anti-theological. It thus exemplifies permanent contradiction, and could never have anything in common with Hegelian dialectic’ (Kristeva, 1973: 110; see also Todorov, 1984: 104). To understand further what Kristeva does with such a position, and what implications it has for her account of the text and of intertextuality, we need to move away from her engagement with Bakhtin towards her development of semianalysis, a practice increasingly dependent on a psychoanalytical theory of the subject in language.
