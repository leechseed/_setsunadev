he most common narrative modes can be characterized by their positioning as “anteriority stories.” In the sharpest formulation, a visual work is thus considered an illustration of the narrative that precedes it and to which it is subordinated, its success being measured in terms of the degree to which it matches the story. Various practices of iconography exemplify the problems this narrative mode of anteriority poses. For example, iconographic analysis is often a search for antecedent works of art, for other images in which motifs, poses, compositional schemas, conceptualizations, or allegories were already used, whereby the later work becomes affiliated with visual predecessors. The narrative of anteriority uses the prior text, or image, as a measuring stick. This is what iconography does to Bourgeois’s work: the spiders are metaphors for the artist’s mother; the tapestries come from and hence are metonymies of the parents’ workshop. Why, then, can we not “own” those stories, read them “off the page” so that they replace the mute objects we see? The major thrust of such anteriority narratives is its diminishing of the studied work’s originality in a justified impulse to shed Romantic notions of art. Thus, where Caravaggio or Rembrandt were once considered geniuses, they have now become craftsmen doing a job for patrons, who, it must therefore be deduced, really invented the work. Artists have cannil

The Narrator 51 led the way to this much-needed revision of Romantic preconceptions of art. A work such as Spider, which integrates discarded perfume bottles, pieces of bone, and old fabric, a work where nothing in itself bears the artist’s signature as “hand,” must certainly agree with such a rejection of the idolatry of originality. It has, in fact, proposed that rejection. However welcome this anti-Romantic attitude may have been at the time, though, it has now become a paradoxical tool to undermine the art it is alleged to serve. For it risks defeating the point of visual art, which is not to reiterate but to innovate, in the sense of offering for its viewers’ experiences and insights, sights and sites in the present, that we did not as yet possess. This has nothing to do with Romantic originality. It has a lot to do with art’s efficacy, rather than its “essence,” with an understanding of art as process, with cultural life at the crossroads of significant events. Thus, by specifically ignoring the visuality of a particular work, a narrative of anteriority bypasses what the work of art, as a theoretical object, has to say. To reject this, I contend, is one of Spider’s and Bourgeois’s other artworks’ theoretical propositions. They effectuate that proposition, enunciate it, through its imposition of a bodily participation by the viewer, who, caught between narrativity and sculpturality, builds a home for the old stories in the now. This, not the explicit use of “you,” is what give this artwork a second-person narrator. Yet if we want to dream about a non-reductive engagement with visual art, Borges’s reason-based subjectivity must be allowed to go to sleep. In its dreams, then, it will meet its counterpart. With this metaphor of sleep, I am alluding to the contribution of psychoanalysis to this discussion of second-person narrative. As is well-known, psychoanalytical criticism is by definition committed to exploring unconscious impulses alleged to pour forth from the work. Pouring forth as address, going towards the second persons. Strictly speaking, such criticism cannot appeal to intentionalist statements at all. The conception of the subject underlying such criticism is, or ought to be, that of a split subject, who, to use Freud’s words, is not master in his or her own house. In the case of Bourgeois’s Cells, and particularly of Spider, this Freudian phrase is strikingly apt. The Cells are, or represent, houses, in a literal sense, through the enclosed shape and shelter they suggest (Figure 13). This is their primal sense of architecture. They are both building blocks and complete houses. Body-houses. The Cells militate against the predominant model, in that art of building the house as a unified, idealized, symmetrical body. And they are, represent, or rather perform the house where the Freudian subject, whose own house it is, is not the master. For by deploying address, the house is unmasterable but yields to the second person the power it declines for itself

52 Text: Signs According to Bourgeois’s Spider, there are two reasons for this. First, figuratively, the Cells are houses of the mind, facilitating the childhood memories they obviously shelter. The huge spider brings in its wake the small child who first saw it. That anteriority, rather than the biographical one, infuses the work with an outrageous instability of scale that turns a sculpture into a building and back again. This is the level on which the narrator’s utterance – not specific narrative content – serves as the cement that builds the house. Second, the particular “theory” of conceitedness, which speaks through Bourgeois’s installation sculptures, requires a house, a habitat, for the subject to be, precisely, not master of. Instead, conceitedness functions on the dual level of the relationship between subject and other, in a one-to-one connection, and, simultaneously, on the level of the relationship between the subject – the one – and her surroundings, embodied by the house. In this duality, the subject cannot, by definition, be master. The Freudian sensibility, rather than the content of the Cells as houses of the mind, consists, moreover, of a precise, sensitive, and Figure 13. Louise Bourgeois, Spider

The Narrator 53 very subtle resonance with the famous master/house metaphor from the creator of psychoanalysis. For masterful works of art as these are, “mastery” is not the sense they convey. Instead, “mystery” is more like it. Their strong affect and power of meaning-production suggest precisely the kind of subjectivity that would generate what psychoanalyst Christopher Bollas (1987) felicitously termed “the unthought known.” This is something the subject senses and on which it acts but which it cannot articulate in a fully rational discourse – the intellectual discourse of artist’s statements, for example. Yet at the same time, this “unthought known” is something the subject does know thinkingly and needs to make and mould so that it can actively – but outside intellectual discourse – participate in the cultural process that leads to knowledge. Boldly, then, Bourgeois’s work engages in a theoretical debate with Freud, pushing this master’s tendency to anteriority narratives back to where, according to The Interpretation of Dreams (1982 [1900]), they emerge: in the visual present. The strong sense of mood, memory, and mystery that all the Cells emanate partakes of this realm of the unthought known. Accounting for the Cells through the words of the artist (alone), then, does them a profound injustice. If Bourgeois is such a strong spokeswoman for her own work, it is because thought, reason, is so very important to her art. The Cells are the work of Descartes’s daughter, who grudgingly takes up Vitruvius’s legacy in a revisionist conception of architecture that does not allow reduction to reason. If she makes works that are so replete with childhood memories – fragmented, allusive, yet powerfully present narratives – it is because she is also Freud’s friend. She knows, even if many of her critics don’t, that listening to her is fine but that repeating her words (only) reduces her work to just one side of a multifarious, multilayered complexity. Process happens when the narrative of viewing rivals the narrative of memory, whose presence one senses but cannot grasp. This is also the Borgesian moment when identity flounders, its uncertainty leaking from the work into the viewer. This is art’s way of performing narration with a second-person narrator. The viewer drawn into heteropathy does not emerge self-identical from the experience. The processual aspect of Bourgeois’s works is a strong counter-force against chronology, against the linear unfolding in time and the anteriority narratives it generates. The evocations and associations of the viewers function like the scraps of tapestry and the pieces of bone in Spider. The memories there are found objects that we routinely integrate into narrative frames derived from the cultural stock available to us. By presentin

54 Text: Signs memories as found objects, Bourgeois makes them appear as scraps of a past. Through the need to experience the temporality of looking, the narratives that turn this particular Cell into a house also slam the door on the viewer who is trying to read the stories, to turn them into anteriority narratives and thus cannibalize them. Her stories of the past stick to our stories of looking, but they remain opaque. What characterizes second-person narrative most profoundly, then, is not the “person,” which is mutually interchangeable anyway, but the tense; the present.
