I can describe how you might create diagrams to visualize the relationships and concepts from the narratology text. For detailed drawing, you could use tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, or Microsoft Visio. Here’s how you can structure your diagrams:

### 1. **Narrative Roles Diagram**
   - **Purpose:** To show the relationships and distinctions between the narrator, focalizer, and actors.
   - **Diagram Type:** Venn Diagram
   - **Elements:**
     - **Circle 1:** Narrator (with subtypes such as Visible Character, Abstract Agent)
     - **Circle 2:** Focalizer (label areas where it overlaps with Narrator to indicate situations where the narrator also serves as the focalizer)
     - **Circle 3:** Actor (show overlap with both Narrator and Focalizer where applicable)

### 2. **Narrative Forms and Their Effects**
   - **Purpose:** To compare the effects of different narrative perspectives (first-person, second-person, third-person).
   - **Diagram Type:** Comparative Table or Flowchart
   - **Elements:**
     - **Columns/Nodes:** First-Person, Second-Person, Third-Person
     - **Rows/Connections:** Effects on Storytelling, Perception by Audience, Usage in Texts

### 3. **Focalization Impact Flowchart**
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate how focalization affects the narrative delivery and audience perception.
   - **Diagram Type:** Flowchart
   - **Elements:**
     - **Start Node:** Focalizer Definition
     - **Branches:** Different Types of Focalization (Internal, External)
     - **End Nodes:** Impacts (e.g., Emotional Engagement, Perspective Bias)

### Example Descriptions for Creating Diagrams:

#### Venn Diagram for Narrative Roles:
- **Step 1:** Draw three overlapping circles.
- **Step 2:** Label each circle: one for Narrator, one for Focalizer, and one for Actor.
- **Step 3:** In the overlap areas, list examples or conditions where these roles merge (e.g., a narrator who is also the main character and thus a focalizer).

#### Comparative Table for Narrative Forms:
- **Step 1:** Create a table with three columns.
- **Step 2:** Label each column with one of the narrative forms.
- **Step 3:** Add rows for different effects or characteristics, and fill in how each form impacts these aspects.

#### Flowchart for Focalization Impact:
- **Step 1:** Start with a box labeled "Focalizer."
- **Step 2:** Branch out into types of focalization (internal vs. external).
- **Step 3:** From each type, draw arrows leading to boxes describing the specific impacts on the narrative.

These diagrams will help you visualize the structural and functional relationships within narrative forms and roles, enhancing your understanding and making it easier to recall the concepts during discussions or examinations.
