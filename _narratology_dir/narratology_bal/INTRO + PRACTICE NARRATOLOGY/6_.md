### Detailed Summary
**This study, first published in 2000 and updated in 2011, addresses the rapid acceleration in information technology and web-based communications over the past decade. The cultural environment has transformed with the rise of iPhones, Twitter, Wikipedia, Google, Facebook, and YouTube, necessitating a reassessment of the role of intertextuality. The early twenty-first century is marked by significant global events and a pervasive culture of adaptation, appropriation, and cultural regurgitation, making Adorno’s concept of the Culture Industry particularly relevant. The nostalgia for Modernism's avant-garde forms, as discussed by Jameson, contrasts with the contemporary scene of continuous cultural recycling.**

**Adaptation studies have emerged as a new academic discipline, focusing on the intertextual relationship between various cultural forms. The formation of the International Association of Adaptation Studies and the Oxford University Press journal Adaptation highlight this development. Adaptation studies examine a wide range of cultural phenomena, including videogames, theme park rides, graphic novels, and more. This field addresses the anxiety surrounding adaptation's commercial success and explores how art creates art through intertextual processes.**

**A significant aspect of adaptation studies is its challenge to the traditional 'fidelity model' of assessing adaptations based on their faithfulness to source texts. Instead, adaptation studies recognize the intertextual nature of all texts, emphasizing the importance of cultural and social practices in selecting certain inter-texts for adaptation. Films like Charlie Kaufman’s Adaptation and Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet exemplify contemporary works that bring adaptation into question. The new digital technology in classrooms encourages an intertextual approach to studying classics, enhancing the understanding of their cultural significance through transmedia adaptations.**

**The emergence of new media technologies has transformed the way narratives and art are consumed and understood. In this environment, adaptation studies must consider the formative nature of different media and their impact on the adaptation process. Audiences are becoming adept at navigating a multi-media environment, demanding analysis of how new technologies reformulate our understanding of intertextuality and meaning-making.**

**Michael Ryan Moore's analysis of the video game Six Days in Fallujah illustrates the changing social rules around adaptation in interactive media. The contingency and choice inherent in video games differentiate them from film adaptations, highlighting the need for adaptation studies to address these new forms. Theories of intertextuality must adapt to the new media landscape, reassessing cautious responses to digital technologies and their implications for democratization and the plurality of voices.**

**Intertextual theory offers valuable insights into the new information technologies, emphasizing the need for a dialogic and inclusive approach to digital textuality. The new adaptive environment underscores the interconnectedness of texts and the evolving nature of narrative in the digital age.**

### Arguments
1. **The interconnectedness and multiplicity of digital media environments embody the theories of intertextuality articulated by poststructuralist theorists, transforming how texts are created, read, and understood.**
2. **Digital media, through the process of remediation, continuously adapt and reformat older media, demonstrating a fundamentally intertextual nature that challenges traditional notions of textuality and authorship.**
3. **Hypertexts and new media technologies decentralize the concept of the text, allowing for an active, participatory role for readers and embodying the deconstructive principles of poststructuralist theory.**

### Detailed Summary
**Since the invention of the World Wide Web (W3) in 1993, the ways we think about meaning, textuality, and the processes of reading and writing have been revolutionized. This significant shift has bridged academic theories and the design and production of new electronic and digital media forms. Lev Manovich claims that today's greatest artworks are digital media themselves, which have massively extended ideas about textuality and meaning previously articulated by avant-garde artists. He describes W3 as a great work of art due to its complexity and dynamic nature, arguing that computer scientists who developed these technologies are the truly important artists of our time.**

**Theories of intertextuality have influenced and been assimilated into this computer-dominated world where every text is connected to others, inspiring a proliferation of media devices. Jay David Bolter and Diane Gromola note that people today prefer complex media forms and engage with multiple media simultaneously, embodying the intertextual theories studied in this book. Marcel O'Gorman observes that the major tenets of deconstruction, such as the death of the Author and intertextuality, have been transformed into the materiality of new media.**

**Modern media consumers live in a hypertextual environment where theories of intertextuality are made visible through various technological media. This new media environment, with its potential for a global archive, brings to life ideas previously theorized by artists like Jorge Luis Borges and poststructuralists such as Foucault and Derrida. Public battles over projects like the Google Books Library Project highlight the ongoing conflict between knowledge and the market in this new digital context.**

**George P. Landow describes how hypertextuality makes the interconnections between texts more visible and navigable, shifting the focus and organizing principle of reading to the reader, who becomes an active participant in creating meaning. This de-centred textual experience aligns with poststructuralist resistance to transparent meaning, as hypertexts allow readers to trace the never-ending play of signification.**

**Lev Manovich compares the reader of hypertextual, de-centred texts to Robinson Crusoe, making sense of a random world. Hypertexts encourage intertextual and intratextual readings, exemplified by digital resources like the NINES and Rossetti Archive. These platforms enable readers to create and alter relationships within texts, embodying a non-linear reading experience.**

**Digital media and hypertextuality challenge traditional notions of linear narration, bounded texts, and authorial authority. The process of remediation, as discussed by Bolter and Grusin, highlights how new media constantly adapt and reformat older media, presenting themselves as innovative while engaging in a fundamentally intertextual process. This remediation underscores the continuous interplay between old and new media, reinforcing the intertextual nature of all texts and the evolving landscape of meaning-making in the digital age.**

**As we move from a print to a digital culture, the role of intertextuality must be re-evaluated to account for the transformative impact of new media technologies. Theories of intertextuality must adapt to this changing environment, considering how digital media reshape our understanding of texts, meaning, and the interconnectedness of cultural artifacts.**
