## 2.1 Structuralist Foundations

### Propositions for Vladimir Propp:

- **Proposition 1:** "The sequence of narrative functions in folktales is nearly invariable, suggesting a common structural pattern across diverse narratives."
  - **Justification:** "Vladimir Propp's analysis of folktales revealed that despite their diversity, they share a fixed sequence of functions, indicating a universal structure underlying these narratives."

- **Proposition 2:** "Propp's formalist approach focused on the internal structures and rules governing folktales, rather than their content or cultural context."
  - **Justification:** "By adopting an abstract and formalist method, Propp was able to generalize his findings across a wide range of folktales, highlighting the structural commonalities rather than the specific details of each tale."

- **Proposition 3:** "Propp's work laid the groundwork for structuralism and had a significant impact on the development of narratology."
  - **Justification:** "Propp's analysis of narrative structures influenced prominent scholars like *Claude Lévi-Strauss*, Roland Barthes, and Algirdas Julien Greimas, contributing to the establishment of narratology as a field that examines the underlying structures of narratives across various media."


## Overview

**Vladimir Propp (1895–1970)** was a Russian folklorist and scholar who made groundbreaking contributions to the study of narrative structure, particularly through his work *"Morphology of the Folktale"*. His approach to analyzing folktales laid the foundation for structuralist approaches in narratology, influencing a wide range of fields including literature, anthropology, and semiotics.

## "Morphology of the Folktale" (1928)

*"Morphology of the Folktale"* is Propp’s most influential work, where he systematically analyzed the structure of Russian folktales to uncover a universal pattern underlying their narratives. The term "**morphology**" here refers to the study of forms and structures, similar to its usage in biology.

1. **Narrative Functions:**
   - Propp identified 31 **narrative functions** or actions that constitute the fundamental building blocks of folktales. These functions occur in a specific sequence and are associated with specific roles or characters.
   - These functions form a sequence that can be found in nearly every folktale, though not all functions are always present. The sequence of these functions is what Propp referred to as the “morphology” of the folktale.

2. **Character Roles or "Archetypes of Action":**
   - Propp categorized characters into seven broad types based on their roles in the narrative. 
   - These roles are not necessarily individual characters but can represent functions or tasks fulfilled by multiple characters.

3. **Fixed Sequence of Functions:**
   - Propp argued that the sequence of narrative functions in folktales is nearly invariable, which means that despite the diversity of folktales, they share a common structural pattern.

4. **Abstract and Formalist Approach:**
   - Propp’s method was highly formalistic, focusing on the internal structures and rules governing folktales rather than their content, meaning, or cultural context. This formalist approach allowed him to generalize his findings beyond the specific Russian folktales he analyzed.

5. **Impact on Structuralism and Narratology:**
   - Propp's work is considered a precursor to structuralism, influencing scholars like Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, and Algirdas Julien Greimas. His analysis of narrative structures contributed to the development of narratology, a field that studies the structures underlying narratives in various media.


## Propp’s Other Contributions

While *"Morphology of the Folktale"* remains Propp’s most famous work, he also made significant contributions to the study of folklore and narrative structures in other works. Some of the key areas and topics of interest include:

1. **Historical Roots of Folktales:**
   - In his later work, Propp explored the historical origins of folktales, arguing that they are deeply connected to ancient rituals and social practices. He believed that understanding the historical context of these tales could reveal their original meanings and functions within society.

2. **The Russian Epic and Heroic Poetry:**
   - Propp studied Russian epics and heroic poetry, focusing on the cultural and historical significance of these narratives. He was interested in how these stories preserved and conveyed collective memory and values.

3. **Analysis of Folk Rituals:**
   - Propp extended his structural analysis to folk rituals, suggesting that the narrative structures he identified in folktales might also be applicable to understanding the structure of rituals. He explored how rituals and folktales might share common origins in human social and psychological needs.

4. **Cultural and Social Functions of Folktales:**
   - Beyond their structural aspects, Propp was interested in the role of folktales within the society that produced them. He examined how folktales served as a means of socialization, transmitting cultural norms and values to younger generations.

5. **Critique of Other Theoretical Approaches:**
   - Propp was critical of the comparative mythology approach, which sought to trace the origins of folktales to mythological archetypes. He argued that this approach neglected the specific, structural aspects of folktales and their functions within narrative.


## Topics of Interest in Propp's Other Contributions

1. **Folklore and Rituals:**
   - How Propp's analysis of folktale structures can be applied to the study of rituals and other cultural practices.
   - The connection between narrative structures and social functions in traditional societies.

2. **Comparative Folklore Studies:**
   - Propp’s critiques of comparative mythology and his advocacy for a structuralist approach to folklore.

3. **Influence on Structuralist and Post-Structuralist Theories:**
   - Propp's influence on later structuralist theories, particularly in the works of Lévi-Strauss and Barthes.
   - The impact of Propp's ideas on the development of narratology as a distinct field of study.

4. **Adaptation and Evolution of Narrative Structures:**
   - How Propp’s ideas have been adapted or critiqued in contemporary narratology, particularly in the context of non-folktale narratives, such as modern literature, film, and digital media.

## Conclusion

Vladimir Propp's *"Morphology of the Folktale"* represents a landmark in the study of narrative structure. By breaking down folktales into their constituent parts and identifying universal patterns, Propp provided a powerful tool for analyzing stories that has influenced a wide range of disciplines. His work extends beyond folktales, touching upon the cultural, social, and historical functions of narratives and rituals, making him a key figure in both folklore studies and narratology.

# Vladimir Propp's 31 Narrative Functions

Vladimir Propp identified 31 narrative functions in his seminal work *"Morphology of the Folktale"*. These functions represent the fundamental building blocks of folktale narratives and typically occur in a fixed sequence. Below is a list of these functions with their definitions:

1. **Absentation**:
   - A family member leaves the home or is otherwise absent (e.g., a parent dies or goes away, the hero departs).

2. **Interdiction**:
   - A prohibition or command is given to the hero (e.g., "Do not go into the forest").

3. **Violation of Interdiction**:
   - The interdiction is violated (e.g., the hero disobeys and goes into the forest).

4. **Reconnaissance**:
   - The villain attempts to gather information about the hero (e.g., spies on the hero, tries to find out about weaknesses).

5. **Delivery**:
   - The villain receives information about the hero (e.g., finds out where the hero lives or about a secret).

6. **Trickery**:
   - The villain attempts to deceive the hero (e.g., disguises themselves, pretends to be someone else).

7. **Complicity**:
   - The hero is deceived by the villain and unwittingly helps them (e.g., the hero believes the villain’s lies or gives away crucial information).

8. **Villainy**:
   - The villain causes harm or injury to a family member (e.g., kidnapping, theft, casting a spell).

9. **Mediation**:
   - The hero becomes aware of the villainy or a lack and is dispatched or receives a call to action (e.g., the hero is told of the loss and sets out to find a solution).

10. **Counteraction**:
    - The hero decides to act in response to the villainy or lack (e.g., prepares to embark on a quest).

11. **Departure**:
    - The hero leaves home to begin the quest (e.g., setting out on the journey).

12. **First Function of the Donor**:
    - The hero encounters a donor who tests, interrogates, or attacks the hero (e.g., the hero meets a magical helper who challenges them).

13. **Hero's Reaction**:
    - The hero responds to the actions of the donor, often passing a test or showing kindness (e.g., the hero passes the test, helps the donor, or solves a riddle).

    - The hero receives a magical agent or object as a reward (e.g., a sword, potion, or ring).

15. **Guidance**:
    - The hero is led to the whereabouts of the object of the search (e.g., the hero is shown the way to the villain's lair).

16. **Struggle**:
    - The hero and the villain engage in direct combat or a battle (e.g., a fight, a contest).

17. **Branding**:
    - The hero is marked in some way (e.g., receives a scar, brand, or some distinguishing feature).

18. **Victory**:
    - The villain is defeated (e.g., killed, captured, or driven away).

19. **Liquidation**:
    - The initial misfortune or lack is resolved (e.g., the hero rescues the victim, retrieves the stolen item, breaks the spell).

20. **Return**:
    - The hero starts the journey back home (e.g., begins the return trip).

21. **Pursuit**:
    - The hero is pursued by the villain or another antagonist (e.g., the villain chases the hero to prevent them from returning).

22. **Rescue**:
    - The hero is rescued from pursuit or a trap (e.g., is saved by a magical helper or a sudden intervention).

23. **Unrecognized Arrival**:
    - The hero returns home or to another place but is not recognized (e.g., returns in disguise, or the hero's identity is unknown).

24. **Unfounded Claims**:
    - A false hero presents unfounded claims to the success or achievements of the hero (e.g., someone else claims to have done what the hero did).

25. **Difficult Task**:

# Propp's Archetypes of Action

Vladimir Propp categorized characters in folktales into seven broad types based on their roles and functions within the narrative. These roles, or "Archetypes of Action," are essential to understanding the structure of the tale and the relationship between characters.

## The Seven Archetypes of Action

1. **The Villain**:
   - **Role**: The antagonist who opposes the hero and creates obstacles or challenges.
   - **Function**: The villain's actions drive the conflict of the story. They may cause harm, deceive, or challenge the hero, creating the central problem that the hero must overcome.

2. **The Donor**:
   - **Role**: The character who prepares the hero or provides them with a magical object or assistance.
   - **Function**: The donor tests the hero's worthiness, often through a challenge or task. If the hero passes the test, the donor rewards them with a magical item, advice, or knowledge that is crucial for the hero's success.

3. **The Helper**:
   - **Role**: The character who aids the hero in their quest.
   - **Function**: The helper provides support to the hero, often in critical moments. This assistance can come in the form of physical help, guidance, or the use of a magical object provided by the donor.

4. **The Princess (and her father)**:
   - **Role**: The sought-after person (often female) who acts as the hero's reward and/or the hero's goal.
   - **Function**: The princess is usually the object of the hero's quest, often requiring rescue from the villain. Her father, if present, often sets tasks for the hero or offers the hero a reward. The princess's hand in marriage or the father's blessing often serves as the ultimate prize for the hero's success.

5. **The Dispatcher**:
   - **Role**: The character who sends the hero on their quest.
   - **Function**: The dispatcher recognizes a lack or a problem and sends the hero on the mission to resolve it. This character initiates the hero's journey, setting the story in motion.

6. **The Hero**:
   - **Role**: The protagonist who seeks something valuable and strives to restore equilibrium.
   - **Function**: The hero is the central character around whom the story revolves. The hero takes on challenges, battles the villain, and undergoes a transformation. In the end, the hero often gains something of value, whether it be a reward, wisdom, or a new status.

7. **The False Hero**:
   - **Role**: A character who initially seems to be a hero but ultimately proves to be unworthy or deceptive.
   - **Function**: The false hero often tries to take credit for the hero's actions or seeks to usurp the hero's position. This character's duplicity is usually revealed toward the end of the story, leading to their exposure and punishment.

## Understanding the Archetypes of Action

These "Archetypes of Action" are not fixed to individual characters; instead, a single character may fulfill multiple roles throughout the narrative, or multiple characters may share a single role. Understanding these spheres helps to decipher the underlying structure of folktales and their recurring patterns.

  - **Justification:** "Propp’s influence on structuralism offers a framework for unifying various narratological approaches, allowing for the construction of a model that accounts for both the fixed patterns of narrative structures and the dynamic elements introduced by later theorists."

- **Proposition 3:** "The integration of narratological theories into a single model is facilitated by the formalist methodologies developed by Propp, which emphasize the analysis of narrative structures independent of cultural and contextual factors."
  - **Justification:** "Propp’s abstract and formalist approach allows for the identification of universal narrative functions, providing a basis for synthesizing diverse theories into a model that is both comprehensive and adaptable."

### Research Question 2: What methodological approaches are most effective in integrating diverse narrative theories?

- **Proposition 1:** "A formalist and structuralist methodology, as exemplified by Propp, is effective in integrating diverse narrative theories by focusing on the invariant structures that are common across different narratives."
  - **Justification:** "Propp’s method of identifying a fixed sequence of functions in folktales serves as a model for integrating diverse theories, offering a structured approach that can be applied to various narrative forms."

- **Proposition 2:** "Methodological approaches that prioritize the analysis of narrative functions and roles, as established by Propp, are most effective in creating a unified narratological theory."
  - **Justification:** "By focusing on the roles and functions that characters and events serve within a narrative, Propp’s approach provides a methodological foundation for integrating diverse theories, ensuring that the synthesis is grounded in the core structures of narrative."

- **Proposition 3:** "Combining Propp’s structuralist framework with more recent cognitive and cultural approaches can enhance the integration of narrative theories by bridging the gap between structural analysis and audience interpretation."
  - **Justification:** "Propp’s structuralist foundations offer a systematic approach to narrative analysis, while cognitive and cultural theories introduce additional layers of meaning, making the integration of diverse theories both rigorous and contextually sensitive."

### Research Question 3: How does this new model enhance the analysis of narrative structures and functions across different media and cultural contexts?

- **Proposition 1:** "A model that synthesizes Propp’s structuralist approach with contemporary narratological theories enhances the analysis of narrative structures across different media by providing a universal framework applicable to diverse narrative forms."
  - **Justification:** "Propp’s identification of universal narrative functions allows for the application of a consistent analytical framework across various media, while contemporary theories add flexibility and adaptability to different cultural contexts."

- **Proposition 2:** "The integration of structuralist foundations with media-specific narrative theories enables more nuanced analyses of how narrative functions are adapted across different cultural contexts."
  - **Justification:** "Propp’s work on the fixed sequence of functions offers a baseline for understanding narrative structures, while media-specific theories account for the variations introduced by different cultural and technological influences."

- **Proposition 3:** "This new model, grounded in Propp’s structuralist theory, enhances narrative analysis by offering a systematic approach that is both comprehensive in scope and adaptable to the specificities of different media and cultural contexts."
  - **Justification:** "Propp’s formalist and abstract approach provides a strong foundation for a universal model, while the inclusion of contemporary theories ensures that the model can be applied effectively to narratives across a wide range of media and cultural contexts."
