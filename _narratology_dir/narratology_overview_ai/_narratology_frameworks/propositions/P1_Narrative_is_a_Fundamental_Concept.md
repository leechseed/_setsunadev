### Propp's Validation of the Proposition 1 on Narrative Analysis

---

**Proposition 1:** 
**Narrative is a fundamental concept that exists across all fields of study, serving as a universal framework for organizing, interpreting, and communicating knowledge, experiences, and events, whether in the humanities, sciences, social sciences, or arts. This ubiquity of narrative underscores its importance in shaping understanding and facilitating discourse across diverse academic and professional disciplines.**

- **Proposition 1.1:** "The sequence of narrative functions in folktales is nearly invariable, suggesting a common structural pattern across diverse narratives."
  - **Justification:** "Vladimir Propp's analysis of folktales revealed that despite their diversity, they share a fixed sequence of functions, indicating a universal structure underlying these narratives."

- **Proposition 1.2:** "Propp's formalist approach focused on the internal structures and rules governing folktales, rather than their content or cultural context."
  - **Justification:** "By adopting an abstract and formalist method, Propp was able to generalize his findings across a wide range of folktales, highlighting the structural commonalities rather than the specific details of each tale."

- **Proposition 1.3:** "Propp's work laid the groundwork for structuralism and had a significant impact on the development of narratology."
  - **Justification:** "Propp's analysis of narrative structures influenced prominent scholars like *Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss*, Roland Barthes, and Algirdas Julien Greimas, contributing to the establishment of narratology as a field that examines the underlying structures of narratives across various media."
