# P1.2_Establishing_Meaning_in_Narratology

**Proposition:**  
- **In narratology, 'meaning' is understood as the dynamic and multi-layered interpretation of a narrative that emerges from the interaction between the narrative's structure, content, and the reader's cognitive, cultural, and emotional engagement. Meaning is not a fixed or inherent quality of the text itself, but rather a constructed and negotiated understanding that is shaped by the interplay of narrative elements, including plot, character, theme, and the reader's personal context and interpretive strategies. This conception of meaning emphasizes the active role of both the narrative and the reader in co-creating the narrative's significance and impact.**
