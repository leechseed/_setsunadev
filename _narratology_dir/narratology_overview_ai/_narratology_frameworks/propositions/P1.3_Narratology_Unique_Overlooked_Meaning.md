# P1.3_Narratology_Unique_Overlooked_Meaning

**Proposition:**  
- **Narratology plays a crucial role in shaping our comprehension and discussions by offering a specialized approach to analyzing and interpreting narratives. Unlike other disciplines, which might treat data as isolated points or context-dependent facts, narratology delves into the underlying structures and functions that give narratives their form and meaning. This approach reveals recurring patterns and themes that cut across various fields of study, enabling a more integrated and profound analysis of information. Narratologyâ€™s unique contribution lies in its ability to merge cognitive, cultural, and emotional aspects into a cohesive analysis, providing insights that are often overlooked in other areas of research. By doing so, it enhances our understanding of human experiences and promotes richer interdisciplinary conversations.**


Proposition 
Narratology and any creative field in general is in of itself an esoteric and opinionated field of study. The result is a fractured, siloed, and politicized field that, unlike more rigerous fields of study, lack any unifying theories or library of uiversally accepted truths. This lack of common ground results in a field that does not advance in a unified manner. Ultimately the field is wicked, a state in which knowledge in the field lacks any validated truths, experts, methods, or guidelines. 


The inherent wickedness of narratology and the creative arts manifests in fractured and incomplete knowledge at its best and unsubstantiated and flawed assumtions lacking any form of logical deductiveness in practicing designers, artists, and other professional craftsmen which demands more than a cursory understanding of story. This lack of understanding and common ground manifests itself in the percieved deminished quality of story and narrative in modern entertainment products. 

As technology and society advances at a rapid pace, the field of narratology stagnates behind and what results are an inferior and immature ecosystem of quality designed entertainment products. 

A lack of fundamental understanding of Narratology affects the culture of society and what results is a general public that lacks common ground or unified meaning and can result in the fracturing and collapse of society itself. 

The solution is to rebuild an elegantly designed model of narratology that can be easily disseminated to professionals to build a foundation to then develop along their discressions which then will help build meaning beyond a technical and scientific nature not only for complex products but for society itself. 

Thru this simple and shared foundational model, the field of narratology can move forward as a unified field with diversified and nuanced progression. That Model is the General Model of Narrativity. 

The solution is to create a model that is meticulous in its construction that priorities a ...efeffefef


**Proposition:**  
- **In narratology, 'meaning' is understood as the dynamic and multi-layered interpretation of a narrative that emerges from the interaction between the narrative's structure, content, and the reader's cognitive, cultural, and emotional engagement. Meaning is not a fixed or inherent quality of the text itself, but rather a constructed and negotiated understanding that is shaped by the interplay of narrative elements, including plot, character, theme, and the reader's personal context and interpretive strategies. This conception of meaning emphasizes the active role of both the narrative and the reader in co-creating the narrative's significance and impact.**
