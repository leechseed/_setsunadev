# H. Porter Abbott's Contributions to Narratology


***

### Title: **Abbott's Narrative Perspective Framework**
- **Narrative Perspective**:
  - **Definition**: H. Porter Abbott provides a thorough exploration of narrative perspective, focusing on the distinction between *who sees* (focalization) and *who speaks* (narrative voice). These two aspects are crucial for understanding how stories are told and how they shape the reader’s engagement with the narrative.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Focalization (Who Sees)**:
      - **Definition**: Focalization refers to the perspective through which the events of the narrative are perceived. It involves identifying the character or entity whose point of view shapes the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: By analyzing focalization, Abbott explores how different viewpoints can influence the reader's understanding of the story, highlighting the importance of perspective in shaping narrative meaning.
    - **Narrative Voice (Who Speaks)**:
      - **Definition**: Narrative voice refers to the entity or persona that narrates the story. It encompasses first-person, third-person, and omniscient narration, each offering different levels of insight and control over the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: Abbott’s analysis of narrative voice includes a deep dive into unreliable narrators, explaining how selective presentation of information can manipulate reader perception, creating layers of meaning and complexity within the story.

### Title: **Abbott's Narrative Gaps and Reader Involvement Framework**
- **Narrative Gaps and Reader Involvement**:
  - **Definition**: Abbott emphasizes the role of the reader in constructing the meaning of a narrative, focusing on the concept of *gaps*—moments where information is omitted or left ambiguous.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrative Gaps**:
      - **Definition**: Gaps in a narrative are deliberate omissions or ambiguities that invite the reader to actively participate in the story by filling in the missing pieces.
      - **Contextualization**: Abbott argues that these gaps are not just absences but opportunities for reader engagement. By leaving certain elements open to interpretation, narratives encourage readers to contribute to the creation of meaning, making the reading experience more interactive and dynamic.
    - **Reader Involvement**:
      - **Definition**: Reader involvement refers to the active role that readers play in interpreting and completing the narrative. It highlights the collaborative nature of storytelling, where meaning is co-created by the author and the reader.
      - **Contextualization**: This concept is central to Abbott’s approach to narratology, as it underscores the importance of the reader's agency in the narrative process. By engaging with gaps, readers become co-authors in the construction of the story, making each reading experience unique.
