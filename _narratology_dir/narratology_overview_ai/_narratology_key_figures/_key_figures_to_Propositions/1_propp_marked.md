# 1. Vladimir Propp's Contributions to Narratology

## 1.1 Overview

**Vladimir Propp (1895–1970)** was a Russian folklorist and scholar who made groundbreaking contributions to the study of narrative structure, particularly through his work *"Morphology of the Folktale"*. His approach to analyzing folktales laid the foundation for structuralist approaches in narratology, influencing fields such as literature, anthropology, and semiotics.

## 1.2 "Morphology of the Folktale" (1928)

*"Morphology of the Folktale"* is Propp’s most influential work, where he systematically analyzed the structure of Russian folktales to uncover a universal pattern underlying their narratives. The term "morphology" refers to the study of forms and structures, similar to its usage in biology.

## 1.3 Key Concepts and Contributions

### 1.3.1 Narrative Functions

- Propp identified 31 *narrative functions* that are fundamental building blocks of folktales. These functions occur in a specific sequence and are associated with specific roles or characters. For example:
  - **Initial Situation**: The story begins with a state of equilibrium.
  - **Absence**: A family member leaves or is taken away.
  - **Interdiction**: A rule or command is given.
  - **Violation of Interdiction**: The rule is broken.
  - **Villainy**: The villain causes harm.
  - **Struggle**: The hero and the villain engage in a direct battle.

- These functions form a sequence that can be found in nearly every folktale, though not all functions are always present. This sequence is what Propp referred to as the "morphology" of the folktale.

#### Context

- Propp's concept of narrative functions has been highly influential in narratology, particularly in the structural analysis of narratives. By identifying universal functions that recur in folktales, Propp provided a framework for understanding the structural elements common to many stories. His work is particularly important for the study of oral traditions and folk literature. Additionally, Propp's ideas have influenced broader narrative theory, including modern literature, film, and other storytelling forms. Analyzing how these functions manifest in various narratives offers insights into the universal structures that shape human storytelling and cultural expression.

### 1.3.2 Character Roles or "Spheres of Action"

- Propp categorized characters into seven broad types based on their roles in the narrative:
  - **The Villain**: Opposes the hero.
  - **The Donor**: Prepares the hero or gives the hero a magical object.
  - **The Helper**: Assists the hero in the quest.
  - **The Princess (and her father)**: The hero's reward, often sought after during the quest.
  - **The Dispatcher**: Sends the hero on the mission.
  - **The Hero**: Protagonist who seeks something valuable.
  - **The False Hero**: Takes credit for the hero's actions or tries to marry the princess without deserving it.

- These roles represent functions or tasks that can be fulfilled by multiple characters.

#### Context

- Propp's identification of these character roles was a major contribution to narratology, particularly in understanding the structure of folktales. By categorizing characters based on their functions, Propp demonstrated that narratives could be understood as systems of roles that interact in predictable ways. This structuralist approach laid the groundwork for further studies in narrative theory, influencing modern storytelling in literature, film, and other media. Propp's work is foundational in exploring how characters drive the plot and how their interactions create the narrative's progression.

### 1.3.3 Fixed Sequence of Functions

- Propp argued that the sequence of narrative functions in folktales is nearly invariable, meaning that despite the diversity of folktales, they share a common structural pattern.

#### Context

- The concept of a fixed sequence of functions is a key element in Propp's structural analysis of folktales. This idea has had a significant impact on narratology, particularly in studying narrative structures and patterns. By showing that diverse stories share the same underlying sequence of functions, Propp's work supports the structuralist view that human narratives are governed by universal cognitive structures. This insight has influenced the analysis of folktales, literature, film, and other forms of storytelling.

### 1.3.4 Abstract and Formalist Approach

- Propp’s method was highly formalistic, focusing on the internal structures and rules governing folktales rather than their content, meaning, or cultural context. This approach allowed him to generalize his findings beyond the specific Russian folktales he analyzed.

#### Context

- Propp’s formalist approach shifted the focus from the content and cultural significance of folktales to their underlying structural patterns. This method was influential in the development of structuralism, a theoretical framework that seeks to understand human culture through its underlying structures. Propp's work demonstrated that narratives could be studied as systems governed by internal rules and patterns, independent of their specific cultural or historical contexts. This approach has had a lasting impact on narratology, literary theory, and folklore studies.

### 1.3.5 Impact on Structuralism and Narratology

- Propp's work is considered a precursor to structuralism, influencing scholars like Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, and Algirdas Julien Greimas. His analysis of narrative structures contributed to developing narratology, a field that studies the structures underlying narratives in various media.

#### Context

- Propp’s methodologies have been adapted and expanded by subsequent scholars, particularly within structuralism. His work provided a clear example of how narratives could be deconstructed into basic units that reveal deeper, universal patterns. This method of analysis has become central to narratology, where scholars continue to explore the fundamental structures that shape narratives across cultures and media. Propp’s legacy is intertwined with the development of these fields, positioning him as a pivotal figure in the study of narrative theory and cultural analysis.

## 1.4 Propp’s Other Contributions

While *"Morphology of the Folktale"* remains Propp’s most famous work, he also made significant contributions to the study of folklore and narrative structures in other works. Some key areas and topics of interest include:

### 1.4.1 Historical Roots of Folktales

- Propp explored the historical origins of folktales, arguing that they are deeply connected to ancient rituals and social practices. He believed that understanding the historical context of these tales could reveal their original meanings and functions within society.

### 1.4.2 The Russian Epic and Heroic Poetry

- Propp studied Russian epics and heroic poetry, focusing on the cultural and historical significance of these narratives. He was interested in how these stories preserved and conveyed collective memory and values.

### 1.4.3 Analysis of Folk Rituals

- Propp extended his structural analysis to folk rituals, suggesting that the narrative structures he identified in folktales might also be applicable to understanding the structure of rituals. He explored how rituals and folktales might share common origins in human social and psychological needs.

### 1.4.4 Cultural and Social Functions of Folktales

- Beyond their structural aspects, Propp was interested in the role of folktales within the society that produced them. He examined how folktales served as a means of socialization, transmitting cultural norms and values to younger generations.

### 1.4.5 Critique of Other Theoretical Approaches

- Propp was critical of the comparative mythology approach, which sought to trace the origins of folktales to mythological archetypes. He argued that this approach neglected the specific, structural aspects of folktales and their functions within narrative.

## 1.5 Topics of Interest in Propp's Other Contributions

### 1.5.1 Folklore and Rituals

- How Propp's analysis of folktale structures can be applied to the study of rituals and other cultural practices.
- The connection between narrative structures and social functions in traditional societies.

### 1.5.2 Comparative Folklore Studies

- Propp’s critiques of comparative mythology and his advocacy for a structuralist approach to folklore.

### 1.5.3 Influence on Structuralist and Post-Structuralist Theories

- Propp's influence on later structuralist theories, particularly in the works of Lévi-Strauss and Barthes.
- The impact of Propp's ideas on the development of narratology as a distinct field of study.

### 1.5.4 Adaptation and Evolution of Narrative Structures

- How Propp’s ideas have been adapted or critiqued in contemporary narratology, particularly in the context of non-folktale narratives, such as modern literature, film, and digital media.

## 1.6 Conclusion

Vladimir Propp's *"Morphology of the Folktale"* represents a landmark in the study of narrative structure. By breaking down folktales into their constituent parts and identifying universal patterns, Propp provided a powerful tool for analyzing stories that have influenced a wide range of disciplines. His work extends beyond folktales, touching upon the cultural, social, and historical functions of narratives and rituals, making him a key figure in both folklore studies and narratology.
y in the structural analysis of narratives. By identifying a set of universal functions that recur in folktales, Propp provided a framework for understanding the common structural elements that underlie many different stories. His work is particularly important for the study of oral traditions and folk literature, where these narrative patterns are often most clearly observed. Additionally, Propp's ideas have influenced broader narrative theory, including the study of modern literature, film, and other forms of storytelling. By analyzing how these functions manifest in various narratives, scholars can gain insights into the universal structures that shape human storytelling and cultural expression.

### 1.3.2 Character Roles or "Spheres of Action"
   - Propp categorized characters into seven broad types based on their roles in the narrative:
     - **The Villain**: Opposes the hero.
     - **The Donor**: Prepares the hero or gives the hero some magical object.
     - **The Helper**: Assists the hero in the quest.
     - **The Princess (and her father)**: The hero's reward, often sought after during the quest.
     - **The Dispatcher**: Sends the hero on the mission.
     - **The Hero**: Protagonist who seeks something valuable.
     - **The False Hero**: Takes credit for the hero's actions or tries to marry the princess without deserving it.
   - These roles are not necessarily individual characters but can represent functions or tasks fulfilled by multiple characters.

#### Definition

- **Character roles**: Categories of characters identified by Vladimir Propp in his analysis of folktales. These roles define the functions that characters play within the narrative structure, each contributing to the progression of the story.

#### Explanation

- Propp identified seven distinct character roles or "spheres of action" that recur across various folktales. These roles are not limited to single characters but represent functions that can be fulfilled by one or more characters within the narrative. The seven roles are:
     - **The Villain:** The antagonist who opposes the hero and creates obstacles.
     - **The Donor:** A character who prepares the hero or provides the hero with a magical object necessary for success in the quest.
     - **The Helper:** An ally who assists the hero throughout the journey, often providing support or guidance.
     - **The Princess (and her father):** The reward for the hero's success, often symbolized by marriage; the princess's father may also play a role in bestowing this reward.
     - **The Dispatcher:** The character who sends the hero on their quest, often providing the initial motivation or directive.
     - **The Hero:** The protagonist who embarks on a quest, faces challenges, and seeks something valuable or important.
     - **The False Hero:** A character who takes credit for the hero’s achievements or attempts to usurp the hero's position, often trying to marry the princess without deserving it.
   - These roles highlight the functional nature of characters in narrative, where their importance lies not in their individual personalities but in the roles they play within the story's structure.

#### Context

- Propp's identification of these character roles was a major contribution to the study of narratology, particularly in understanding the structure of folktales. By categorizing characters based on their functions, Propp demonstrated that narratives could be understood as systems of roles that interact in predictable ways. This structuralist approach laid the groundwork for further studies in narrative theory, influencing not just the analysis of folktales but also modern storytelling in literature, film, and other media. Propp's work is foundational in exploring how characters drive the plot and how their interactions create the narrative's progression.

### 1.3.3 Fixed Sequence of Functions
   - Propp argued that the sequence of narrative functions in folktales is nearly invariable, which means that despite the diversity of folktales, they share a common structural pattern.

#### Definition

- **Fixed sequence of functions**: The idea proposed by Vladimir Propp that the order in which narrative functions occur in folktales is almost always consistent, regardless of the specific details of the story. This suggests that folktales across different cultures and contexts share a common structural pattern.

#### Explanation

- Propp identified 31 narrative functions that typically occur in a specific sequence within folktales. He argued that, while not every function appears in every tale, those that do appear follow a nearly invariable order. This fixed sequence of functions provides a structural framework that can be observed across a wide variety of folktales. For example, the story might begin with an initial situation, followed by the absence of a family member, an interdiction or prohibition, a violation of that interdiction, and so on. This sequence creates a predictable pattern that guides the progression of the narrative from beginning to end, regardless of the specific characters, settings, or cultural contexts involved. Propp’s identification of this fixed sequence challenged the notion that folktales were randomly organized or purely cultural artifacts, instead revealing an underlying universal structure.

#### Context

- The concept of a fixed sequence of functions is a key element in Propp's structural analysis of folktales, as presented in his seminal work *"Morphology of the Folktale."* This idea has had a significant impact on the field of narratology, particularly in the study of narrative structures and patterns. By showing that diverse stories can share the same underlying sequence of functions, Propp's work supports the structuralist view that human narratives are governed by universal cognitive structures. This insight has been influential not only in the analysis of folktales but also in broader narrative theory, where similar structural patterns have been identified in literature, film, and other forms of storytelling.

### 1.3.4 Abstract and Formalist Approach
   - Propp’s method was highly formalistic, focusing on the internal structures and rules governing folktales rather than their content, meaning, or cultural context. This formalist approach allowed him to generalize his findings beyond the specific Russian folktales he analyzed.

#### Definition

- **Abstract and formalist approach**: Vladimir Propp’s method of analyzing folktales by focusing on their internal structures and the rules that govern them, rather than on their specific content, meaning, or cultural context.

#### Explanation

- Propp's method was rooted in {== Formalism ==}{>> Define <<}, a school of thought in literary theory that emphasizes the form and structure of a text over its content or cultural significance. In his analysis of Russian folktales, Propp concentrated on identifying and cataloging the functions that constitute the narrative structure, disregarding the specific details, characters, or cultural elements of each story. By abstracting these narrative functions and analyzing their sequence and roles, Propp was able to identify universal patterns that could be applied to folktales from various cultures, not just the Russian ones he studied. This formalist approach allowed him to create a generalized model of folktale structure—his "morphology"—which could be used to analyze and compare stories across different cultural contexts. 

#### Context

- Propp’s abstract and formalist approach was innovative in that it shifted the focus from the content and cultural significance of folktales to their underlying structural patterns. This method was particularly influential in the development of {== Structuralism ==}{>> definition <<}, a broader theoretical framework that seeks to understand human culture through its underlying structures. By focusing on the form rather than the content, Propp's work demonstrated that narratives could be studied as systems governed by internal rules and patterns, independent of their specific cultural or historical contexts. This approach has had a lasting impact on the fields of narratology, literary theory, and folklore studies, providing a foundation for the systematic analysis of narratives across different cultures and genres.

### 1.3.5 Impact on Structuralism and Narratology
   - Propp's work is considered a precursor to structuralism, influencing scholars like {== Claude Levi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, and Algirdas Julien Greimas ==}{>> relevant scholars <<}. His analysis of narrative structures contributed to the development of narratology, a field that studies the structures underlying narratives in various media.

#### Definition

- **Impact on structuralism and narratology**: Propp's work on the structure of folktales is widely regarded as a precursor to structuralism, a theoretical framework that analyzes cultural phenomena by identifying the underlying structures that govern them. His contributions have also significantly influenced the field of narratology, which focuses on the study of narrative structures across various forms of media.

#### Explanation

- Vladimir Propp’s analysis of the functions and sequences in folktales laid the groundwork for the structuralist movement, which seeks to understand culture through the patterns and structures that underlie it. Propp’s identification of consistent narrative functions and their fixed sequences in folktales provided a model for analyzing narratives in a way that emphasized their structural elements over their individual content. This approach was foundational for later structuralists like Claude Lévi-Strauss, who applied similar methods to the study of myths, and Roland Barthes, who explored the structures of literary and cultural texts. Additionally, Algirdas Julien Greimas expanded on Propp’s ideas by developing the actantial model, a tool used to analyze the roles and relationships of characters within a narrative. Propp’s work not only influenced these key figures but also contributed to the establishment of narratology as a distinct field of study. Narratology examines the ways in which narratives are structured and how these structures function across different media, including literature, film, and digital storytelling.

#### Context

- Propp’s influence on structuralism and narratology is evident in the way his methodologies have been adapted and expanded upon by subsequent scholars. Structuralism, with its focus on the underlying rules and systems that govern cultural phenomena, found a natural ally in Propp’s formalist approach to folktales. His work provided a clear example of how narratives could be deconstructed into basic units that reveal deeper, universal patterns. This method of analysis has become central to narratology, where scholars continue to explore the fundamental structures that shape narratives across cultures and media. Propp’s legacy is thus intertwined with the development of these fields, positioning him as a pivotal figure in the study of narrative theory and cultural analysis.

# 2. Vladimir Propp's 31 Narrative Functions

Vladimir Propp identified 31 narrative functions in his seminal work *"Morphology of the Folktale"*. These functions represent the fundamental building blocks of folktale narratives and typically occur in a fixed sequence. Below is a list of these functions with their definitions:

1. **Absentation**:
   - A family member leaves the home or is otherwise absent (e.g., a parent dies or goes away, the hero departs).

2. **Interdiction**:
   - A prohibition or command is given to the hero (e.g., "Do not go into the forest").

3. **Violation of Interdiction**:
   - The interdiction is violated (e.g., the hero disobeys and goes into the forest).

4. **Reconnaissance**:
   - The villain attempts to gather information about the hero (e.g., spies on the hero, tries to find out about weaknesses).

5. **Delivery**:
   - The villain receives information about the hero (e.g., finds out where the hero lives or about a secret).

6. **Trickery**:
   - The villain attempts to deceive the hero (e.g., disguises themselves, pretends to be someone else).

7. **Complicity**:
   - The hero is deceived by the villain and unwittingly helps them (e.g., the hero believes the villain’s lies or gives away crucial information).

8. **Villainy**:
   - The villain causes harm or injury to a family member (e.g., kidnapping, theft, casting a spell).

9. **Mediation**:
   - The hero becomes aware of the villainy or a lack and is dispatched or receives a call to action (e.g., the hero is told of the loss and sets out to find a solution).

10. **Counteraction**:
    - The hero decides to act in response to the villainy or lack (e.g., prepares to embark on a quest).

11. **Departure**:
    - The hero leaves home to begin the quest (e.g., setting out on the journey).

12. **First Function of the Donor**:
    - The hero encounters a donor who tests, interrogates, or attacks the hero (e.g., the hero meets a magical helper who challenges them).

13. **Hero's Reaction**:
    - The hero responds to the actions of the donor, often passing a test or showing kindness (e.g., the hero passes the test, helps the donor, or solves a riddle).

14. **Acquisition**:
    - The hero receives a magical agent or object as a reward (e.g., a sword, potion, or ring).

15. **Guidance**:
    - The hero is led to the whereabouts of the object of the search (e.g., the hero is shown the way to the villain's lair).

    - The hero is pursued by the villain or another antagonist (e.g., the villain chases the hero to prevent them from returning).

22. **Rescue**:
    - The hero is rescued from pursuit or a trap (e.g., is saved by a magical helper or a sudden intervention).

23. **Unrecognized Arrival**:
    - The hero returns home or to another place but is not recognized (e.g., returns in disguise, or the hero's identity is unknown).

24. **Unfounded Claims**:
    - A false hero presents unfounded claims to the success or achievements of the hero (e.g., someone else claims to have done what the hero did).

25. **Difficult Task**:
    - A difficult task is proposed to the hero (e.g., a final test or challenge to prove worth).

# 3. Propp's Spheres of Action

Vladimir Propp categorized characters in folktales into seven broad types based on their roles and functions within the narrative. These roles, or "Spheres of Action," are essential to understanding the structure of the tale and the relationship between characters.

## 3.1 The Seven Spheres of Action

1. **The Villain**:
   - **Role**: The antagonist who opposes the hero and creates obstacles or challenges.
   - **Function**: The villain's actions drive the conflict of the story. They may cause harm, deceive, or challenge the hero, creating the central problem that the hero must overcome.

2. **The Donor**:
   - **Role**: The character who prepares the hero or provides them with a magical object or assistance.
   - **Function**: The donor tests the hero's worthiness, often through a challenge or task. If the hero passes the test, the donor rewards them with a magical item, advice, or knowledge that is crucial for the hero's success.

3. **The Helper**:
   - **Role**: The character who aids the hero in their quest.
   - **Function**: The helper provides support to the hero, often in critical moments. This assistance can come in the form of physical help, guidance, or the use of a magical object provided by the donor.

4. **The Princess (and her father)**:
   - **Role**: The sought-after person (often female) who acts as the hero's reward and/or the hero's goal.
   - **Function**: The princess is usually the object of the hero's quest, often requiring rescue from the villain. Her father, if present, often sets tasks for the hero or offers the hero a reward. The princess's hand in marriage or the father's blessing often serves as the ultimate prize for the hero's success.

5. **The Dispatcher**:
   - **Role**: The character who sends the hero on their quest.
   - **Function**: The dispatcher recognizes a lack or a problem and sends the hero on the mission to resolve it. This character initiates the hero's journey, setting the story in motion.

6. **The Hero**:
   - **Role**: The protagonist who seeks something valuable and strives to restore equilibrium.
   - **Function**: The hero is the central character around whom the story revolves. The hero takes on challenges, battles the villain, and undergoes a transformation. In the end, the hero often gains something of value, whether it be a reward, wisdom, or a new status.

7. **The False Hero**:
   - **Role**: A character who initially seems to be a hero but ultimately proves to be unworthy or deceptive.
   - **Function**: The false hero often tries to take credit for the hero's actions or seeks to usurp the hero's position. This character's duplicity is usually revealed toward the end of the story, leading to their exposure and punishment.

## 3.2 Understanding the Spheres of Action

These "Spheres of Action" are not fixed to individual characters; instead, a single character may fulfill multiple roles throughout the narrative, or multiple characters may share a single role. Understanding these spheres helps to decipher the underlying structure of folktales and their recurring patterns.

# Propp's Contribution to General Theory of Narratology
- Formalism
- Structuralism 

## Models
- Propp's 31 Narrative Functions
- Propp's 7 Character Archetypes of Action 


> **PROPOSITION**: Propp’s identification of consistent narrative functions and their fixed sequences in folktales provided a model for analyzing narratives in a way that emphasized their structural elements over their individual content.

## 2.1 Structuralist Foundations
The foundational work of structuralists such as Vladimir Propp, Gérard Genette, and Seymour Chatman laid the groundwork for narratology by systematically categorizing narrative elements and structures. Propp’s morphology of folktales, Genette’s narrative discourse, and Chatman’s distinction between story and discourse provided essential tools for narrative analysis.


Use the data to provided to validate the proposition that narrative functions across mediums and academic fields and Narratology can function as a standardized model than can be applied intertextually across mediums and academic fields.

### Propp's Validation of the Proposition 1 on Narrative Analysis

---

**Proposition 1:** 
**Narrative is a fundamental concept that exists across all fields of study, serving as a universal framework for organizing, interpreting, and communicating knowledge, experiences, and events, whether in the humanities, sciences, social sciences, or arts. This ubiquity of narrative underscores its importance in shaping understanding and facilitating discourse across diverse academic and professional disciplines.**

- **Proposition 1.1:** "The sequence of narrative functions in folktales is nearly invariable, suggesting a common structural pattern across diverse narratives."
  - **Justification:** "Vladimir Propp's analysis of folktales revealed that despite their diversity, they share a fixed sequence of functions, indicating a universal structure underlying these narratives."

- **Proposition 1.2:** "Propp's formalist approach focused on the internal structures and rules governing folktales, rather than their content or cultural context."
  - **Justification:** "By adopting an abstract and formalist method, Propp was able to generalize his findings across a wide range of folktales, highlighting the structural commonalities rather than the specific details of each tale."

- **Proposition 1.3:** "Propp's work laid the groundwork for structuralism and had a significant impact on the development of narratology."
  - **Justification:** "Propp's analysis of narrative structures influenced prominent scholars like *Claude Lévi-Strauss*, Roland Barthes, and Algirdas Julien Greimas, contributing to the establishment of narratology as a field that examines the underlying structures of narratives across various media."


---

### Propp's Validation of the Proposition 3 on Narrative Analysis

---

**Proposition 3:**
- **Analyzing narratives across intertextual fields uncovers universal structures, enhances cultural and social insights, and drives innovation and problem-solving across disciplines.**

---

- **Proposition 3.1:** "Narratives, regardless of cultural origin, share a common structural framework that can be analyzed using a standardized model."
  - **Justification:** "Propp's identification of 31 narrative functions and a fixed sequence of events in folktales demonstrates that these stories, despite their cultural differences, follow a universal structure, validating the applicability of a standardized narrative model across different fields and mediums."

- **Proposition 3.2:** "Narrative structures consistently transmit cultural values, norms, and social functions, reflecting and shaping societal contexts."
  - **Justification:** "Propp's analysis of folktales revealed that their consistent narrative structures play a crucial role in conveying cultural and social insights. By applying Propp’s framework, researchers can uncover the embedded cultural significance within narratives, enhancing our understanding of how stories influence and reflect society."

- **Proposition 3.3:** "Propp’s structural approach fosters innovation and problem-solving across various disciplines through the analysis and creation of narratives."
  - **Justification:** "Propp’s model has been adapted in literature, film, anthropology, and even AI, driving innovation in storytelling techniques and interdisciplinary connections. This structural approach provides tools for understanding complex social and cognitive phenomena, supporting the idea that narrative analysis can lead to problem-solving and advancements across multiple fields."
