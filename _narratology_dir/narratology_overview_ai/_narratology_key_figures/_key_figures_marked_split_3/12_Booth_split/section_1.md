### Title: **Booth's Implied Author Model**
- **Implied Author**:
  - **Definition**: One of Wayne C. Booth’s most significant contributions is the concept of the *implied author*. The implied author is distinct from the real author (the actual person who wrote the text) and the narrator (the voice telling the story). It represents the version of the author that the reader constructs based on the narrative’s tone, style, and ethical stance.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Constructed Author**:
      - **Definition**: The implied author is the persona that emerges from the narrative, reflecting the values, attitudes, and intentions perceived by the reader. It is not necessarily identical to the real author but is a figure inferred from the text itself.
      - **Contextualization**: This concept allows for a more nuanced understanding of how narratives convey meaning and ethical values. By analyzing the implied author, readers can discern the underlying moral framework of the narrative and better understand the choices made in the storytelling process.
