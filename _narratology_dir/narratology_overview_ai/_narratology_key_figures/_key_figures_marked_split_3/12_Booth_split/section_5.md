### Title: **Booth's Reader's Role Framework**
- **The Reader’s Role**:
  - **Definition**: Booth emphasizes the active role of the reader in constructing meaning from a narrative. He argues that reading is a collaborative process between the author (through the implied author) and the reader, where meaning is negotiated through the reader’s interpretation of the text.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Collaborative Interpretation**:
      - **Definition**: The reader is not a passive recipient of the narrative but an active participant who brings their own experiences, values, and expectations to the reading process.
      - **Contextualization**: Booth’s framework highlights the dynamic interaction between text and reader, where meaning is not fixed but emerges from the interplay between what the author offers and what the reader perceives. This approach anticipates later developments in reader-response theory.
