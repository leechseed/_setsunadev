### Title: **Ryan's Immersion Framework**
- **Immersion**:
  - **Definition**: Marie-Laure Ryan defines *immersion* as the experience of being transported into a fictional world, where the reader or viewer becomes fully absorbed in the narrative. In her work *"Narrative as Virtual Reality,"* she explores how different media—literature, film, video games, and virtual reality—create immersive experiences.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Traditional vs. Digital Narratives**:
      - **Definition**: Ryan argues that while traditional narratives rely on the reader’s imagination to create immersion, digital and virtual narratives can achieve this effect through sensory engagement and interactivity.
      - **Contextualization**: This framework helps to understand how various media create different levels of immersion, with digital and interactive media offering new ways to engage audiences deeply within fictional worlds.
