### Title: **Bakhtin's Polyphony Framework**
- **Polyphony**:
  - **Definition**: Polyphony, or the presence of multiple independent voices within a text, is another key concept in Bakhtin’s work. In a polyphonic novel, characters’ voices are not merely subordinated to the author’s perspective but are given equal weight and autonomy.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Independent Voices**:
      - **Definition**: This creates a narrative in which different viewpoints coexist and interact, without being resolved into a single, authoritative perspective.
      - **Contextualization**: Bakhtin’s analysis of Fyodor Dostoevsky’s novels is a prime example of polyphonic narrative, where the characters’ voices engage in a complex dialogue with one another and with the reader, creating a richly textured and dynamic story.
