### Title: **Sternberg's Expositional Modes Framework**
- **Expositional Modes**:
  - **Definition**: Meir Sternberg identifies various *expositional modes* that authors use to present information to the reader, each serving different narrative functions and influencing how the story is understood.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Direct Exposition**:
      - **Definition**: Information is presented straightforwardly, with minimal delay, often used to provide essential background, context, or character details necessary for understanding the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Direct exposition is typically employed when the author wants to quickly establish the setting, context, or motivations without creating suspense. It helps to orient the reader and ensure they have the foundational knowledge needed to follow the narrative.
    - **Delayed Exposition**:
      - **Definition**: Information is withheld or gradually revealed over the course of the narrative, used to build suspense, create mysteries, or enhance the impact of eventual revelations.
      - **Contextualization**: Delayed exposition engages the reader by creating a sense of anticipation, as the withheld information becomes a focal point of interest, driving the reader’s curiosity and investment in the narrative’s outcome.
    - **Suspended Exposition**:
      - **Definition**: Certain details are withheld until they are absolutely necessary for the story’s progression. This mode is closely related to the narrative strategies of surprise and suspense, playing with the reader’s expectations and curiosity.
      - **Contextualization**: Suspended exposition is a powerful tool for controlling the narrative’s pacing and the reader’s emotional responses, strategically revealing critical information at key moments to maximize its impact.
