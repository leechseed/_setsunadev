# Boris Tomashevsky's Contributions to Narratology

## Overview

**Boris Tomashevsky (1890–1957)** was a prominent Russian literary scholar and a key figure in the Russian Formalist movement. His work laid the foundation for many concepts in literary theory, particularly in the analysis of narrative structure and poetics. Tomashevsky's contributions to narratology are closely tied to his involvement in Russian Formalism, a movement that sought to analyze literature through its formal elements rather than its content or historical context. One of his most influential works is *"Thematics,"* which focuses on the analysis of narrative content and its role within the structure of literary works.

## "Thematics" (1925)

*"Thematics"* is one of Boris Tomashevsky’s significant contributions to narratology and literary theory. In this work, he examines the role of thematic content in narrative structures, analyzing how themes function within the broader context of literary form. His approach is grounded in the principles of Russian Formalism, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between the content (what is narrated) and the form (how it is narrated).

### Key Concepts and Contributions

1. **Theme and Motif**:
   - Tomashevsky distinguishes between *theme* and *motif*, two crucial components of narrative content:
     - **Theme**: The overarching idea or subject matter of the narrative. The theme is what the story is fundamentally about, encompassing its main ideas and messages.
     - **Motif**: The recurring elements within a narrative that contribute to the development of the theme. Motifs can be objects, phrases, situations, or actions that appear repeatedly throughout the text, reinforcing the theme and providing coherence to the narrative.

2. **Plot vs. Story**:
   - Building on the work of Vladimir Propp and other Formalists, Tomashevsky makes a clear distinction between *fabula* (story) and *sjuzhet* (plot):
     - **Fabula**: The chronological sequence of events as they occur in the world of the narrative.
     - **Sjuzhet**: The way these events are arranged and presented in the narrative. Tomashevsky emphasizes that the sjuzhet is an artistic construct, designed to create specific effects and manipulate the reader’s perception.

3. **Narrative Functions**:
   - Tomashevsky’s analysis of narrative functions focuses on the role that different elements of the narrative play in advancing the plot and developing the theme. He categorizes these functions into two types:
     - **Bound Motifs**: Essential to the progression of the narrative, these motifs are necessary for the development of the plot.
     - **Free Motifs**: These motifs are not essential to the plot but contribute to the atmosphere, characterization, or thematic depth of the narrative.

4. **The Role of the Reader**:
   - Tomashevsky explores how the arrangement of themes and motifs influences the reader’s interpretation of the narrative. He argues that the sjuzhet is constructed to guide the reader’s attention and create particular effects, such as suspense, surprise, or emotional engagement. The reader's role is active, as they piece together the narrative from the clues provided by the sjuzhet.

5. **Thematics and Poetics**:
   - Tomashevsky integrates his analysis of thematics into the broader study of poetics, the formal analysis of literary texts. He views thematics as a critical component of poetics, essential for understanding how narratives function as artistic constructs. His work emphasizes the importance of studying the interaction between theme, motif, and narrative structure to grasp the full impact of a literary work.

## Contributions to Russian Formalism

Boris Tomashevsky was a central figure in the Russian Formalist movement, which sought to shift the focus of literary analysis from content and historical context to the formal properties of texts. His work contributed to several key ideas within this movement:

1. **Defamiliarization (Ostranenie)**:
   - Tomashevsky contributed to the concept of defamiliarization, originally introduced by Viktor Shklovsky. Defamiliarization refers to the technique of presenting common objects or events in an unfamiliar way to make the reader perceive them differently. Tomashevsky explored how narrative structure and thematic elements could be used to achieve defamiliarization in literature.

2. **Literary Evolution**:
   - Tomashevsky was interested in the evolution of literary forms and genres. He examined how themes and motifs evolve over time, adapting to new literary contexts and cultural changes. His work on literary evolution influenced later studies on the history of literature and the development of narrative forms.

3. **The Autonomy of Art**:
   - A key principle of Russian Formalism, and one that Tomashevsky supported, is the idea that literary texts should be analyzed as autonomous entities, independent of external factors like the author’s biography or historical background. This principle guided Tomashevsky’s approach to thematics and poetics, focusing on the internal structures of the text.

4. **Function of Literature**:
   - Tomashevsky also explored the social function of literature, particularly how themes and narratives reflect or challenge societal norms. While maintaining the Formalist emphasis on form, he acknowledged that literature has a role in shaping and reflecting cultural values.

## Topics of Interest in Tomashevsky’s Other Contributions

Beyond *"Thematics"* and his role in Russian Formalism, Tomashevsky made contributions to other areas of literary theory and criticism:

1. **Metrics and Verse Theory**:
   - Tomashevsky conducted significant work in the field of metrics and verse theory, analyzing the formal properties of poetry. His studies on rhythm, rhyme, and meter contributed to a deeper understanding of how poetic form influences meaning and aesthetic effect.

2. **Literary History**:
   - Tomashevsky was involved in the study of literary history, particularly the historical development of Russian literature. His work often intersected with his Formalist ideas, as he examined how literary forms and themes evolved over time.

3. **Narrative Devices**:
   - In addition to his work on thematics, Tomashevsky studied various narrative devices, such as the use of irony, allegory, and symbolism in literature. His analysis of these devices contributed to a broader understanding of how narrative techniques shape the reader’s experience.

4. **Editing and Anthologies**:
   - Tomashevsky was also active as an editor, compiling and editing anthologies of Russian literature. His editorial work helped to disseminate Formalist ideas and brought attention to lesser-known works and authors.

## Conclusion

Boris Tomashevsky’s *"Thematics"* is a key text in the study of narratology, offering a detailed analysis of how themes and motifs function within narrative structures. His contributions to Russian Formalism, particularly in the areas of plot structure, narrative functions, and the role of the reader, have had a lasting impact on literary theory. Beyond his work on thematics, Tomashevsky’s research on metrics, literary history, and narrative devices further solidifies his place as a central figure in 20th-century literary scholarship.
