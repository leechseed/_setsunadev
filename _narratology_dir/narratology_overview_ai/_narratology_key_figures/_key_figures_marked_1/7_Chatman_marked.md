# Seymour Chatman's Contributions to Narratology

## Overview

**Seymour Chatman (1928–2015)** was an American literary theorist, film scholar, and narratologist whose work has had a significant influence on the study of narrative structure in both literature and film. His interdisciplinary approach bridges the gap between literary theory and film studies, offering tools and frameworks for analyzing narrative across different media. Chatman is best known for his works *"Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film"* and *"Coming to Terms: The Rhetoric of Narrative in Fiction and Film,"* where he explores the intricate mechanics of storytelling and narrative discourse.

## "Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film" (1978)

*"Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film"* is one of Chatman’s most influential works, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing the structure of narratives across different media. In this book, Chatman builds on the structuralist theories of Gérard Genette, Roland Barthes, and others, but expands them to include film as well as literary texts. His analysis focuses on the distinction between story (what is told) and discourse (how it is told), a fundamental dichotomy in narratology.

### Key Concepts and Contributions

1. **Story vs. Discourse**:
   - Chatman distinguishes between *story* (the content or chain of events that make up the narrative) and *discourse* (the expression or means through which the story is conveyed). This distinction is crucial for understanding how narratives function in both literature and film:
     - **Story**: Involves the events, characters, settings, and actions that constitute the narrative. It is the raw material of the narrative, existing independently of how it is presented.
     - **Discourse**: Refers to the structure and technique of how the story is told, including the narrative voice, focalization, style, and the medium used (e.g., text, film).

2. **Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film**:
   - Chatman applies his framework to both literary and cinematic narratives, exploring the unique ways in which each medium constructs stories. He argues that while both literature and film share fundamental narrative structures, the specific techniques used in each medium differ significantly. For example, film relies heavily on visual and auditory cues, while literature depends on linguistic devices.

3. **Narrative Communication**:
   - {== elaborate ==}{>> comment <<} Chatman introduces the model of narrative communication, which includes the *real author*, *implied author*, *narrator*, *narratee*, *implied reader*, and *real reader*. This model highlights the complex relationships between the various agents involved in the creation and reception of a narrative. The concept of the *implied author*, in particular, has been influential in subsequent narratological studies.

4. **Character and Event**:
   - {== elaborate ==}{>> comment <<} In *"Story and Discourse,"* Chatman provides a detailed analysis of characters and events as narrative components. He categorizes characters as either *kernel* or *satellite* characters, with kernel characters being essential to the progression of the plot and satellite characters serving supplementary roles. Similarly, he distinguishes between *kernels* (major plot events) and *satellites* (minor events) in the story.

5. **Time and Space in Narrative**:
   -  {== elaborate ==}{>> comment <<}Chatman explores the manipulation of time and space in narrative discourse, including techniques such as *flashbacks*, *flashforwards*, *ellipsis*, and *summary*. He examines how both literary and cinematic narratives use these techniques to shape the audience's perception of the story.

## "Coming to Terms: The Rhetoric of Narrative in Fiction and Film" (1990)

*"Coming to Terms: The Rhetoric of Narrative in Fiction and Film"* builds on the ideas presented in *"Story and Discourse,"* further exploring the rhetoric of narrative and the ways in which narratives persuade and engage their audiences. In this work, Chatman delves deeper into the techniques of narrative construction and the effects these techniques have on interpretation.

### Key Concepts and Contributions

1. **Narrative Rhetoric**:
   - Chatman examines the rhetorical strategies used in narrative to influence the reader or viewer. He argues that narratives are not neutral; they are crafted to produce specific effects, emotions, and interpretations. This rhetoric of narrative involves the careful selection of narrative techniques to achieve the desired impact on the audience.

2. **Narrative Voice and Focalization**:
   - {== elaborate ==}{>> comment <<} Chatman further refines his analysis of narrative voice and focalization, emphasizing the importance of who tells the story and from what perspective. He discusses the implications of different narrative voices (e.g., first-person, third-person) and how focalization can control the flow of information to the audience.

3. **Adaptation and Narrative Form**:
   - In *"Coming to Terms,"* Chatman also addresses the issue of adaptation, particularly how narratives change when they are adapted from one medium to another (e.g., from novel to film). He explores how the constraints and affordances of different media affect the narrative form and its rhetorical effects.

4. **The Implied Reader and Spectator**:
   - Chatman expands on the concept of the *implied reader* from *"Story and Discourse,"* introducing the idea of the *implied spectator* in film. This concept refers to the idealized audience that the narrative seems to address, shaped by the narrative's structure and content.

5. **Intertextuality and Genre**:
   - {== elaborate ==}{>> comment <<} Chatman explores the role of intertextuality and genre in narrative construction, examining how narratives draw on and refer to other texts and genres. He discusses how these references contribute to the meaning of the narrative and the expectations of the audience.

## Topics of Interest in Chatman’s Other Contributions

Beyond *"Story and Discourse"* and *"Coming to Terms,"* Seymour Chatman made significant contributions to the broader field of narratology and film studies:

1. **Semiotics and Structuralism**:
   - Chatman’s work is deeply rooted in semiotic and structuralist theory. He applied these frameworks to the analysis of narrative, exploring how signs and structures convey meaning in both literature and film. His interdisciplinary approach helped to bridge the gap between literary theory and film studies.

2. **Narrative Theory in Visual Arts**:
   - Chatman extended his analysis of narrative to the visual arts, examining how narrative structures operate in non-cinematic visual media, such as painting and photography. His work in this area contributed to a broader understanding of how narratives function across different forms of art.

3. **Teaching and Pedagogy**:
   - Chatman was also known for his contributions to the teaching of narrative theory. He developed frameworks and methodologies that have been widely adopted in academic settings, helping to shape the study of narrative in literature and film.

4. **Analysis of Specific Films and Texts**:
   - Throughout his career, Chatman applied his theories to the analysis of specific films and literary texts, providing detailed case studies that illustrate his concepts in practice. These analyses have been influential in demonstrating the applicability of narratological theory to concrete examples.

5. **Influence on Later Theorists**:
   - Chatman’s work has influenced a wide range of scholars in narratology, film studies, and media theory. His concepts of story vs. discourse, narrative communication, and the implied author have been particularly impactful, shaping the direction of subsequent research in these fields.

## Conclusion

Seymour Chatman’s *"Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film"* and *"Coming to Terms: The Rhetoric of Narrative in Fiction and Film"* are foundational texts in narratology, offering comprehensive frameworks for analyzing narrative structure in both literature and film. His interdisciplinary approach, grounded in semiotics and structuralism, has had a lasting impact on the study of narrative across different media. Chatman’s contributions to narrative theory, film studies, and the teaching of narratology continue to influence scholars and students alike.
