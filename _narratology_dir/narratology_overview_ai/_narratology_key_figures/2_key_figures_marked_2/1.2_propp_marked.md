### Title: **Propp's 31 Narrative Functions Framework**

- **Vladimir Propp's 31 Narrative Functions**:
  - **Definition**: Vladimir Propp identified 31 narrative functions in his seminal work *"Morphology of the Folktale"*. These functions represent the fundamental building blocks of folktale narratives and typically occur in a fixed sequence.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Fixed Sequence of Events**:
      - **Definition**: The 31 functions follow a specific order in folktales, starting with an initial situation and moving through various stages of conflict, action, and resolution. Each function contributes to the narrative’s progression and the development of the hero’s journey.
      - **Contextualization**: Propp’s framework has been influential in the study of narrative structure, providing a systematic approach to analyzing folktales and identifying common patterns across different cultures and stories. By categorizing these functions, Propp laid the groundwork for understanding the universal elements of storytelling.


1. **Absentation**:
   - A family member leaves the home or is otherwise absent (e.g., a parent dies or goes away, the hero departs).

2. **Interdiction**:
   - A prohibition or command is given to the hero (e.g., "Do not go into the forest").

3. **Violation of Interdiction**:
   - The interdiction is violated (e.g., the hero disobeys and goes into the forest).

4. **Reconnaissance**:
   - The villain attempts to gather information about the hero (e.g., spies on the hero, tries to find out about weaknesses).

5. **Delivery**:
   - The villain receives information about the hero (e.g., finds out where the hero lives or about a secret).

6. **Trickery**:
   - The villain attempts to deceive the hero (e.g., disguises themselves, pretends to be someone else).

7. **Complicity**:
   - The hero is deceived by the villain and unwittingly helps them (e.g., the hero believes the villain’s lies or gives away crucial information).

8. **Villainy**:
   - The villain causes harm or injury to a family member (e.g., kidnapping, theft, casting a spell).

9. **Mediation**:
   - The hero becomes aware of the villainy or a lack and is dispatched or receives a call to action (e.g., the hero is told of the loss and sets out to find a solution).

10. **Counteraction**:
    - The hero decides to act in response to the villainy or lack (e.g., prepares to embark on a quest).

11. **Departure**:
    - The hero leaves home to begin the quest (e.g., setting out on the journey).

12. **First Function of the Donor**:
    - The hero encounters a donor who tests, interrogates, or attacks the hero (e.g., the hero meets a magical helper who challenges them).

13. **Hero's Reaction**:
    - The hero responds to the actions of the donor, often passing a test or showing kindness (e.g., the hero passes the test, helps the donor, or solves a riddle).

14. **Acquisition**:
    - The hero receives a magical agent or object as a reward (e.g., a sword, potion, or ring).

15. **Guidance**:
    - The hero is led to the whereabouts of the object of the search (e.g., the hero is shown the way to the villain's lair).

16. **Struggle**:
    - The hero and the villain engage in direct combat or a battle (e.g., a fight, a contest).

17. **Branding**:
    - The hero is marked in some way (e.g., receives a scar, brand, or some distinguishing feature).

18. **Victory**:
    - The villain is defeated (e.g., killed, captured, or driven away).

19. **Liquidation**:
    - The initial misfortune or lack is resolved (e.g., the hero rescues the victim, retrieves the stolen item, breaks the spell).

20. **Return**:
    - The hero starts the journey back home (e.g., begins the return trip).

21. **Pursuit**:
    - The hero is pursued by the villain or another antagonist (e.g., the villain chases the hero to prevent them from returning).

22. **Rescue**:
    - The hero is rescued from pursuit or a trap (e.g., is saved by a magical helper or a sudden intervention).

23. **Unrecognized Arrival**:
    - The hero returns home or to another place but is not recognized (e.g., returns in disguise, or the hero's identity is unknown).

24. **Unfounded Claims**:
    - A false hero presents unfounded claims to the success or achievements of the hero (e.g., someone else claims to have done what the hero did).

25. **Difficult Task**:
    - A difficult task is proposed to the hero (e.g., a final test or challenge to prove worth).

26. **Solution**:
    - The hero successfully completes the difficult task (e.g., solves the challenge, wins a contest).

27. **Recognition**:
    - The hero is recognized, usually by some distinguishing feature or a revelation (e.g., the hero’s identity is revealed).

28. **Exposure**:
    - The false hero or villain is exposed (e.g., the true nature of the impostor is revealed).

29. **Transfiguration**:
    - The hero is given a new appearance or is rewarded (e.g., the hero is transformed, crowned, or given new clothes).

30. **Punishment**:
    - The villain or false hero is punished (e.g., the villain is executed, exiled, or otherwise brought to justice).

31. **Wedding**:
    - The hero is rewarded, typically through marriage or ascension to a throne (e.g., the hero marries the princess or becomes king).

### Title: **Propp's Spheres of Action Framework**
Vladimir Propp categorized characters in folktales into seven broad types based on their roles and functions within the narrative. These roles, or "Spheres of Action," are essential to understanding the structure of the tale and the relationship between characters.

1. **The Villain**:
   - **Role**: The antagonist who opposes the hero and creates obstacles or challenges.
   - **Function**: The villain's actions drive the conflict of the story. They may cause harm, deceive, or challenge the hero, creating the central problem that the hero must overcome.

2. **The Donor**:
   - **Role**: The character who prepares the hero or provides them with a magical object or assistance.
   - **Function**: The donor tests the hero's worthiness, often through a challenge or task. If the hero passes the test, the donor rewards them with a magical item, advice, or knowledge that is crucial for the hero's success.

3. **The Helper**:
   - **Role**: The character who aids the hero in their quest.
   - **Function**: The helper provides support to the hero, often in critical moments. This assistance can come in the form of physical help, guidance, or the use of a magical object provided by the donor.

4. **The Princess (and her father)**:
   - **Role**: The sought-after person (often female) who acts as the hero's reward and/or the hero's goal.
   - **Function**: The princess is usually the object of the hero's quest, often requiring rescue from the villain. Her father, if present, often sets tasks for the hero or offers the hero a reward. The princess's hand in marriage or the father's blessing often serves as the ultimate prize for the hero's success.

5. **The Dispatcher**:
   - **Role**: The character who sends the hero on their quest.
   - **Function**: The dispatcher recognizes a lack or a problem and sends the hero on the mission to resolve it. This character initiates the hero's journey, setting the story in motion.

6. **The Hero**:
   - **Role**: The protagonist who seeks something valuable and strives to restore equilibrium.
   - **Function**: The hero is the central character around whom the story revolves. The hero takes on challenges, battles the villain, and undergoes a transformation. In the end, the hero often gains something of value, whether it be a reward, wisdom, or a new status.

7. **The False Hero**:
   - **Role**: A character who initially seems to be a hero but ultimately proves to be unworthy or deceptive.
   - **Function**: The false hero often tries to take credit for the hero's actions or seeks to usurp the hero's position. This character's duplicity is usually revealed toward the end of the story, leading to their exposure and punishment.
