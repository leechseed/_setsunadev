### **Rimmon-Kenan's Narrative Levels Framework**

- **Narrative Levels**:
  - **Definition**: Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan explores the concept of narrative levels, which refer to the different layers or planes of narration within a story. This framework includes the distinction between extradiegetic and intradiegetic levels, as well as the phenomenon of metalepsis, which complicates the relationship between these levels.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **Extradiegetic Level**

- **Definition**: 
  - The extradiegetic level refers to narration that occurs outside the story world. This is typically the primary level of narration, where the narrator is not a character within the narrative but exists externally to tell the story.

- **Components of the Extradiegetic Level**:
  - **Narrative Authority**:
    - **Definition**: The extradiegetic narrator often holds a position of authority, providing the reader with a seemingly objective overview of the narrative. This narrator controls the flow of information and shapes the reader’s understanding of the story.
    - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan emphasizes that the extradiegetic level is where the narrative voice establishes its reliability or potential biases, influencing how the reader interprets the story.
    - **Examples**: In *Wuthering Heights* by Emily Brontë, the extradiegetic narrator, Mr. Lockwood, frames the entire narrative, providing an external perspective that shapes the reader's initial understanding of the story.

  - **Framing Device**:
    - **Definition**: The extradiegetic level often serves as a framing device, setting up the context for the intradiegetic narrative. This framing can provide background information, introduce themes, or create a narrative lens through which the story is told.
    - **Contextualization**: The framing device is crucial for understanding how the narrative is structured and how the story is presented to the reader. It can also influence the reader's perception of the intradiegetic events.
    - **Examples**: In *Heart of Darkness* by Joseph Conrad, the extradiegetic level is represented by the anonymous narrator who introduces Marlow and frames his tale within a larger narrative context.

  - **Narrative Distance**:
    - **Definition**: The extradiegetic narrator typically maintains a certain distance from the events of the story, providing a detached or overarching perspective. This distance can influence the tone and mood of the narrative.
    - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan points out that narrative distance is a key factor in determining how much the reader is invited to engage emotionally with the story. A distant extradiegetic narrator may create a more analytical or reflective tone.
    - **Examples**: In *The Odyssey* by Homer, the extradiegetic narrator recounts the epic tale with a broad, distant perspective, emphasizing the grandeur and timelessness of Odysseus's journey.

#### **Intradiegetic Level**

- **Definition**: 
  - The intradiegetic level refers to narration that occurs within the story world, often involving characters who tell stories within the narrative. This level is embedded within the primary narrative and introduces additional layers of storytelling.

- **Components of the Intradiegetic Level**:
  - **Embedded Narratives**:
    - **Definition**: Narratives told by characters within the story, which may provide backstory, reveal character motivations, or introduce parallel plotlines. These embedded narratives add complexity and depth to the overall story.
    - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan highlights that intradiegetic narratives allow for multiple perspectives and voices within the same text, enriching the narrative by offering different viewpoints and interpretations.
    - **Examples**: In *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley, the narrative is intradiegetic when Victor Frankenstein recounts his tale to Captain Walton, who is already a narrator within the larger story.

  - **Character Perspective**:
    - **Definition**: The intradiegetic narrator is often a character within the story, providing a subjective and potentially biased account of events. This perspective can contrast with the extradiegetic narrative, creating layers of interpretation for the reader.
    - **Contextualization**: The subjective nature of intradiegetic narration challenges the reader to consider the reliability and motivations of the character-narrator, adding complexity to the narrative structure.
    - **Examples**: In *The Canterbury Tales* by Geoffrey Chaucer, each pilgrim serves as an intradiegetic narrator, telling their own story within the larger frame of the pilgrimage, each with their own biases and perspectives.

  - **Narrative Depth and Multiplicity**:
    - **Definition**: The use of multiple intradiegetic levels can create a narrative with significant depth, where stories within stories reflect or contradict each other, adding layers of meaning and interpretation.
    - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan notes that this multiplicity can lead to a richer, more complex narrative, where the interplay between different narrative levels enhances the reader’s understanding of the text’s themes and characters.
    - **Examples**: In *The Arabian Nights*, the structure of stories within stories creates a rich tapestry of interconnected narratives, each adding to the overall meaning and complexity of the text.

#### **Metalepsis**

- **Definition**: 
  - Metalepsis occurs when the boundaries between different narrative levels are transgressed, such as when a character interacts with the narrator or steps outside their narrative world.

- **Components of Metalepsis**:
  - **Boundary Transgression**:
    - **Definition**: Metalepsis involves the breaking of the narrative "fourth wall," where characters or narrators move between different levels of the narrative, often in unexpected or jarring ways.
    - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan discusses how metalepsis can create a sense of disruption or surrealism in the narrative, challenging the reader’s understanding of the story’s reality.
    - **Examples**: In *Don Quixote* by Miguel de Cervantes, the characters are aware of their existence within a book, with Don Quixote even commenting on the author, creating a metaleptic effect that blurs the lines between fiction and reality.

  - **Narrative Playfulness**:
    - **Definition**: Metalepsis often introduces a playful or experimental quality to the narrative, where the text itself becomes self-aware, and the reader is invited to engage with the narrative on a more reflective level.
    - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan suggests that metalepsis can be used to explore the nature of storytelling and the relationship between fiction and reality, encouraging readers to think critically about the narrative form.
    - **Examples**: In *Italo Calvino’s* *If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler*, the narrative frequently shifts between the story and the reader’s experience of reading the story, creating a metaleptic effect that questions the boundaries of fiction.

  - **Thematic Implications**:
    - **Definition**: The use of metalepsis can also have thematic implications, such as exploring concepts of reality versus fiction, the power of storytelling, or the limitations of narrative structures.
    - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan points out that metalepsis often serves to underline the artificiality of the narrative, prompting readers to consider deeper themes related to perception, reality, and the nature of truth within the story.
    - **Examples**: In *The Neverending Story* by Michael Ende, the protagonist Bastian enters the story he is reading, blurring the lines between reader and character, and exploring themes of identity, reality, and imagination.
