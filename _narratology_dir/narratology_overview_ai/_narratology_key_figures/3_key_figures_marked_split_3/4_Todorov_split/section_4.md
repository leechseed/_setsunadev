### Title: **Todorov's Fantastic Mode Framework**

- **The Fantastic**:
  - **Definition**: In *"The Poetics of Prose,"* one of Todorov’s significant contributions is his exploration of the fantastic as a narrative mode. He defines the fantastic as a genre that occupies a space of hesitation between the natural and the supernatural, creating a narrative tension where the reader is uncertain whether the events can be explained by natural laws or involve supernatural elements.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Hesitation Between the Natural and Supernatural**:
      - **Definition**: The fantastic exists in the ambiguity between the real and the unreal, where neither the natural nor the supernatural explanation is fully confirmed. This hesitation is crucial to maintaining the fantastic mode.
      - **Contextualization**: Todorov’s concept of the fantastic highlights the unique tension and uncertainty that this mode creates. The reader's inability to definitively categorize the narrative as either realistic or supernatural drives the engagement with the text, making the fantastic a powerful tool for exploring the boundaries of reality.
    - **Narrative Tension**:
      - **Definition**: The tension in fantastic literature arises from the reader’s and the characters’ struggle to reconcile the strange events with their understanding of the world. This unresolved tension is what defines the fantastic and differentiates it from other narrative modes.
      - **Contextualization**: Todorov’s exploration of the fantastic mode provides a framework for analyzing stories that deliberately blur the line between reality and fantasy. This analysis is particularly useful in understanding how such narratives manipulate reader expectations and provoke deeper reflections on the nature of reality.
