### Title: **Herman's Temporal Logic in Narrative Framework**
- **Temporal Logic in Narrative**:
  - **Definition**: Herman explores the temporal dimensions of narrative, focusing on how stories manipulate time to create meaning. He examines techniques like anachrony (non-chronological storytelling), foreshadowing, and flashbacks, and how these affect the reader’s perception of time within the narrative.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Temporal Manipulation**:
      - **Definition**: Temporal manipulation involves altering the sequence or duration of events in a narrative to create suspense, emphasize certain aspects, or convey complex ideas.
      - **Contextualization**: Herman’s analysis of temporal logic extends to the cognitive processes involved in understanding and interpreting these temporal structures, linking narrative time with mental time. This framework enhances the understanding of how narratives play with time to engage the reader and convey deeper meanings.
