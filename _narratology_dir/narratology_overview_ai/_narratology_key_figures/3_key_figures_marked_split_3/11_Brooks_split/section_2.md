### Title: **Brooks's Narrative Temporality Framework**
- **Narrative Temporality**:
  - **Definition**: Peter Brooks explores the temporal structure of narrative, focusing on how narratives manipulate time to create suspense and delay resolution. He discusses how techniques like *prolepsis* (anticipation or flashforward) and *analepsis* (flashback) affect the reader’s experience of time within the story.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Prolepsis (Flashforward)**:
      - **Definition**: Prolepsis involves the anticipation or foreshadowing of future events within the narrative, creating suspense by hinting at what is to come.
      - **Contextualization**: This technique plays a crucial role in building anticipation and tension, as it allows the narrative to create expectations that propel the reader forward.
    - **Analepsis (Flashback)**:
      - **Definition**: Analepsis refers to the narrative technique of recounting past events, often providing essential background or context that enriches the current storyline.
      - **Contextualization**: By manipulating time in this way, narratives can deepen the reader’s understanding of characters and plot, while also maintaining suspense by revealing information gradually.
