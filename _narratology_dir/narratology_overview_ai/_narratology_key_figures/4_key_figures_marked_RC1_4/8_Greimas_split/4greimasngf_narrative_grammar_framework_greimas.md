### Title: **Greimas's Narrative Grammar Framework**

- **Narrative Grammar**:
  - **Definition**: Greimas extends the idea of structural semantics to the concept of *narrative grammar*. He argues that just as sentences have a grammatical structure, narratives have a deep structure that can be analyzed using similar principles.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Transformations and Transitions**:
      - **Definition**: Narrative grammar involves the mapping of transformations and transitions between different narrative states, revealing the underlying logic of the story.
      - **Contextualization**: This approach allows for a systematic analysis of narrative progression, helping to identify the rules and patterns that govern the flow of the narrative from one state to another.
