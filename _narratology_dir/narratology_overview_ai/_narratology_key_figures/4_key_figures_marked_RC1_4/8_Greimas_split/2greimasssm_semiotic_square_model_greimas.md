### Title: **Greimas's Semiotic Square Model**

- **The Semiotic Square**:
  - **Definition**: One of Greimas' most influential contributions is the development of the *semiotic square*, a tool for mapping the relationships between different concepts in a narrative. The semiotic square is a diagram that represents the oppositions, contradictions, and complementarities between key terms or concepts.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Binary Oppositions**:
      - **Definition**: The semiotic square is particularly effective in analyzing binary oppositions within narratives, such as good vs. evil or life vs. death.
      - **Contextualization**: By visualizing these oppositions, the semiotic square helps to uncover the deeper semantic structures of a narrative, showing how opposing concepts are related, resolved, or maintained in tension.
    - **Conceptual Relationships**:
      - **Definition**: The semiotic square also maps the relationships between contradictory and complementary concepts, providing a framework for analyzing the complexity of meanings within a text.
      - **Contextualization**: This tool is essential for understanding how narratives negotiate meaning through the interplay of opposing and related ideas, making it a powerful method for narrative analysis.
