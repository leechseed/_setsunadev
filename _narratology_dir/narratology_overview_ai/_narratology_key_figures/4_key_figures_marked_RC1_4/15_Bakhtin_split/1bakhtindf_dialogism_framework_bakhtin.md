### Title: **Bakhtin's Dialogism Framework**
- **Dialogism**:
  - **Definition**: Dialogism is a central concept in Mikhail Bakhtin’s work, referring to the idea that all language—and by extension, all narrative—is inherently dialogic. This means it is shaped by the interaction of multiple voices, each representing different perspectives, ideologies, and social positions.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Interplay of Voices**:
      - **Definition**: In narratives, dialogism manifests as the interplay of different characters’ voices, narrative perspectives, and the relationship between the author’s voice and those of the characters.
      - **Contextualization**: Bakhtin argues that meaning is generated through this interaction rather than being a fixed or singular entity. Dialogism highlights the dynamic nature of narrative meaning, showing how it emerges from the ongoing dialogue between various voices within the text.
