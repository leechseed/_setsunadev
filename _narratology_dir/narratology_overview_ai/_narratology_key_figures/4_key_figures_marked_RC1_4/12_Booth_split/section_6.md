### Title: **Booth's Rhetoric of Irony Framework**
- **A Rhetoric of Irony**:
  - **Definition**: In *"A Rhetoric of Irony"* (1974), Wayne C. Booth examines the use of irony in narrative, exploring how authors create layers of meaning and engage readers in complex interpretive tasks.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Types of Irony**:
      - **Definition**: Booth discusses different types of irony, including verbal irony (where the intended meaning is opposite to the literal meaning), situational irony (where there is a discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes), and dramatic irony (where the audience knows something that the characters do not).
      - **Contextualization**: Irony adds depth to the narrative by requiring the reader to read between the lines and recognize the multiple layers of meaning that irony introduces. Booth’s analysis helps to understand how irony can be used to challenge the reader’s assumptions and deepen their engagement with the text.
