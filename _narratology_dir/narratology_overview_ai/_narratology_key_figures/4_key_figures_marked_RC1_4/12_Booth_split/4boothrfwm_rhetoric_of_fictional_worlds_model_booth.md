### Title: **Booth's Rhetoric of Fictional Worlds Model**
- **The Rhetoric of Fictional Worlds**:
  - **Definition**: Booth examines how authors construct fictional worlds and how these worlds engage readers. He argues that the creation of a believable and coherent fictional world is a rhetorical act, designed to immerse the reader and make the narrative’s events and characters convincing.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **World-Building as Rhetoric**:
      - **Definition**: The construction of fictional worlds involves careful attention to detail, consistency, and plausibility, all of which are rhetorical strategies aimed at persuading the reader to accept the reality of the story world.
      - **Contextualization**: By viewing world-building as a rhetorical process, Booth emphasizes the intentionality behind narrative construction and the role of the reader’s suspension of disbelief in fully engaging with the narrative.
