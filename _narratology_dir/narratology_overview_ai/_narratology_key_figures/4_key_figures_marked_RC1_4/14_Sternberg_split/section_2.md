### Title: **Sternberg's Temporal Ordering Framework**
- **Temporal Ordering**:
  - **Definition**: A central theme in Sternberg’s work is *temporal ordering*, which refers to the sequence in which events are presented in the narrative. This concept explores how the manipulation of time within a story can influence the reader’s experience and interpretation.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Anachrony**:
      - **Definition**: The reordering of events in a non-chronological sequence, including techniques like *analepsis* (flashbacks) and *prolepsis* (flashforwards).
      - **Contextualization**: Anachrony disrupts the linear progression of time, allowing the narrative to reveal past or future events at strategic moments. This manipulation of time can create suspense, provide deeper context, or enhance thematic resonance.
    - **Duration**:
      - **Definition**: Duration refers to the relationship between the time covered by the narrative and the time taken to narrate it. This affects how events are experienced by the reader, influencing the narrative’s pacing and focus.
      - **Contextualization**: By varying the duration of events (e.g., through summary or detailed scene), authors can emphasize certain moments, control the flow of the narrative, and shape the reader’s emotional and cognitive engagement with the story.
    - **Frequency**:
      - **Definition**: Frequency concerns how often events are repeated in the narrative, which can emphasize their importance or provide different perspectives on the same event.
      - **Contextualization**: Repetition of events can create thematic depth, reinforce key ideas, or explore the consequences of actions from multiple angles, adding layers of meaning to the narrative.
