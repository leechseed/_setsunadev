### Title: **Sternberg's Expositional Modes Framework**
- **Expositional Modes**:
  - **Definition**: Meir Sternberg identifies various *expositional modes* that authors use to present information to the reader, each serving different narrative functions and influencing how the story is understood.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Direct Exposition**:
      - **Definition**: Information is presented straightforwardly, with minimal delay, often used to provide essential background, context, or character details necessary for understanding the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Direct exposition is typically employed when the author wants to quickly establish the setting, context, or motivations without creating suspense. It helps to orient the reader and ensure they have the foundational knowledge needed to follow the narrative.
    - **Delayed Exposition**:
      - **Definition**: Information is withheld or gradually revealed over the course of the narrative, used to build suspense, create mysteries, or enhance the impact of eventual revelations.
      - **Contextualization**: Delayed exposition engages the reader by creating a sense of anticipation, as the withheld information becomes a focal point of interest, driving the reader’s curiosity and investment in the narrative’s outcome.
    - **Suspended Exposition**:
      - **Definition**: Certain details are withheld until they are absolutely necessary for the story’s progression. This mode is closely related to the narrative strategies of surprise and suspense, playing with the reader’s expectations and curiosity.
      - **Contextualization**: Suspended exposition is a powerful tool for controlling the narrative’s pacing and the reader’s emotional responses, strategically revealing critical information at key moments to maximize its impact.

### Title: **Sternberg's Temporal Ordering Framework**
- **Temporal Ordering**:
  - **Definition**: A central theme in Sternberg’s work is *temporal ordering*, which refers to the sequence in which events are presented in the narrative. This concept explores how the manipulation of time within a story can influence the reader’s experience and interpretation.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Anachrony**:
      - **Definition**: The reordering of events in a non-chronological sequence, including techniques like *analepsis* (flashbacks) and *prolepsis* (flashforwards).
      - **Contextualization**: Anachrony disrupts the linear progression of time, allowing the narrative to reveal past or future events at strategic moments. This manipulation of time can create suspense, provide deeper context, or enhance thematic resonance.
    - **Duration**:
      - **Definition**: Duration refers to the relationship between the time covered by the narrative and the time taken to narrate it. This affects how events are experienced by the reader, influencing the narrative’s pacing and focus.
      - **Contextualization**: By varying the duration of events (e.g., through summary or detailed scene), authors can emphasize certain moments, control the flow of the narrative, and shape the reader’s emotional and cognitive engagement with the story.
    - **Frequency**:
      - **Definition**: Frequency concerns how often events are repeated in the narrative, which can emphasize their importance or provide different perspectives on the same event.
      - **Contextualization**: Repetition of events can create thematic depth, reinforce key ideas, or explore the consequences of actions from multiple angles, adding layers of meaning to the narrative.

### Title: **Sternberg's Suspense, Curiosity, and Surprise Model**
- **Suspense, Curiosity, and Surprise**:
  - **Definition**: Sternberg’s work focuses on the emotional and cognitive effects that narrative structures can evoke in the reader. He identifies three key responses—suspense, curiosity, and surprise—that are central to the reader’s engagement with the narrative.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Suspense**:
      - **Definition**: Suspense is a state of anticipation about the outcome of an event that is yet to occur, often created by delayed or suspended exposition.
      - **Contextualization**: Suspense keeps the reader invested in the narrative, generating tension as they wait to see how events will unfold. It is a driving force that sustains the reader’s attention and emotional involvement in the story.
    - **Curiosity**:
      - **Definition**: Curiosity is the desire to know the causes or background of an event that has already been presented, often evoked by anachronic narratives that reveal effects before causes.
      - **Contextualization**: Curiosity motivates the reader to seek out missing information, encouraging deeper engagement with the narrative as they piece together the story’s chronology and underlying connections.
    - **Surprise**:
      - **Definition**: Surprise is a reaction to an unexpected event or revelation, often resulting from the strategic withholding of information or misleading exposition.
      - **Contextualization**: Surprise can reframe the reader’s understanding of the narrative, prompting them to reconsider previous assumptions and enhancing the overall impact of the story through unexpected twists and revelations.
