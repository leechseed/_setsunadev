### Title: **Tomashevsky's Plot vs. Story Framework**

- **Plot vs. Story**:
  - **Definition**: Building on the work of Vladimir Propp and other Formalists, Boris Tomashevsky makes a clear distinction between *fabula* (story) and *sjuzhet* (plot), each serving different functions in the narrative.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Fabula**:
      - **Definition**: *Fabula* refers to the chronological sequence of events as they occur in the world of the narrative. It is the raw material of the story, representing what happens in a linear timeline.
      - **Contextualization**: The fabula provides the foundational events of the narrative, offering a straightforward account of what transpires within the story world, independent of how these events are presented.
    - **Sjuzhet**:
      - **Definition**: *Sjuzhet* is the way these events are arranged and presented in the narrative. It is the artistic construction of the story, designed to create specific effects and manipulate the reader’s perception of the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: The sjuzhet is crucial for the narrative’s impact, as it controls the pacing, reveals information selectively, and guides the reader’s emotional and intellectual response. Tomashevsky emphasizes that the sjuzhet is not just a reflection of the fabula but a deliberate construction that shapes the narrative experience.
