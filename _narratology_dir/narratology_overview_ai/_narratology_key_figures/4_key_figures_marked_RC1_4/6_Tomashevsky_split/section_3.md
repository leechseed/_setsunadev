### Title: **Tomashevsky's Narrative Functions Framework**

- **Narrative Functions**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky’s analysis of narrative functions focuses on the role that different elements of the narrative play in advancing the plot and developing the theme. He categorizes these functions into two types: *bound motifs* and *free motifs*.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Bound Motifs**:
      - **Definition**: Bound motifs are essential to the progression of the narrative. They are necessary for the development of the plot and cannot be removed without altering the narrative’s core structure.
      - **Contextualization**: Bound motifs drive the story forward, ensuring that the narrative maintains its logical sequence and coherence. They are the key events or actions that shape the narrative’s trajectory.
    - **Free Motifs**:
      - **Definition**: Free motifs are not essential to the plot but contribute to the atmosphere, characterization, or thematic depth of the narrative. They enrich the story by adding layers of meaning and emotional resonance.
      - **Contextualization**: Free motifs enhance the narrative’s aesthetic and thematic qualities, providing additional context or emotional impact without altering the main plotline. They offer depth and texture to the story, making it more engaging and multifaceted.
