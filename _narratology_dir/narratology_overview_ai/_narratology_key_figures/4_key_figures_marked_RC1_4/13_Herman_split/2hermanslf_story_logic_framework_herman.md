### Title: **Herman's Story Logic Framework**
- **Story Logic**:
  - **Definition**: The concept of *story logic* refers to the underlying principles that govern the organization and coherence of narratives. Herman examines how stories are structured to create logical connections between events, characters, and settings, facilitating the narrative's intelligibility and impact.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrative Coherence**:
      - **Definition**: Story logic involves understanding how different elements of a narrative fit together to form a coherent whole. This includes recognizing causal relationships, thematic connections, and the narrative's overall structure.
      - **Contextualization**: Herman argues that understanding a narrative's logic requires both an analysis of its formal elements and an awareness of the cognitive strategies that readers or viewers use to interpret these elements. This approach bridges traditional narrative theory with cognitive insights, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how stories work.
