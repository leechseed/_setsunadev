### Title: **Abbott's Narrative Gaps and Reader Involvement Framework**
- **Narrative Gaps and Reader Involvement**:
  - **Definition**: Abbott emphasizes the role of the reader in constructing the meaning of a narrative, focusing on the concept of *gaps*—moments where information is omitted or left ambiguous.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrative Gaps**:
      - **Definition**: Gaps in a narrative are deliberate omissions or ambiguities that invite the reader to actively participate in the story by filling in the missing pieces.
      - **Contextualization**: Abbott argues that these gaps are not just absences but opportunities for reader engagement. By leaving certain elements open to interpretation, narratives encourage readers to contribute to the creation of meaning, making the reading experience more interactive and dynamic.
    - **Reader Involvement**:
      - **Definition**: Reader involvement refers to the active role that readers play in interpreting and completing the narrative. It highlights the collaborative nature of storytelling, where meaning is co-created by the author and the reader.
      - **Contextualization**: This concept is central to Abbott’s approach to narratology, as it underscores the importance of the reader's agency in the narrative process. By engaging with gaps, readers become co-authors in the construction of the story, making each reading experience unique.
