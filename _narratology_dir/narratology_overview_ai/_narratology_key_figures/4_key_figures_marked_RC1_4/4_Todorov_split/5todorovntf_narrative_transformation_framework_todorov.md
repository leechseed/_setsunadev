### Title: **Todorov's Narrative Transformation Framework**

- **Narrative Transformation**:
  - **Definition**: Todorov explores the concept of narrative transformation, where a narrative structure evolves into another form, either within a single text or across texts within a genre. This concept is key to understanding how narratives adapt and change over time, reflecting shifts in cultural and literary contexts.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **In-Text Transformation**:
      - **Definition**: Transformation within a single text refers to the evolution of a narrative structure as the story progresses. This can involve shifts in genre, tone, or narrative focus, leading to a dynamic reading experience.
      - **Contextualization**: In-text transformations highlight the fluid nature of narratives and their ability to adapt to new developments within the story. This concept allows for a deeper analysis of how stories can shift direction, reframe their themes, or introduce new narrative elements as they unfold.
    - **Cross-Text Transformation**:
      - **Definition**: Cross-text transformation occurs when narratives within a genre evolve over time, leading to new iterations or hybrid forms. This transformation reflects broader changes in literary traditions and cultural influences.
      - **Contextualization**: By studying cross-text transformations, Todorov provides insights into how genres themselves adapt and evolve. This analysis is crucial for understanding the lifecycle of genres, how they respond to new cultural contexts, and how they influence the development of new narrative forms.
