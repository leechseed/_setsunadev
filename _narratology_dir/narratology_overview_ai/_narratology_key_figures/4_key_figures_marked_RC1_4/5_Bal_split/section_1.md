### Title: **Bal's Narrative Agents Framework**

- **Narrative Agents**:
  - **Definition**: Mieke Bal introduces the concept of narrative agents, which are the key participants in the construction and delivery of a narrative. These agents include the narrator, focalizer, and actor, each playing a distinct role in how the story is presented and interpreted.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrator**:
      - **Definition**: The narrator is the agent responsible for telling the story. Bal emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between different types of narrators, such as *first-person* and *third-person* narrators, and further categorizes them into *reliable* and *unreliable* narrators.
      - **Contextualization**: Understanding the role of the narrator is crucial for interpreting the narrative’s reliability and bias. Bal’s framework encourages readers to critically assess the narrator’s position and influence on the story, which can significantly affect the audience's perception of the narrative.
    - **Focalizer**:
      - **Definition**: The focalizer is the agent through whose perspective the events of the story are presented. Bal builds on Gérard Genette’s work, refining the concept of focalization to offer a more flexible framework for understanding narrative perspective.
      - **Contextualization**: The distinction between the narrator and focalizer allows for a deeper analysis of how stories are told and perceived. By separating these roles, Bal provides a tool for exploring how different perspectives and viewpoints are constructed within a text, influencing the reader’s engagement with the narrative.
    - **Actor**:
      - **Definition**: The actor refers to the characters or entities that perform actions within the narrative. Bal explores how these actors are constructed and how their roles contribute to the overall meaning of the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Actors are essential to the narrative’s progression and thematic development. Bal’s framework encourages the examination of how characters are portrayed, their motivations, and their impact on the narrative’s outcome, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the story’s dynamics.
