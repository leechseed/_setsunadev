### Title: **Bal's Narrative Agents Framework**

- **Narrative Agents**:
  - **Definition**: Mieke Bal introduces the concept of narrative agents, which are the key participants in the construction and delivery of a narrative. These agents include the narrator, focalizer, and actor, each playing a distinct role in how the story is presented and interpreted.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrator**:
      - **Definition**: The narrator is the agent responsible for telling the story. Bal emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between different types of narrators, such as *first-person* and *third-person* narrators, and further categorizes them into *reliable* and *unreliable* narrators.
      - **Contextualization**: Understanding the role of the narrator is crucial for interpreting the narrative’s reliability and bias. Bal’s framework encourages readers to critically assess the narrator’s position and influence on the story, which can significantly affect the audience's perception of the narrative.
    - **Focalizer**:
      - **Definition**: The focalizer is the agent through whose perspective the events of the story are presented. Bal builds on Gérard Genette’s work, refining the concept of focalization to offer a more flexible framework for understanding narrative perspective.
      - **Contextualization**: The distinction between the narrator and focalizer allows for a deeper analysis of how stories are told and perceived. By separating these roles, Bal provides a tool for exploring how different perspectives and viewpoints are constructed within a text, influencing the reader’s engagement with the narrative.
    - **Actor**:
      - **Definition**: The actor refers to the characters or entities that perform actions within the narrative. Bal explores how these actors are constructed and how their roles contribute to the overall meaning of the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Actors are essential to the narrative’s progression and thematic development. Bal’s framework encourages the examination of how characters are portrayed, their motivations, and their impact on the narrative’s outcome, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the story’s dynamics.

### Title: **Bal's Temporal Structures Framework**

- **Temporal Structures**:
  - **Definition**: Mieke Bal’s analysis of temporal structures in narrative focuses on how time is manipulated within a story. She examines the concepts of *order*, *duration*, and *frequency*, providing a framework for understanding the temporal dynamics of narratives.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Order**:
      - **Definition**: Order refers to the arrangement of events in the narrative, which may differ from their chronological sequence. Bal explores how anachronies, such as flashbacks and flashforwards, influence the interpretation of the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: The manipulation of narrative order affects how the story is understood, particularly in how past and future events are revealed to the reader. Bal’s framework highlights the significance of these temporal shifts in shaping the reader’s experience and understanding of the narrative.
    - **Duration**:
      - **Definition**: Duration describes the relationship between the time of the events in the story and the time it takes to narrate them. This concept includes techniques like summary, scene, and ellipsis, which control the pacing of the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: Duration is a key factor in narrative pacing and focus. By analyzing how time is compressed or expanded, Bal’s framework helps to understand the narrative’s emphasis on certain events and the overall rhythm of the story.
    - **Frequency**:
      - **Definition**: Frequency refers to the number of times an event is narrated. Bal distinguishes between *singulative* (one event narrated once), *repeating* (one event narrated multiple times), and *iterative* (multiple events narrated once) narration.
      - **Contextualization**: The concept of frequency allows for the analysis of repetition and emphasis within a narrative. Bal’s framework provides insights into how the repetition of events or actions can affect the story’s thematic development and the reader’s perception of its significance.

### Title: **Bal's Focalization Framework**

- **Focalization**:
  - **Definition**: One of Mieke Bal’s significant contributions to narratology is her detailed analysis of focalization. She distinguishes between the *focalizer* (the agent whose perspective shapes the narrative) and the *focalized* (the object or character being perceived). This distinction allows for a more nuanced analysis of narrative perspective.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Focalizer**:
      - **Definition**: The focalizer is the entity through whose perspective the narrative is presented. This can be a character within the story or an external narrator, influencing how the events and characters are perceived by the reader.
      - **Contextualization**: The concept of the focalizer is crucial for understanding how different viewpoints are constructed within a text. Bal’s framework allows for an exploration of how the focalizer’s perspective shapes the narrative’s tone, bias, and overall interpretation.
    - **Focalized**:
      - **Definition**: The focalized is the object or character being perceived by the focalizer. This distinction helps in analyzing the relationship between the observer and the observed within the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: By distinguishing between the focalizer and the focalized, Bal’s framework enables a deeper exploration of how narratives construct relationships between characters, events, and the reader. It highlights the complexities of narrative perspective and the ways in which different viewpoints can influence the story’s meaning.
