### Title: **Bal's Focalization Framework**

- **Focalization**:
  - **Definition**: One of Mieke Bal’s significant contributions to narratology is her detailed analysis of focalization. She distinguishes between the *focalizer* (the agent whose perspective shapes the narrative) and the *focalized* (the object or character being perceived). This distinction allows for a more nuanced analysis of narrative perspective.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Focalizer**:
      - **Definition**: The focalizer is the entity through whose perspective the narrative is presented. This can be a character within the story or an external narrator, influencing how the events and characters are perceived by the reader.
      - **Contextualization**: The concept of the focalizer is crucial for understanding how different viewpoints are constructed within a text. Bal’s framework allows for an exploration of how the focalizer’s perspective shapes the narrative’s tone, bias, and overall interpretation.
    - **Focalized**:
      - **Definition**: The focalized is the object or character being perceived by the focalizer. This distinction helps in analyzing the relationship between the observer and the observed within the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: By distinguishing between the focalizer and the focalized, Bal’s framework enables a deeper exploration of how narratives construct relationships between characters, events, and the reader. It highlights the complexities of narrative perspective and the ways in which different viewpoints can influence the story’s meaning.
