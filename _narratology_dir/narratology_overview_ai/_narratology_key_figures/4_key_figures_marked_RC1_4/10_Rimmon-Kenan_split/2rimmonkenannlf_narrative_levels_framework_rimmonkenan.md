### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Narrative Levels Framework**

- **Narrative Levels**:
  - **Definition**: Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan explores the concept of narrative levels, which refer to the different layers or planes of narration within a story. This includes the distinction between extradiegetic and intradiegetic levels, as well as the phenomenon of metalepsis.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Extradiegetic Level**:
      - **Definition**: The extradiegetic level refers to narration that occurs outside the story world. This is typically the primary level of narration, where the narrator is not a character within the narrative but exists externally to tell the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Understanding the extradiegetic level is essential for analyzing the overarching narrative voice and how it frames the story for the reader.
    - **Intradiegetic Level**:
      - **Definition**: The intradiegetic level refers to narration that occurs within the story world, often involving characters who tell stories within the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: This level adds depth to the narrative by introducing multiple layers of storytelling, each with its own perspective and potential biases.
    - **Metalepsis**:
      - **Definition**: Metalepsis occurs when the boundaries between different narrative levels are transgressed, such as when a character interacts with the narrator or steps outside their narrative world.
      - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan’s exploration of metalepsis highlights the complexity of narrative structure and the ways in which breaking narrative boundaries can create unique effects, challenging the reader’s perception of the story.
