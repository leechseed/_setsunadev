### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Characterization Framework**

- **Characterization**:
  - **Definition**: In her analysis of characterization, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan examines how characters are constructed within narrative fiction. She explores the various methods authors use to present characters, shaping the reader's understanding and engagement with them.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Direct Characterization**:
      - **Definition**: Direct characterization involves explicit description by the narrator or other characters, providing clear information about a characterâ€™s traits, appearance, or background.
      - **Contextualization**: This method offers straightforward insights into a character, but Rimmon-Kenan also encourages readers to consider how these descriptions might be influenced by the narrator's bias or perspective.
    - **Indirect Characterization**:
      - **Definition**: Indirect characterization is conveyed through a character's actions, speech, thoughts, and interactions with others, allowing the reader to infer their qualities.
      - **Contextualization**: Indirect characterization requires more active engagement from the reader, who must piece together clues to form a complete understanding of the character. Rimmon-Kenan highlights how indirect methods can create more complex and multi-dimensional characters.
    - **Narrative Voice and Focalization**:
      - **Definition**: The narrative voice and focalization also play crucial roles in shaping how characters are perceived. The perspective from which a character is presented can significantly affect the reader's interpretation of their actions and motives.
      - **Contextualization**: Analyzing the interplay between narrative voice, focalization, and characterization allows for a deeper understanding of how characters are constructed and how their roles within the narrative are interpreted by the reader.
