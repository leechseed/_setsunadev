### Title: **Genette's Focalization Framework**

- **Focalization**:
  - **Definition**: Focalization refers to the relationship between the narrative and the perspective from which events are perceived. Genette separates the **focus** (what is perceived in the narrative) from the **focalizer** (who perceives the events or experiences them), enabling a more detailed analysis of how information is presented to the reader.
  - **Focus vs. Focalizer**:
    - **Focus**: Refers to the object or content that is being perceived or described in the narrative (the “what”).
    - **Focalizer**: Refers to the entity or character through whose perspective the events are filtered or perceived (the “who”).
  - **Types of Focalization**:
    - **Zero Focalization**: This refers to an omniscient narrator, where the narrator knows more than the characters and can provide a panoramic, all-knowing perspective on the events.
    - **Internal Focalization**: The focalizer is a character within the story, meaning the narrative is limited to what this character knows, experiences, and perceives. This can change throughout the narrative if different characters serve as focalizers.
    - **External Focalization**: The narrator or focalizer perceives only what is observable from the outside, without access to the characters’ inner thoughts or emotions, creating a more detached and objective viewpoint.
  - **Contextualization**:
    - Genette’s distinction between focus and focalizer allows for a more precise analysis of **narrative perspective**, breaking away from traditional classifications of first-person and third-person narration. Instead, focalization focuses on **how much knowledge** is shared with the reader, from **whose point of view** it is shared, and what limitations exist in the character's or narrator's understanding of the events.
    - This concept is essential for understanding how narratives can manipulate the reader's perception, control the flow of information, and create suspense or dramatic irony by strategically limiting or expanding the scope of knowledge within the story.
