# Seymour Chatman's Contributions to Narratology



---

### Title: **Chatman's Story vs. Discourse Framework**

- **Story vs. Discourse**:
  - **Definition**: Seymour Chatman makes a crucial distinction between *story* and *discourse* in his analysis of narrative. This framework is fundamental for understanding how narratives function across different media, particularly in literature and film.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Story**:
      - **Definition**: The story encompasses the events, characters, settings, and actions that constitute the narrative. It represents the raw material of the narrative, existing independently of the way it is presented to the audience.
      - **Contextualization**: The story is the underlying content or "what happens" in the narrative, providing the essential building blocks that can be arranged in various ways to create different narrative effects.
    - **Discourse**:
      - **Definition**: Discourse refers to the structure and technique of how the story is told. It includes the narrative voice, focalization, style, and the medium used (e.g., text, film) to convey the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Discourse is about the "how" of storytelling. It shapes the audience's experience of the story by controlling the presentation of events, the perspective from which they are seen, and the stylistic choices that influence interpretation. Understanding the distinction between story and discourse is key to analyzing narrative strategies and their effects.

### Title: **Chatman's Narrative Communication Model**

- **Narrative Communication**:
  - **Definition**: Seymour Chatman introduces a model of narrative communication that highlights the complex relationships between various agents involved in the creation and reception of a narrative. This model includes the *real author*, *implied author*, *narrator*, *narratee*, *implied reader*, and *real reader*.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Real Author and Implied Author**:
      - **Definition**: The real author is the actual creator of the narrative, while the implied author is the version of the author constructed by the text, embodying the values, style, and intentions inferred by the reader.
      - **Contextualization**: The concept of the implied author allows for a separation between the author's personal identity and the narrative persona created within the text, providing a framework for understanding how narratives guide interpretation.
    - **Narrator and Narratee**:
      - **Definition**: The narrator is the voice that tells the story, while the narratee is the imagined audience within the text to whom the narrator speaks.
      - **Contextualization**: This relationship shapes the narrative's tone, style, and the information that is revealed to the reader, making it crucial for analyzing the dynamics of storytelling.
    - **Implied Reader and Real Reader**:
      - **Definition**: The implied reader is the idealized audience that the narrative seems to address, while the real reader is the actual person engaging with the text.
      - **Contextualization**: The distinction between implied and real readers helps to explore how narratives are crafted to evoke specific responses and how actual readers may interpret texts differently based on their unique perspectives.

### Title: **Chatman's Character and Event Framework**

- **Character and Event**:
  - **Definition**: In *"Story and Discourse,"* Seymour Chatman provides a detailed analysis of characters and events as narrative components. He categorizes characters as either *kernel* or *satellite* characters and distinguishes between *kernels* (major plot events) and *satellites* (minor events).
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Kernel and Satellite Characters**:
      - **Definition**: Kernel characters are essential to the progression of the plot, while satellite characters serve supplementary roles that add depth to the narrative but are not critical to its forward movement.
      - **Contextualization**: This distinction helps in understanding the hierarchical structure of narrative roles and how different characters contribute to the overall development of the story.
    - **Kernel and Satellite Events**:
      - **Definition**: Kernels are major plot events that drive the narrative forward, whereas satellites are minor events that provide additional context or depth without altering the main plot trajectory.
      - **Contextualization**: Understanding the distinction between kernel and satellite events allows for a more nuanced analysis of how narratives are structured and how different events contribute to the pacing and development of the story.

### Title: **Chatman's Time and Space in Narrative Framework**

- **Time and Space in Narrative**:
  - **Definition**: Seymour Chatman explores the manipulation of time and space in narrative discourse, focusing on techniques such as *flashbacks*, *flashforwards*, *ellipsis*, and *summary*.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Temporal Techniques**:
      - **Definition**: Techniques like flashbacks and flashforwards alter the chronological flow of the narrative, while ellipsis and summary compress or expand the narrative time.
      - **Contextualization**: These techniques are essential for controlling the pacing and structure of the narrative, allowing the storyteller to emphasize certain events, create suspense, or provide background information efficiently.
    - **Spatial Techniques**:
      - **Definition**: Spatial manipulation involves the arrangement of narrative elements within the story’s setting, influencing how the audience perceives space and movement within the narrative world.
      - **Contextualization**: In both literary and cinematic narratives, spatial techniques contribute to the immersion of the audience and the overall aesthetic experience of the narrative. Chatman’s analysis of time and space highlights their importance in shaping the audience’s understanding
