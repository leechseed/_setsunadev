THE SOCIAL WORD: BAKHTIN The term intertextuality first enters into the French language in Julia Kristeva’s early work of the middle to late 1960s. In essays such as ‘The Bounded Text’ (Kristeva, 1980: 36–63) and ‘Word, Dialogue, and Novel’ (ibid.:64–91) Kristeva introduces the work of the Russian literary theorist M. M. Bakhtin to the French-speaking world. Bakhtin’s work is, today, extraordinarily influential within the fields of literary theory and criticism, and in linguistics, political and social theory, philosophy and many other disciplines. However, in the 1960s his work was relatively unknown, much of it still unpublished. We have then, in the study of intertextuality, 14 ORIGIN

a highly charged moment of emergence connected directly to Kristeva’s ‘Word, Dialogue, and Novel’ and the related essays she published during this period. Not only does Kristeva coin the term intertextuality, but in doing so she introduces a figure who has since been styled the most important literary theorist of the twentieth century. Intertextuality and the work of Bakhtin are not, that is to say, separable, and in understanding the former we clearly must understand something of the latter. The history of the composition and publication of Bakhtin’s work is complex, fascinating and at times frustrating. Certainly Bakhtin’s life-long insistence that all linguistic communication occurs in specific social situations and between specific classes and groups of language-users is borne out by the impossible tangle of his still hotly debated philosophical and critical oeuvre. I do not intend to go into the disputes over whether Bakhtin authored, co-authored, or did not author the texts of the 1920s: The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship, Freudianism, Marxism and the Philosophy of Language. Nor will I suggest an answer to the thorny question of whether an adherence or resistance to Marxism characterizes his works of the 1930s and beyond. There are now a good number of critical accounts which discuss these topics directly (see Todorov, 1984; Clark and Holquist, 1984; Morris, 1994; Pearce, 1994; Dentith, 1995; Vice, 1997). What we need to bear in mind is that Kristeva’s initial discussions of Bakhtin occurred at a specific historical moment. In our Introduction we noted that the term intertextuality emerged during a period of transition. In the middle to late 1960s in France structuralism was being hotly debated, leading to the emergence of what subsequently has been styled poststructuralism. Kristeva’s work stands beside the work of many other seminal poststructuralist thinkers such as Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault and Louis Althusser. All these theorists worked and wrote in a context, the France of the late 1960s, which was dominated by a political and social crisis culminating in the revolutionary events of 1968. Paris, in 1968, saw a student uprising, temporarily combined with a worker’s uprising, which for a brief time threatened the authority of the French government. In the Russia of the late 1960s and early 1970s the 15 ORIGIN

previous Stalinist censorship of certain formal brands of literary and cultural theory began to fade, and Bakhtin’s works, though themselves fundamentally anti-formalist, were finally being rediscovered, republished or published for the first time. We come to Bakhtin in very different historical and political contexts, and confronting a great deal of work, by Bakhtin and on Bakhtin, unknown to Kristeva in the 1960s. Various languages (Russian, French, English) act as less than neutral channels for the transmission of these contexts and ideas. Our Bakhtin is not Kristeva’s, though her early discussions of his work helped to forge what we now have. From our perspective, Bakhtin can seem less an author from whose works a notion of intertextuality can be derived than a major theorist of intertextuality itself. The starting point for any understanding of Bakhtin and intertextuality must be found in the work of the 1920s. In the book on the Formalist school of Russian literary theory associated with Medvedev (Bakhtin/Medvedev, 1978), and in the books associated with Volosinov (Bakhtin/Volosinov, 1986 and 1987), we find an alternative to the Saussurean theory of language we have just discussed. Whilst Bakhtin/Medvedev recognize the importance of the formalist method in Russian literary theory and practice, they criticize its ‘fear of meaning in art’ (Bakhtin/ Medvedev, 1978: 118). Whilst formalism seeks to explain the general ‘literariness’ of literary works, and Saussurean linguistics seeks to explain language as a synchronic system, what is missed by both approaches is that language exists in specific social situations and is thus bound up with specific social evaluations. Without such an attention to social specificity, argue Bakhtin/Volosinov, in Marxism and the Philosophy of Language, Saussurean linguistics remains something describable as ‘abstract objectivism’. To produce an abstract account of literary language or any language is to forget that language is utilized by individuals in specific social contexts. The crucial word here is utterance, a word which captures the human-centred and socially specific aspect of language lacking in formalism and Saussurean linguistics. As Bakhtin/Medvedev write: Not only the meaning of the utterance but also the very fact of its performance is of historical and social significance, as, in general, is 16 ORIGIN

the fact of its realization in the here and now, in given circumstances, at a certain historical moment, under the conditions of the given social situation. The very presence of the utterance is historically and socially significant. (Bakhtin/Medvedev, 1978: 120) Meaning, Bakhtin/Medvedev argue, is unique, to the extent that it belongs to the linguistic interaction of specific individuals or groups within specific social contexts. It was partly this uniqueness, or infinite potential, of spoken language which led Saussure to focus his analysis of language on langue at the expense of parole and of langage. Langage, a term taken from Saussure, is understood by Bakhtin/Volosinov as ‘language-speech ... the sum total of all manifestations of the verbal faculty’ (Bakhtin/Volosinov, 1986: 59). If parole concerns the act of utterance, then langage concerns every conceivable parole generatable from the system of language (langue). However, as Bakhtin/Volosinov write in Marxism and the Philosophy of Language: Linguistics, as Saussure conceives it, cannot have the utterance as its object of study. What constitutes the linguistic element in the utterance are the normatively identical forms of language present in it. Everything else is ‘accessory and random’. ... language stands in opposition to utterance in the same way as does that which is social to that which is individual. The utterance, therefore, is considered a thoroughly individual entity. (Bakhtin/Volosinov, 1986: 60–61) Saussure, in other words, in order to find some generalizable rules within the study of language, argues that only language in its abstract sense, only the norms and conventions presumed to structure a language at any moment of historical time, can become the object of linguistic study. Such a vision of language (langue) is said by Saussure to provide the possibility for the potentially infinite amount of possible utterances (parole) within that language. And yet, as Bakhtin/Volosinov argue, such an account actually loses sight of the social specificity of language and confines it to something as abstract as a lexicon or dictionary. 17 ORIGIN

As a scholar of Bakhtin, Simon Dentith, writes: ‘Dictionaries are the graveyards of language’ (Dentith, 1995: 24). Bakhtin/Volosinov argue against Saussure that ‘there is no real moment in time when a synchronic system of language could be constructed’ (1986: 66). This is because language is always in a ‘ceaseless flow of becoming’. Language, seen in its social dimension, is constantly reflecting and transforming class, institutional, national and group interests. No word or utterance, from this perspective, is ever neutral. Though the meaning of utterances may be unique, they still derive from already established patterns of meaning recognizable by the addressee and adapted by the addresser. But these established patterns are not the abstract ones of Saussure’s langue, they are rather the manner in which language embodies and reflects constantly changing social values and positions. As Bakhtin/Medvedev put it, the unique discursive event connects to the class relations between addresser and addressee, but also to ‘the more immediate and brief phenomena of social life and, finally, with the news of the day, hour, and minute’ (1978: 121). To say, for example, in 1994 ‘I agree with you completely, not!’ would have seemed (to many) an intelligible sentence, given the popularity of the film Wayne’s World and its characters’ tendency to negate fully articulated statements. Whether such a sentence would be so intelligible in 2022 is less certain. At times, as in the first days after the bombing in August 1998 of the high street in Omagh, Northern Ireland, an event can so dominate collective, social thought that it seems to shadow almost any possible utterance. Aspects of spoken language, like intonation, clearly become important in such dimensions of language-use. The single word ‘well’ or ‘so’, or sounds such as ‘oohh’, lacking in meaning for other varieties of linguistics, can possess many specific meanings when we look at the concrete situation between addresser and addressee in which they are uttered. The most crucial aspect of language, from this perspective, is that all language responds to previous utterances and to preexistent patterns of meaning and evaluation, but also promotes and seeks to promote further responses. One cannot understand an utterance or even a written work as if it were singular in meaning, unconnected to previous and future utterances or works. 18 ORIGIN

No utterance or work, as Bakhtin/Volosinov argue, is independent or what they term ‘monumental’ (1986: 72). From the simplest utterance to the most complex work of scientific or literary discourse, no utterance exists alone. An utterance, such as a scholarly work, may present itself as an independent entity, as monologic (possessing singular meaning and logic), yet it emerges from a complex history of previous works and addresses itself to, seeks for active response from, a complex institutional and social context: peers, reviewers, students, promotion boards and so on. All utterances are dialogic, their meaning and logic dependent upon what has previously been said and on how they will be received by others. The abstract linguistics of Saussure strips language of its dialogic nature, which includes its social, ideological, subject-centred and subject-addressed nature. Bakhtin/Volosinov summarize as follows: Language acquires life and historically evolves ... in concrete verbal communication, and not in the abstract linguistic system of language, nor in the individual psyche of speakers. (Bakhtin/Volosinov, 1986: 95) If words, for Bakhtin, Medvedev and Volosinov, are relational, it is not simply because of their place within an abstract system of language, but because of the nature of all language viewed in its concrete social situatedness. All utterances are responses to previous utterances and are addressed to specific addressees. It is this addressivity of the word and utterance, as Bakhtin will later term it, which must be the central focus of the study of language. As Bakhtin/Volosinov argue: Orientation of the word towards the addressee has an extremely high significance. In point of fact, word is a two-sided act. It is determined equally by whose word it is and for whom it is meant. As word, it is precisely the product of the reciprocal relationship between speaker and listener, addresser and addressee. Each and every word expresses ‘one’ in relation to the ‘other’. I give myself verbal shape from another’s point of view, ultimately, from the point of view of the community to which I belong. A word is a bridge thrown between myself and 19 ORIGIN

another. If one end of the bridge depends on me, then the other depends upon my addressee. A word is territory shared by both addresser and addressee, by the speaker and his interlocutor. (ibid.: 86) Lynne Pearce’s reference to telephone conversations is a useful example of this argument about language (Pearce, 1994: 1–6). In telephone conversations, which take place between speakers unable to interpret physical signs, the nature of the intonations used, or the kinds of words employed, is crucial in establishing the meaning of the communicative act. Overhearing someone else’s telephone conversation is often such a confusing experience because the dialogic nature of the conversation involved can only fully be understood by those participants who in effect are creating it. The manner in which I address my lover, my colleague, my bank manager will vary immensely in intonation and in what Bakhtin would later call speech genre. I will employ different phrases when speaking or writing to such different addressees, partly because they will expect the use of appropriate speech genres. ‘Re. your letter of the 14th’ is a fine opening for a letter to one’s bank manager, but hardly appropriate in a letter home to one’s parents. ‘Hello darling!’ might be a perfectly acceptable way in which to greet a close friend; one would hardly employ it in a formal introduction to a local dignitary. The words we select in any specific situation have an ‘otherness’ about them: they belong to specific speech genres, they bear the traces of previous utterances. They are also directed towards specific ‘others’, specific addressees. As Bakhtin writes, in his essay on speech genres: The speaker is not the biblical Adam, dealing only with virgin and still unnamed objects, giving them names for the first time. ... In reality ... any utterance, in addition to its own theme, always responds (in the broad sense of the word) in one form or another to others’ utterances that precede it. The speaker is not Adam, and therefore the subject of his speech itself inevitably becomes the arena where his opinions meet those of his partners (in a conversation or dispute about some everyday event) or other viewpoints, world views, trends, theories, and so forth (in the sphere of cultural communication). World views, 20 ORIGIN

trends, viewpoints, and opinions always have verbal expression. All this is others’ speech (in personal or impersonal form), and cannot but be reflected in the utterance. The utterance is addressed not only to its object, but also to others’ speech about it. (Bakhtin, 1986: 93–94) It is this sense of the otherness of language which explains Bakhtin’s most important concept, dialogism, and begins to demonstrate that concept’s intertextual nature.
