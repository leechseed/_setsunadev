## Compendium of Key Concepts, Theories, and Figures in Cognitive Psychology

### Overview
This compendium serves as a reference guide to the fundamental concepts, theories, and key figures in the field of Cognitive Psychology. It is designed to provide students, researchers, and practitioners with quick access to the essential ideas and pioneers who have shaped the understanding of human cognition.

### Concepts
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: A psychological theory that explains the discomfort and stress that arise when a person holds contradictory beliefs or values, or when their beliefs are challenged by new information.
- **Memory**: The processes by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. Memory is often segmented into working memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.
- **Perception**: The process of organizing, identifying, and interpreting sensory information to represent and understand the environment.

### Theories
- **Dual-Process Theory**: Proposes that there are two distinct systems for processing information: System 1, which is fast, automatic, and emotional; and System 2, which is slower, more deliberate, and more logical.
- **Information Processing Theory**: Views the human mind as a system that processes incoming information, comparing it to a computer. It focuses on the ways information is processed over stages, including attention, perception, and storage.

### Key Figures
- **Jean Piaget**: Known for his pioneering work in developmental psychology. Piaget's theory of cognitive development suggests that children move through four stages of mental development, emphasizing the role of schema, assimilation, and accommodation.
- **Daniel Kahneman**: A psychologist famous for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making, as well as behavioral economics. Kahneman's insights into System 1 and System 2 processing have heavily influenced cognitive psychology.
- **Elizabeth Loftus**: Renowned for her research on human memory, especially in the context of eyewitness testimony and the malleability of human memory in the face of misleading information.

### Usage
This compendium is intended as a quick-reference guide. Users are encouraged to delve deeper into specific entries using the detailed references and suggested readings provided for each concept, theory, and figure.

### Conclusion
The field of Cognitive Psychology is vast and complex, with ongoing research that continues to refine our understanding of the human mind. This compendium provides a foundational overview, intended to support further exploration and study.
