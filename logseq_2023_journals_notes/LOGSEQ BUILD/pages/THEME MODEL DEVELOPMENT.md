- ## THEMATIC MODEL CONCEPTS
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664367297632_0.png)
		- Universal Theme Model 1.0 demonstrates the reduction methodology of going from Topos to Controlling Idea.
	- ### Controlling Idea Equation
		- *Controlling Idea* is how theme applied to narrative design.
		- ### $$ \alpha + \beta = \Chi $$
		- \alpha = Value (Topos)
		- \beta = Cause (Theme)
		- \Chi = Controlling Idea
	- #### Dramatic Question Equation
		- *Dramatic Question* is using the controlling idea to form a question which is answered by the narrative premise.
		- $$(\Chi + ? = \oslash    )$$
			- \Chi = Controlling Idea
			- ? = Framing as a Question
			- \oslash    = Dramatic Question
	- #### Narrative Premise Equation
		- *Narrative Premise* is answering the *Dramatic Question*
		- $$\lambda  =  \frac{\oslash}{\ \Diamond }  $$
		- \lambda   = Narrative Premise
		- \oslash = Dramatic Question
		- \Diamond = Story
		-
	- ## High-Resolution Narrative Pitch Equation
		- $$\lambda =  \frac{ \alpha + \beta + ?}{\Diamond}$$
		- Putting all the elements of Theme together, we get a *high-resolution narrative pitch*
		- #### Narrative Pitch
			- A story's basic description
		- ### High-Resolution Narrative Pitch
			- A very well designed narrative pitch.
				- Designed using principles discovered in Theme Studies.
			- The basis of *Creative Discipline*
				- Becomes the *Creative Discipline Statement*
					- The statement which empowers the decision making capability of creative discipline.
	- ## THEME-2-DEVSTATE FLOW MODEL
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664370378659_0.png)
		- *DEVSTATE* - The step of narrative development where the first two forms of documentation have been created. EG: High-Resolution Narrative Pitch and Creative Discipline Statement
	- ## Example of T2D Flow Model in Use
