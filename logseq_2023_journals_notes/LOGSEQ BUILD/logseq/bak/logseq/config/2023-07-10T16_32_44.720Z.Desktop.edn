 ;; Specify a custom CSS import
 ;; This option take precedence over your local `logseq/custom.css` file
 ;; You may find a list of awesome logseq themes here:

 ;; Example:

 ;; When :all-pages-public? true, export repo would export all pages within that repo.
 ;; Regardless of whether you've set any page to public or not.
 ;; Example:
 ;; :publishing/all-pages-public? true

 ;; Specify default home page and sidebar status for Logseq
 ;; If not specified, Logseq default opens journals page on startup
 ;; value for `:page` is name of page
 ;; Possible options for `:sidebar` are
 ;; 1. `"Contents"` to open up `Contents` in sidebar by default
 ;; 2. `page name` to open up some page in sidebar
 ;; 3. Or multiple pages in an array ["Contents" "Page A" "Page B"]
 ;; If `:sidebar` is not set, sidebar will be hidden
 ;; Example:
 ;; 1. Setup page "Changelog" as home page and "Contents" in sidebar
 ;; :default-home {:page "Changelog", :sidebar "Contents"}
 ;; 2. Setup page "Jun 3rd, 2021" as home page without sidebar
 ;; :default-home {:page "Jun 3rd, 2021"}
 ;; 3. Setup page "home" as home page with multiple pages in sidebar
 ;; :default-home {:page "home" :sidebar ["page a" "page b"]}

 ;; Tell logseq to use a specific folder in the repo as a default location for journals
 ;; if not specified, journals are stored in `journals` directory
 ;; :journals-directory "your-directory"

 ;; Set this to true will convert
 ;; `[[Grant Ideas]]` to `[[file:./grant_ideas.org][Grant Ideas]]` for org-mode
 ;; For more, see https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/672
 ;; :org-mode/insert-file-link? true

 ;; If you prefer to use the file name as the page title
 ;; instead of the first heading's title
 ;; the only option for now is `file`
 ;; :page-name-order "file"

 ;; Setup custom shortcuts under `:shortcuts` key
 ;; Syntax:
 ;; 1. `+` means keys pressing simultaneously. eg: `ctrl+shift+a`
 ;; 2. ` ` empty space between keys represents key chords. eg: `t s` means press `s` follow by `t`
 ;; 3. `mod` means `Ctrl` for Windows/Linux  and `Command` for Mac
 ;; 4. use `false` to disable particular shortcut
 ;; 4. you can define multiple bindings for one action, eg `["ctrl+j" "down"]`
 ;; full list of configurable shortcuts are available below:
 ;; https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/master/src/main/frontend/modules/shortcut/config.cljs
