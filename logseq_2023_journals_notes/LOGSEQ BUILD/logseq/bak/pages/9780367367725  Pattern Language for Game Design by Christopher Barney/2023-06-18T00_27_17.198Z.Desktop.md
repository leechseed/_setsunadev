	  collapsed:: true
		- What is this book, then? It’s a book of exercises that will help you orga-
		  nize your understanding of design into a language that you can use to cre-
		  ate games.
		- This book does not provide a Pattern Language for game design. Instead,
		  it ofers a series of exercises for you to complete. Each one gives you a dif-
		  ferent way to create a pattern. Once you’ve worked your way through this
		  book, you can select the exercise that’s best suited for any design prob-
		  lem you face, and complete it again to generate new patterns that ft your
		  design needs.
		- Over time, you’ll link all of the patterns you create to build
		  your own Pattern Language. Tis book contains only 24 exercises, but
		  using them you can discover hundreds of patterns.
		- This book encourages the development of a personal Pattern Language that is what you, as a developer, need.
		- The process of generating patterns through the exercises in this book forces you to think deeply about the mechanics and techniques used in the games you observe.
		- The exercises will help you understand the purpose behind those techniques, to see beyond their surface-level effects.

	- # 2 - Background on *A Pattern Language* by Christopher Alexander
	  collapsed:: true
		- > Our world can be understood as if it were interwoven by conscious and unconscious patterns, whereby each pattern is linked to other patterns. (Leitner 2020)
		- >While pattern theory originates in architecture, it is a general theory of development (of change, of transformation, of unfolding, of the creative process) and, as such, is relevant to almost every feld of application, even for the very complex and for social systems. (Leitner 2015)
		- All of this ties to the exercises in this book, which let you create a Pattern Language for games based on the patterns that you see. How you assess those patterns, which ones you see as “good” and which you see as “bad,” will be based on who you are, your experience playing games, your current design skills, and what you want players to get out of the games you design.
		- One of the most valid points raised against the work in A Pattern Language applies strongly to game design: the criticism that Alexander drew entirely from Western architectural tradition as a source for his patterns.
		- It is critical to understand the people that you are building for and to note as part of your patterns how tied to a specifc location or society they are.
		- In game terms, we must be aware of our audience both as we distill patterns and as we apply them.

		- ## Computer Science
			- > The real reason that common patterns are not used rather than tight abstractions is efficiency. It is more efficient to write abstracted, compressed code than uncompressed common patterns, and it is more efficient to execute abstracted code in some cases.
			- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Gamma et al. 1994.) The authors of this book, often referred to as the “Gang of Four,” combined their considerable collective experience and looked at a presumably vast amount of object-oriented code to produce a set of well-defined, useful patterns.
			- The fundamental problem is that they are not design patterns; they are techniques that repeated across many designs.
			- They are useful in understanding how to structure aspects of that code in a functional way, but they lack the two qualities required to be patterns in the Alexandrian sense: they do not address specific design problems, and they do not have the structure of a language needed to produce whole designs.
		- ## Social and Behavioral Science
			- The most exciting outcome came from a group working on a Pattern Language for creative learning.
			- Their process consists of five steps: Pattern Mining, Pattern Prototyping, Pattern Writing, Language Organizing, and Catalogue Editing. The process is focused on providing a framework to generate a language needed by a subject area and produces a language document ready for publication.
			- The techniques you will learn in the following sections are focused on the process of creating a personal language. The language may find broad use, but its intended value is the understanding you gain by creating it.
	- # 4 - Background on the Use of Patterns in Game Design
	  collapsed:: true
		- > Unlike most design patterns we have chosen not to define patterns as pure problem/solution pairs. Tis is due to two observations. First, defining patterns from problems creates a risk of viewing patterns as a method for only removing unwanted effects of a design. In other words, using patterns as a tool for problem-solving only and not as a tool to support creative design work. (Bjoörk et al. 2003)
		- misunderstanding what Alexander meant by “problem.”
		- > Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice. (Alexander 1977)
		- The problem he was referring to was not a specific defect in a design that needed a solution, but the desired outcome of the design that needed a solution.
		- Design patterns allow you to build on that experience without going through a long learning period yourself.
		- to create assets that are in line with the theme, narrative design, and mechanical design, all disciplines must be engaging with the same design language.
		- For any Pattern Language to be complete enough to be useful, it must start at a high enough level to encompass each of those areas. Even for a design team divided into those areas, such a language would be necessary for those teams to best work together.
		- there is no statement of when or why creating a flow state is desirable. The implication that all games should produce this state is demonstrably false.
		- Te slow pace of a narrative game is not conducive to a fow state, and yet the games are immersive, compelling, and successful in their goals as games.

	  collapsed:: true
		- ## The Pattern Template
			- This template represents a synthesis of the work of other designers in applying patterns to game design and my experience in using patterns to teach design.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1685719364565_0.png) ![image.png](../assets/image_1685719405537_0.png){:height 723, :width 540} ![image.png](../assets/image_1685719429087_0.png)
			- > What is a design problem? The design problem that is addressed by a pattern should describe a situation you face as a designer. A design problem is not simply the effect of a mechanic stated as a question. It must capture the purpose and intent of the designer not just mechanically but in terms of its effect on the player. In this way, a well-constructed pattern will ensure that you are designing games that intentionally create an experience for the player. If this seems abstract, look over some of the design problems in the example patterns provided for each exercise.
		- ## Pattern Confidence
			- All patterns start with a confidence rating of 0, then add 1 for each of the following items that apply.
			- Some of the items are related and “stack.” For example, a Common Pattern (+1) would also have to meet the requirements for being a Limited Pattern (+1) and a Singular Pattern (+1) for a total of 3. You should apply all the applicable labels. So if you had used this hypothetical pattern and another developer had independently described the same pattern, you would also apply Demonstrated Pattern” (+1) and Independent Sources (+1) for a total confidence score of 5.
			- **(+0) Theoretical Pattern**: The Theoretical Patterns exercise (Exercise 24) generates this type of pattern. You might also create a theoretical pattern by adapting a pattern from an existing repository that doesn’t cite example games. This pattern may be valid, but you don’t generate it from observation. Instead, you create it by imagining how a theory about game design would fit the pattern format.
			- **(+1) Single Example Pattern:** This level of confidence comes from a pattern that was generated based on one example. It’s entirely possible to look at a single game and derive a valid pattern from it. However, it can be challenging to determine whether what you see is an actual pattern or just the results of a design technique or element that would yield a different pattern if you looked at its use across many games.
			- **(+1) Limited Pattern**: If you’ve observed the pattern in fewer than ten games, it’s a limited pattern. If you have a hard time providing the ten examples in an exercise, this level of confidence may result.
			- **(+1) Common Pattern**: The pattern is visible in at least ten games, probably many more. You have found a “common pattern” when you stop recording examples at ten but could go on, and it’s a good sign that you’ve done an excellent job formulating a pattern based on your observations.
			- **(+1) Demonstrated Pattern**: A pattern is a demonstrated pattern if you, or another developer, have used it in development, and the effect was as intended.
			- **(+1) Validated Pattern**: This confidence level describes a pattern that’s in common use among a variety of game developers and has been proven effective through widespread use. At the time of the printing of this book, it’s probably not possible to find a pattern validated through use. As you work with patterns throughout your career, it may become more common. A pattern might also be a validated pattern if you conducted empirical user
			  research to show that the pattern was effective.
			- (+1) Independent Sources: If more than one developer derives a pat-tern, it has independent sources. In teaching, it’s common to discover this kind of pattern as more than one group of students arrives at the same pat-tern from different starting points. As the community of developers using the exercises in this book increases and shares patterns, this will become more common.
		- ## Example Pattern
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1685719986575_0.png) ![image.png](../assets/image_1685720005608_0.png) ![image.png](../assets/image_1685720020114_0.png)
			- Initially, when you are creating a pattern, you leave the last three items blank. You may not be able to identify parent and child relationships when you first complete the pattern, because you will have such a small set of patterns. As you develop more patterns, you will add these fields when you recognize that two of your patterns are connected.
		- ## Introduction to Pattern Exercises
			- As you work through this book, I encourage you to do the exercises in order. They build in complexity and specificity, and passing through all of them once will give you the start of a structure for the language you will develop from them
			- Once you have completed the exercises once to build the foundation of your language, you will be comfortable with the process.
			- ==Each pattern exercise in this book consists of a set of steps.== They begin with a framing task/question: **name a functional design element**, or **pick a mechanic from a boss encounter**, or **choose an emotional effect**.
			- You are then usually asked to list, through research or experience, a set of games that match the design element you’ve chosen.
			- You then analyze those games and how they achieve the effect you observed in them.
			- You need to describe what you see in some detail, again avoiding using only one or two keywords.
			- It’s surprising what insights you can get when you force yourself to describe precisely the thing that seems evident to you.
			- Next, you will look at the games you’ve analyzed and see if you observe any patterns. The exercises ask you to find ten games. Tat number is arbitrary; it is both too large for many new designers and far too small to generate indisputable patterns.
			- However, listing ten games will force you to look at edge cases and pick at least a few games that were not immediately obvious to you. These games will help you understand the scope of your pattern.
			- Tese exercises help you fnd and defne potential patterns. Don’t think that because you were able to complete an exercise that the pattern you have observed is true in some fundamental way
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1685720361278_0.png)
			- ### Step 1: Name a Design Element
				- A tall structure, visible from many points in the game world.
				- `The first step, name a design element, is intentionally vague. It will allow you to apply this exercise to virtually any design problem. However, it doesn’t give much guidance for you to focus the pattern in any particular way. Tat makes this a good exercise for creating general, broadly applicable patterns.`
			- ### Step 2: What problem(s) does that design element solve?
				- A. Architectural weenies help motivate and facilitate the player’s exploration of the world. These are two related but distinct functions. I suspect that there are child patterns* related to each.
				  B. Architectural weenies may create an iconic image or location to set the tone of the game, such as the Great Tree in Ori and the Blind Forest or the glowing mountain in Journey.
				  C. They can also create a narrative focus for the game, e.g., Death Mountain in many Zelda games or the White-Gold Tower in the Imperial City in The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.
				- `The next question, What problem(s) does that design element solve?, is intended to get the designer to start thinking about what purposes design elements serve. It’s crucial to think carefully and identify actual design problems, rather than just restating the mechanic. For instance, if the design element were “jumping,” it would not exist to solve the problem of “letting the player jump.” Instead, perhaps “allowing dynamic traversal” or, better yet, “increasing player autonomy by creating more dynamic movement options.”`
			- ### Step 3: Pick one of the problems you Identified
				- A. Motivating and facilitating the player’s exploration of the world.
				- `In this case, I identified three effects that might be created by an architectural weenie. I chose the first one to explore in the rest of the exercise.`
				- `The next step asks you to name at least ten games that solve the same problem as the design element you chose rather than ten games that use that same design element.`
				- `Exercise 1: Basic Pattern Exercise looks at the design element directly`
				- `Exercise 2: Higher-Order Patterns looks at the problems solved by the design element.`
				- `Focusing on the problems allows the exercise to uncover more fundamental patterns by looking at the underlying purpose of the design element rather than the element itself. The phrase “higher order” here is about zooming out just a little, going from narrower to broader, from specific to more general.`
			- ### Step 4: List and describe ten games that also solve the same problem in as many diverse ways as possible
				- Journey, Grand Theft Auto, Assassins Creed, Skyrim, Bastion, Dear
				  Esther, The Secret World, Draugen, Anthem, The Room
				- `Question 4 is relatively simple, but probably requires the most time to complete. In this case, how do Journey, Grand Theft Auto, etc. motivate player exploration.`
				- `If you don’t, you may end up converging back to a pattern that just describes the technique you began with.`
				- `The goal of this exercise, in terms of the example, is not to describe architectural weenies but to understand the higher-level, more fundamental pattern that they express.`
			- ### Step 5: Describe the way each game solves the design problem. Focus on each game and try *not* to start looking for patterns as you write
				- *Journey*—The mountain in the distance in Journey gives you a
				  sense of direction and has a visually compelling, unexplained
				  light shining from its top.
				- *Journey*—The ruins that you can see in the near distance
				  throughout the game stand out from the initial desert land-
				  scape, offering direction; when you get close, you can see the
				  embedded narrative of the partial murals on the ruin walls.
				- *Grand Theft Auto*—There’s a map showing where it’s possible
				  to go, but the map is incomplete, which gives you a limited set
				  of short-term goals and teases future quests with the negative
				  space on the map.
				- *Assassin’s Creed*—The landscape you move through as you
				  play contains many high towers. Given the game’s climbing
				  mechanics, they are attractive locations. The quest map is filled
				  in by showing more and more possible quest objectives with
				  each tower you reach.
				- *Skyrim* (and many Elder Scrolls games)—The Icons that appear on
				  the compass indicating points of interest provide immediate directions for exploration. They show you what kind of quest you will
				  encounter by going in a direction, but don’t give you any details.
				- *Bastion*—The world around the character is very limited but
				  forms continuously as you move so that every action results in
				  more of the world’s secrets revealing themselves.
				- *Dear Esther*—There’s no apparent direction or goal at the
				  beginning of the game, but you have only a few paths you can
				  follow. As you move, you hear and see narrative snippets that
				  raise more questions than they answer.
				- *The Secret World*—One activity you can do in this massively
				  multiplayer online game (MMO) is collecting “Lore” snippets,
				  which appear as visually distinct hovering items in the game
				  world. Each one contains a bit of a story, but you usually fnd
				  them out of order.
				- *Draugen*—The world constantly presents appealing but inaccessible exploration options; most become available as the
				  game progresses.
				- *Anthem*—Much of the drive to explore comes from enticing vistas and collectible narrative items. But you also need
				  resources, and exploring is the best way to get them in the early
				  part of the game.
				- *The Room*—Tis mobile game presents you with one strange
				  puzzle box after another, and you’re always given just enough
				  information to open it, but rarely any information about what
				  you’ll find when you do. The game narratively implies occult
				  mysteries at every opportunity.
				- `The next question is probably the hardest. Here I ask for you to look for patterns. It is entirely possible, though unlikely, that no patterns exist for you to find. It's also possible that several or even many patterns may be present. In this case, I just list a single aspect that example games share.`
				-
			- ### Step 6: What do those solutions have in common? The solutions may have more than one thing in common. Some games may share one, and other games share another. List and describe each.
				- They all provide the player with partial information.
				- `If I had listen more than one property that the games had in common, I would have listed each here and considered whether each was related to the others.`
				- ``Finally, I ask you to articulate the pattern that you've observed. The response usually comes in the form of a short paragraph. In the next step you fill out the Pattern Template using the answers you gave all in the preceding steps.``
			- ### Step 7: Is there a pattern? Briefly describe it. Do not create a formal description using the Pattern Template; just make the first attempt to articulate what you see.
				- `It’s important to note that the Example Games section of the
				  Pattern Template is not asking for the games from question 4 of the
				  Pattern Exercise, which asked for ten games that solved the design
				  problem in different ways. It’s asking for ten games that implement
				  the pattern as you have identified it in question 7 of the exercise
				  where you articulated the pattern. These may or may not be the same
				  games, and, in fact, easily finding additional games that implement
				  the pattern is a sign that the pattern is a good one.`
				- `It's important to note that the Example Games section of the Pattern Template is not asking for the games from question 4 of the Pattern Exercise, which asked for ten games that solved the design problem in different ways.`
				- `It's asking for ten games that implement the pattern as you ahve identified it in question 7 of the exercise where you articulated the pattern.`
				- `These may or may not be the same games, and, in fact, easily finding additional games that implement the pattern is a sign that the patter is a good one.`
			- ### Step 8: For each problem you identified in step 2, you may repeat steps 3-7
				- `If I wished, I could have returned to step 2 and looked for patterns related to the other two design problems that I listed there.`

	- # 6 - Principles of Good Pattern Design
		- ## 1 Patterns Should Address a Design Problem
			- *“In order to y, designers may wish to x.”*
		- ## 2 Avoid Shallow Patterns
			- It’s not enough to just look at what a game does.
			- When analyzing a game, that’s an example of your pattern; it’s essential to look at why it’s doing what you say it’s doing.
		- ## 3  Do Not Create Circular Patterns
			- Check to see if your pattern is in the format:
			- *“To do x you should create a game that does x.”*
			- If it is, your pattern is circular.
		- ## 4  Patterns Should Be Prescriptive
			- *To create situations where players can explore the identities of their characters in an RPG, designers may create situations where the character’s actions will have important but easily identified and contained effects on the game world.*

		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686915945178_0.png)
	- ### Formal Pattern
		- Patterns that are considered the structural forms of the game. Dude this guy is so fucking retarded. Higher order? Formal? like dude doens't describe shit.
		- Focuses on Systemic patterns that **centered around the world that the player exists in**
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686915926627_0.png)
	- ### Functional Pattern
		- Purpose: Patterns that require interaction of a user, consider *-ing* verbs
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686915904228_0.png)
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686915911859_0.png)
	- ### Emotional Pattern
		- Purpose: Emotional effects that are incited by the game using interaction unique to video games.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686915887283_0.png)
	- ### Player Experience Pattern
		- Purpose: Patterns that shape player experience
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686916051299_0.png)
	- ### Theme Genre Pattern
		- Purpose: Aesthetic Genre
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686916099818_0.png)
	- ### Circulation Patterns
		- Purpose: To Identify **Gameplay Loops** that players act upon in a macro, micro, and meta sense.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686916237846_0.png)
	- ### Boss Encounter Patterns
		- Purpose: Focuses on Boss Encounters
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686916279765_0.png)
	- ### Emergent Narrative Patterns
		- Purpose: Story beats that are created by player interaction with game systems, then joined into a coherent narrative in the player's mind.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686916326887_0.png)
	- ### Embedded and Environmental Narrative Patterns
		- Purpose: This fucking retard says they're the same but different. They're different but they use the same pattern HUH? fucking idiot
		- **Environmental Narrative Patterns**
			- Purpose: Environmental elements and assets assembled in the game world when observed by the player create a meta-narrative within the space that the player exists. It is not required for the user to interact with these environmental narrative patterns to fulfil requirements of the story.
		- **Embedded Narrative Patterns**
			- Purpose: Diegetic elements that are placed within the game world with specific intent to forward the narrative of the game. The user must interact with an embedded narrative pattern to fulfill the requirements of the story, unlike the environmental narrative patterns.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686916621047_0.png)
	- ### Breaking Spaces Patterns
		- Purpose: Locus of Play - understanding the meta-cognitive/physical spaces in which users play the game, and how games shift from one medium to another. Highly related to the intertextual hypermediated nature of videogames such as *Fortnight*
