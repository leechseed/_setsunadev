		- ### STORY AND LIFE
			- **Personal Story** - an understructured, slice-of-life portraiture that mistakes verisimilitude for truth.
			- **Big T Truth** - located behind, beyond, inside, below the surface of things, holding reality together or tearing it apart, and cannot be directly observed

- # PART 2 - THE ELEMENTS OF STORY
	- ## 2 THE STRUCTURE SPECTRUM
		- ### THE TERMINOLOGY OF STORY DESIGN
		- ### STRUCTURE
			- **Structure** - a selection of events from the characters' life stories that is composed into a strategic sequence to arouse specific emotions to express a specific view of life
			- **Event** - caused by or affects people, thus delineating characters; it takes place in a setting, generating image, action, and dialogue; it draws energy from conflict producing emotion in characters and audience alike.
			- **Design of Events** - needs a dual strategy
			- ### Event
				- **Event**- means change
				- **Story Event** - creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a Value and achieved through conflict
				- **Story Values** - the universal qualities of human experience that may shift from positive to negative, or negative to positive from one moment to the next
			- #### Beat
				- **Beat** - an exchange of behavior in action/reaction. Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene
			- #### Scene
				- **Scene** - an action through conflict in continuous time and space that turns the value-charged condition of a character's life on at least one value with a degree of perceptible significance.
				- **Scene Evaluation** - What value is at stake in my character's life at the moment? How is the value charged at the top of the scene? How is that value charged at the end of the scene? If the value charged condition of the character's life stays unchanged from one end of the scene to the other, nothing meaningful happens
				- **The Ideal Scene**- No scene that doesn't turn
				- **Action Genres** - turn on public values such as freedom/slavery or justice/injustice
				- **Education Genre** - turns interior values such as self-awareness/self-deception or life as meaningful/meaningless
				- **The Universal Principle of Scene** - If a scene is not a true event, cut it
			- #### Sequence
				- **Sequence** - a series of scenes--generally two to five--that culminates with greater impact than any previous scene
			- #### Act
				- **Act** - a series of sequences that peaks in a climactic scene which uses a major reversal of values, more powerful than previous acts
			- #### Story
				- **Story** - a series of acts, the largest story structure
				- **Story Climax** - a story concept that  serves the purpose of absolute irreversible change
		- ### THE STORY TRIANGLE
			- **Plotting** - the writer's choice of events and their design in time
			- #### Archplot, Miniplot, Antiplot
				- **Classical Design** - a story built around an active protagonist who struggles against primarily external forces of antagonism to pursue his or her desire, through continuous time, within a consistent and causally connected fictional reality, to a closed ending of absolute irreversible change.
				- **Minimalism** - the writer reduces the elements of Classical Design--shrinking or compressing, trimming or truncating the prominent features of the Archplot
				- **Miniplot** - the set of compressed features found in minimalist plot design
				- **Antiplot**- the rejection of classical design
		- ### FORMAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE STORY TRIANGLE
			- **Closed Versus Open Endings**
				- **Closed Ending**- a Story Climax of absolute, irreversible change that answers all questions raised by the telling and satisfies all audience emotion
				- **Open Ending**- a Story Climax that leaves a question or two unanswered and some emotion unfulfilled
			- **External Versus Internal Conflict**
			- **Single Versus Multiple Protagonists**
				- **Classically Told Story** - a story in which a single protagonist--man, woman, or child--at the heart of the telling
			- **Active Versus Passive Protagonist**
				- **Active Protagonist** - in the pursuit of desire, takes action in direct conflict with the people and the world around him
				- **Passive Protagonist** - outwardly inactive while pursuing desire inwardly, in conflict with aspects of his or her own nature.
			- **Linear Versus Nonlinear Time**
				- **Linear Time**- a story with or without flashbacks and arranged into a temporal order of events that the audience can follow
				- **Nonlinear Time** - a story that either skips helter-skelter through time or so blurs temporal continuity that the audience cannot sort out what happens before and after what is told
			- **Causality Versus Coincidence**
				- **Causality** - drives a story in which motivated actions cause effects that in turn become the causes of yet other effects, thereby interlinking the various levels of conflict in a chain reaction of episodes to the Story Climax, expressing the interconnectedness of reality
				- **Coincidence** - drives a fictional world in which unmotivated actions trigger events that do not cause further effects, and therefore fragment the story into divergent episodes and an open ending, expressing the disconnectedness of existence.
			- **Consistent Versus Inconsistent Realities**
				- **Archplot**- a consistent reality in which plot evolves; a set of laws that cannot be broken regardless of rationality
				- **Consistent Realities** - fictional settings that establish modes of interaction between characters and their world that are kept consistently throughout the telling to create meaning
				- **Inconsistent Realities** - settings that mix modes of interaction so that the story's episodes jump inconsistently from one 'reality' to another to create  a sense of absurdity'
				- **Antiplot** - the opposite of an archplot, the only rule is to break the rules
			- **Change Versus Stasis**
				- **Miniplot** - change that occurs in a character's deepest level of inner conflict
				- **Nonplot** - story dissolved into portraiture, either a portrait of verisimilitude or one of absurdity
		- ### THE POLITICS OF STORY DESIGN
			- #### The Writer Must Earn His Living Writing
				- **Most Humans Believe** - life brings closed experiences of absolute irreversible change; the greatest source of conflict are external to themselves; the main character is themselves and are the single and only active protagonist of their own existence; their existence operates through the continuous time within a consistent, casually interconnected reality; within the reality events happen for explainable and meaningful reasons
				- **Classical Design** - a model of memory and anticipation
			- #### The Writer Must Master Classical Form
				- **The History of Art** - a revolution of revivals: Establishment icons are shattered by avant-garde, in time becomes the new establishment, and is then shattered by another avant-garde similar to the original establishment
				- **Classical Anticipation** - The passive behavior in which humans universally express when encountering a story for the first time.
			- #### The Writer Must Believe in What He Writes
				- **Stanislavski** - every aspect of storytelling must be pursued with passionate conviction
				- **Edmund Husserl's Objective Correlative** - a story is the embodiment of our own ideas and passions; the feelings and insights we wish to instill in the audience
				- **McKee's Poetic Politic** - write only what you believe

			- #### STRUCTURE AND CHARACTER FUNCTIONS
				- **Progressive Structure** - based on the principle of creative limitation; this literary element  states that the writer must mindfully escalate the main character's proximity to danger and risk of annihilation levels from nominal to over 9000; use of this element will yield a cascading reaction resulting in a character revelation
