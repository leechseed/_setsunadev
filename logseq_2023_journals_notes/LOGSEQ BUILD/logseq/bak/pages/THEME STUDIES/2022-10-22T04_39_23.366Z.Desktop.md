	- McKee refers to theme as a **controlling idea**
	  id:: 63339c5c-b785-4ba8-8796-20deadcc9b64
		- **controlling idea** - a single sentence describing how and why life undergoes change from one condition of existence at the beginning to another.
		- **creative discipline** - a principle to guide aesthetic choices toward what is appropriate or inappropriate for your story.
		- The more solid and finite your controlling idea, the more singular, and clear, the more rich the story becomes.
			- subtexts
			- conceits
			- double meanings
			- richness
	- ### The controlling idea has two components: Value plus Cause.
	  id:: 63339c5c-dc20-4de7-b701-5788e89f0091
		- The controlling idea is a sentence composed of these two elements.

	  >A good story is literal in the same sense that a child’s
	  drawing is literal. When a child draws, he doesn’t
	  intend to distort but to set down exactly what he sees,
	  and as his gaze is direct, he sees the lines that create
	  motion. Now the lines of motion that interest the
	  writer are usually invisible. They are the lines of
	  spiritual motion. And in this story you should be on
	  the lookout for such things as the action of grace in
	  the Grandmother’s soul, and not for the dead bodies. 
	  -Flannery O'Connor

		- EG: *Harmony*
	- *A symphony is vastly more than a sum of its parts; but an expression of the original musician's desire to express certain emotional elements through sound.*
	- *Theme is the melody of a piece of music.*
	- *Theme evolves, devolves, grows, and develops as the song plays through time.*
	- ~~*Let theme drive plot*~~
		- Not so sure about this.
		- Theme should drive crucial decisions, dilemmas, and escalating transitions within the narrative structure.
		- It should not *control* every aspect of the plot.
		- Semantics. But semantics are important. Perhaps a better way to phrase theme in regards to plot is to refer to theme as *signal indicators* or *checkpoints* that exist within the narrative structure to prevent *plot drift.*)

	- Theme is knowledge.
	  id:: 63339c5c-6322-47f0-bea0-f1bfa4edfcc1
		- According to Bloom, theme is represented as *literally* a subject or topic. EG: Knowledge.
			- Theme is derived from the ancient Greek word for 'place,' *Topos*.
			- *topoi* is the plural of *topos.*
		- Topos is meant to be understood as a very wide reaching and broad concept.
			- Along with theme comes *arguments,* *assertions,* *issues,* *concerns,* *opinions,* and *experiences.*
			- There is no knowledge without *an interpretation of knowledge.*
	- The layman's interpretation of theme and Bloom's interpretation of theme present semantic redundancies which can make disseminating the information problematic, especially when teaching.
		- To fix this, I will refer to Bloom's interpretation of theme as *topos*.
		- All other interpretation, the commonplace and my own idea of what theme is will remain the name, *theme.*
	- ## Current relevant research vocabulary
	  id:: 63339c5c-eee2-45d4-9e15-e30599e5081d
		- ### *Topos* is knowledge and/or the subject matter of a myth.
			- Topos provides the easy answer to the common question of:
				- *What is the story about?*
					- The story is about *The American Dream*
		- ### *Theme* is the writer's subjective interpretation of *topos.*
			- Theme provides context and opinion regarding topos.
				- *The story is about The American Dream...*
				- How *The American Dream...is destructive*...
		- ### *Controlling Idea* is how theme applied to narrative design.
			- The Controlling Idea is the *story engine* or the purpose of the story.
				- *The story is about The American Dream...*
				- How *The American Dream...is destructive*...
				- How *you can fail your only shot at the dream, and will sacrifice everything for another chance.*
		- ### *Dramatic Question* is using the controlling idea to form a question which is answered by the narrative premise.

			- ### Is losing everything worth the dream even knowing in the end it isn't real?

			- Alice spent her childhood dreaming and training to become an elite Space Ranger. But she washed out her first day at Space Ranger Boot Camp (sprained ankle in the shower).  Back at home, with no direction, Alice spent days coping in virtual reality.  It got so bad that her family threatened to kick her out if she doesn't get her shit together. Desperate and without any real options, Alice decides to do the one thing she's been doing her whole life...becoming an elite Space Ranger *online.*
		- ### *Metaphor* is a figurative interpretation of something literal (theme).
			- Metaphor is achieved through the use of *literary devices*

	- **Literary Examples**
		- Hamlet
		- Brave New World
		- The Catcher in the Rye
		- Fahrenheit 451
	- ## Bloom's Interpretation of Alienation
		- Hamlet and Kafka are the two authors who primarily represent Alienation
			- Nietzsche is the link between Kafka and Hamlet.
			- *In Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche taught us a certain kind of contempt for the very act of speaking, since that for which we can find words is something already dead in our hearts.*
				- *Contempt* - Self-hatred or loathing for oneself.
				- *for the very act of speaking* - vocalizing outwards, or communicating with another.
					- IE: Hatred for communication
				- *for which we can find words is something already dead in our hearts* - the concept of communicating outwardly to another is akin to meaninglessness.
				- My interpretation:
					- When someone asks you, 'what is wrong?' and are unable to really vocalize 'what is wrong' is a phenomenon of alienation.
					- The tragedy, is that an individual may be still in a battle or fighting with an issue that he/she is struggling with.
					- The concept that they are unable to vocalize their troubles does not signal 'weirdness' or 'strangeness,' but that the person may still be at battle with their issue.
					- One cannot simply talk casually when they are at war with themselves.
					- After the battle is complete, and one can actually talk about the issue, why? Why would there be a need to talk to you about what I went through when you have no idea?
					- The deed is done. The battle is over. The beast is dead.
			- ## The tragic duality of Alienation: self-hatred, self-sufficiency, and self-strength vs selfish, self-centered, and egocentric.
				- The Hero or The Self - is at constant battle with themselves. They are unable to see the effects of their behavior in the outer world.
				- The World - is at constant battle with the unknown. They are threatened by what they do not understand. The unknown is therefore seen as an untrustworthy wielding of immeasurable power.
			- ## Powerband
				- The Self *does not understand itself.* The Self is *weak*
					- The Self *fears itself as well as the world*
					- The Self believes she is *powerless and must hide*
					- The Self believes The World's interpretation of The Self.
						- *For the sake of the world, she hides to the extent that she can protect it.*
				- The World *does not understand the self.* The World is *fearful.*
					- The World *fears the Self as if the Self is hiding unmeasurable power.*
					- The World believes the self *is powerful and is not hiding, but simply formulating to attack the world.*
					- The World believes *its own interpretation of The Self, and does not consider other possibilites.*
						- *For the sake of the world, the world must destroy the self so that they may live in peace.*
				- ## Tragic Powershift
					- The Self *understands itself* and becomes *strong.*
						- The world *understands the self as the self understands herself.*
						- Tragic Conflict as the self becomes her own, and the world remains fearful.
					- The Self *destroys herself* and *dies.*
						- The world *understands the self as the self fails to do so.*
						- Tragic Conflict as the world blames itself and promises to be less fearful of the unknown.
					- The Self *understands herself* and the World *accepts her power.*
						- The word *understands the self as the self understands herself.*
						- Tragic Conflict as the self becomes her own, and the world attempts to control her.
	- ## Alienation in Literature
		- ### Bartleby, the Scrivener by Herman Melville - *Reading the Original: Alienation, Writing, and Labor in Bartleby, the Scrivener by Robert T. Tally, Jr.*
			- Lay Definition - *A condition of being estranged from someone or something.*
			- Law Definition - *Something is alienable if it can be sold.*
				- *"Inalienable rights"* are rights that cannon be sold.
			- Social Psychology - *A person's psychological withdrawal from society.*
			- Critical Social Theory - *A worker is alienated from the products of their labor.*
				- See Marx.
			- Literature - *The psychological isolation of an individual from community or society*
		- ### The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath by Sylvia Plath - *Alienation and Renewal in Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar by Steven Gould Axelrod*
			- Being alienated by society may beget active alienation by the character.
			- The Bell Jar is in written in the first person, which wholly *alienates* the reader themselves.
			- The reader may not like Esther (main character) and may subsequently actively alienate the character.
			- Important to note is the *Cause of alienation.*
				- Often *society* is that cause, if not society, the *character's tragic interpretation of being alienated.*
		- ### Black Boy by Richard Wright - *Richard Wright's Blues by Ralph Ellison*
			- Alienation of blackness is prevalent in the American lexicon.
				- Wright explores how *art* is a method of *expressing*, *understanding*, *processing*, and *witnessing* unjust human suffering.
				- *"both the agony of life and the possibility of conquering it through sheer toughness of spirit."*
			- Ellison states that 'self-annihilation and fearfulness can be converted into willingness to confront the world, evaluate his/her experience honestly, and to throw their findings unashamedly into the guilty conscience of America.'
		- ### Brave New World by Aldous Huxley - *Alienation in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World by Josephine A. McQuail*
			- Only the individual that alienated as well as self-aware of their alienation can achieve true human consciousness, if not happiness.
				- Theme of Alienation expressed through several concepts
					- psychological
					- sociological
					- sexual
					- biological
					- aesthetic
			- "Alienation is the driveshaft of revolution." - Horowitz
			- Huxley argues that society without art is not worth living in recognizing that to have art, one must sacrifice happiness for pain, suffering, and alienation.
			- One could say that Huxley alienates humanity from itself through the use of technology. In a quest for happiness and equality, we have alienated ourselves from our humanity.
		- ### The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger - *Alienation, Materialism, and Religion in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye by Robert C. Evans*
			- Alienation from the view of the American Teenager.
			- The teenager, in search of truth, does not find it within the means of his immediate environment.
			- Thus, the teenager rebels and alienates himself through his tragic realization that the world is 'phony.'
		- ### The Chosen by Chaim Potok - *The Head, the Heart and the Conflict of Generations in Chaim Potok's The Chosen by Sam Bluefarb*
			- *The Alienation of the Impulsiveness of the Heart vs The Alienation of the Obsessions of the Head.*
			- Two characters that embody alienation in two different forms but of the same world.
				- Generational conflict
					- One can feel alienated when parents/older or children/younger individuals see the world radically different from the other.
				- The temperamental conflict (heart vs head)
					- The heart wants to fall in love but the head does not want to feel hurt.
						- The heart can alienate itself by not using their head.
						- The head can alienate itself by not feeling emotions.
				- petrified fanaticism vs human tolerance
					- petrified fanaticism - alienation of those who do not abide by the rigid rules and sacrifice of fanaticism.
					- human tolerance - alienation of those who do not 'have a heart.'
				- two visions of God and man's relationship to Him.
					- God is forgiving.
					- God is vengeful.
		- ### Dubliners by James Joyce - *Alienation in James Joyce's Dubliners by Blake Hobby*
			- *Alienation as isolation and paralysis.*
			- *'Dubliners is an expressionist artwork.'*
			- *'Such works use the most penetrating means imaginable, no matter how unusual, to communicate inner thoughts and emotions-a goal that echoes Joyce's desire to describe the Dubliners 'for the most part in a style of scrupulous meanness.'*
			- *'As they depict angst-ridden lives, Joyce's stories convey a powerful sense of alienation. By quickly shifting characters and perspectives and moving through the stages of human life-childhood, adolescence, and maturity--Joyce provides a panoramic view of turn-of-the-century Dublin as a paralyzed world.'*
			- *'One of the three italicized words introduced to readers on the first page of the text, paralysis conveys the alienation of Joyce's characters.'*
			- *'Dubliners contains many frenetic spectacles that depict commerce, social mechanisms, and the pace of modernity as a meaningless, cacophonous game that engulfs all and leaves individuals alone and isolated.'*
		- ### Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury - *Burning Bright: Fahrenheit 451 as Symbolic Dystopia*
			- *Alienation as rejection of dystopian futurism.*
			- *'In his essay on fire symbolism in Fahrenheit 451, Donald Watt emphasizes the real possibility that modern culture may eradicate itself in nuclear war, an ironic notion when one considers that the technological tools developed to create a greater sense of freedom ushered in an alienated age of disillusionment and paranoia.'*
			- *'As Watt says, Montag, the book's protagonist, desires 'something enduring in man's existence-history, heritage, culture. Montag seeks, in essence, a definition and preservation of the identity of human kind.'*
			- *'To live in a world of destruction that is quickly erasing its past is to become an exile, one who seeks to keep 'the flame of man's wisdom and creativity' alive.'*
			- *'Montag and the other exiles try to preserve humanity's accumulated wisdom by memorizing books: our tools of self-understanding and self-preservation in an alienating age.'*
			- *'Bradbury's tale suggests we have lost our humanity in the search for knowledge and technological advancement.'*
			- *'Thus, his dystopian world both represents and decries modern alienation, itself a symptom of unbridled 'progress' in which, by following blind ideals, 'we can hardly escape from ourselves.'*
		- ### Hamlet by Youknowwho - *Book IV, Chapter XIII by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe*
			- *Alienation as inner-conflict.*
			- *'This excerpt from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Travels includes an influential interpretation of Hamlet in which the young Goethe hero identifies with Hamlet's alienation and inability to avenge his father's murder.'*
			- *'Goethe raises a key question: Why is Hamlet unable to act? Wilhelm Meister, often considered Goethe's mouthpiece, concentrates on Hamlet's psychological stress and the many causes of his alienation and inertia.'*
			- *'According to Wilhelm, Hamlet alienates himself by retreating into a conflicted interior world. His self-imposed isolation is the result of overactive, ever-reaching mind that circles upon itself, removing the prince of Denmark from the field of human interaction: 'He winds, and turns, and torments himself; he advances and recoils; is ever put in mind; ever puts himself in mind; at last does all but lose his purpose from his thoughts; yet still without recovering his peace of mind.'*
		- ### The Iliad by Homer - *The Solidary Amphora: Alienation and Tradition in Homer's Iliad by Scott F. Crider*
			- *Alienation as God-King.*
			- *Alienation through death of a friend.*
			- *'In Politics, Aristotle recognizes that human beings are essentially social: The life of a person is lived in common with other people, and the institution of that common life is the city or polis.'*
			- *'A person who is unable to share in common life or is so self-sufficient that he or she chooses not to is either an animal or a god. Unlike the animal and the divine, however, the human life is by nature political.'*
			- *'This association is guided toward some end or good that contributes to the flourishing life. Consequently the defining characteristic of human association is an agreement upon the end or good to be sought together, an agreement achieved through language.'*
			- *'Even though we are political beings, we can choose not to be: A person may be apolitical, 'alienated' from human association and its shared goods. For Aristotle, this is not a good thing, and his simile for the apolitical person is 'an isolated piece at draughts', a piece whose purpose is defined by the game and the other pieces from which he or she is isolated.'*
		- ### Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison - *Alienation as Narrative Strategy in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man by Aimable Twagilimama*
			- *Alienation through blind allegiance to authority.*
				- Isolation via invisibility via not being recognized for anything of particular importance.
				- Alienated for being non-impactful yet have done *everything right.*
			- *'In this fictional autobiography, he attempts to make sense of his alienation from America's historical, cultural, economic, ideological, and literary landscape. To a degree, his alienation is self-imposed due to his repeated blind allegiance to authority.'*
			- *'Though it would appear these authorities eventually force the alienation upon him, the Invisible Man's movement underground is a demonstration of his freedom. He consciously acknowledges his invisibility and proclaims, 'I am nobody but myself,' telling us his 'hibernation' - his alienation from society-'is over.'*
			- *'Du Bois describes the African American as covered with a veil, a metaphor that suggests invisibility to American society, the viewer. From this threshold, he would like 'to merge his double self into a better and truer self.'*
			- *'Like Martin Luther King Jr. after him, Ellison engages both white and black America by exposing the country's broken promises. Significant individuals, periods, and ideologies directly and indirectly invoked by Invisible Man include Thomas Jefferson...'*
		- ### Mrs. Dolloway by Virginia Woolf - *Divided Selves by Jeremy Hawthorn*
			- *Alienation through isolation leads to madness.*
			- *'In his study of alienation in Mrs. Dalloway, Jeremy Hawthorn argues that madness in Virginia Woolf's novel 'is seen both as a symbol and a result of alienation.'*
			- *'Such alienation, according to Hawthorn, cuts the individual off from society, denies the individual 'full human contact,' and exacerbates 'any predisposition towards mental disorder in an individual who had difficult in making contact with other people.'*
			- *'Focusing primarily on Septimius Smith's mental instability, Hawthorn concludes that the alienation of the individual at odds with society animates the work, ultimately making 'Septimius a sort of hero manqué,' who willingly accepts death 'in order to preserve his own existential unity.'*
		- ### Notes from Underground by Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky - *The Journal Epoch , Notes from the Underground by Konstantin Mochulsky*
			- *Alienation through cognitive paralysis*
				- An over-analytical mind and awareness of inability to affect the world. 'Consciousness is sickness, leading to inertia.'
			- *'Knostantin Mochulsky's essay on Notes from Underground focuses on the underground man's alienation, which Mochulsky attributes to the underground man's over analytical mind and awareness of his inability to affect the world--the way that his 'Consciousness is a sickness, leading to inertia.'*
			- *'As with Hamlet, 'Consciousness kills feeling, corrupts the will, paralyzes action.' For Mochulsky, the  underground man is a 'human tragedy.'
			- *'Quoting Dostoevsky's Diary of a Writer, Mochulsky finds what might be called the alienated condition of modernity, in which we know we cannot end suffering: 'The consciousness of our own utter inability to help or to bring, if only some, benefit or relief to suffering mankind,...can even transform the love of mankind in your heart into hatred for it.'*
		- ### One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey - *The Grail Knight Arrives by Raymond M. Olderman*
			- *Alienation through institutionalized isolation.*
			- *'In his study of One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, Raymond M. Olderman compares the book's asylum with the world described in T.S. Eliot's poem, The Waste Land, often interjecting lines from the Eliot poem to describe the site of imprisonment in Kesey's novel: "The waste land of the asylum is characterized not only by mechanization and efficiency but sterility, hopelessness, fear, and guilt. The inmates are aimless, alienated and bored; they long for escape; they 'can connect/ Nothing with Nothing,' not even picture puzzles; they are enervated and emasculated; their dignity is reduced to something less than human.'*
			- *'Nothing the alienating effects of the institution and the way such institutions 'symbolize the immense power that reduces us,' Olderman comments on the way we internalize systems of power with all their dictates while failing to make sense of an irrational world, 'a world gone mad.' Thus, for Olderman, to live in modern society means being caught in an alienated space which stems from both the institutions that overshadow us and the irrational drives that make us believe the waking world is a fantasy that excludes us.'*

	- Bloom suggests that Civil Disobedience is limited by defining it.
		- *rhetoric and dramatic representation replace civic action and suffering, civil disobedience can begin to mean everything and nothing.*
	- ### *"...civil disobedience [is] a public, nonviolent, conscientious, yet political act contrary to law usually done with the aim of bringing about a change in law or policies of the government."* - John Rawls, A Theory of Justice.
	-
	- ## Civil Disobedience in Literature
		- ## *Of Man's Last Disobedience: Zamiatin's We and Orwell's 1984*
			- *Rebellion mirrors an ideal world where modern human beings are constricted and suppressed by the social order, find their source of discontent in civilization's utopian dreams.*
				- Disobedience in dystopia mirror that of Adam in the Garden of Eden. Rebellion against a God-like state. In doing so, they fall from grace, punished by God for disobedience.
		- ## *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain*
			- *Any act of civil disobedience is rooted in a prior act of obedience to individual conscience. The person who practices civil disobedience obeys his own conscience, instead of society's conscience.*
		- ## *Antigone by Sophocles*
			- *At the heart of any act of civil disobedience is conscience. There is conflict between rational human law and the divinely given 'unwritten' law. EG - Morality.*
		- ## *The Plays of Aristophanes*
			- *The purpose of civil disobedience may not always be central to the individual. Civil disobedience may be performed by those who believe others do not posses the knowledge to understand the injustice plagued against them. Rebellion against power wielded behind a veil of secrecy and a call to arms to those who are unjustly persecuted.*
		- ## *Bartleby, The Scrivener by Herman Melville*
			- *To have a conscience in an unjust world and to choose a path of conformity is an absurd and untenable tragic existence.*
		- ## *Billy Budd by Herman Melville*
			- *The conflict between conscience and the laws of man are central to civil disobedience.*

		- ## *Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau*

		- ## *Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky*
			- *Residence of the modern age have not only the right, but also the responsibility to rebel against injustice. Despite how grotesque, logical, honest, and brutal a truth might be, injustice must still fought against.*
		- ## *The Crucible by Arthur Miller*
			- *Civil Disobedience in modern times pushes residents to the limits of their conscience. When forced between two choices of national security and civil liberties, each have their own dogmatic methods of civil disobedience to compete with one another. While both disdain each other for a lack of moral conscience, both clearly share the same purpose of creating a society in which humanity can flourish. While both sides fight in a battle of rhetorical and semantic, the world crumbles and morphs into an existence which makes their moral infighting irrelevant to society.*
		- ## *Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury*
			- *Civil Disobedience as an act of reading, gathering knowledge, or building intelligence, and thus creating a robust and nuanced conscience.*
		- ## *The Poetry of Langston Hughes*
			- *Civil Disobedience as an act of poetry and speech. Using literal devices, one can create a visceral and honest depiction of injustice that pierces through social construct and calls upon individual's conscience of morality and justice.*
		- ## *Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison*
			- *To exercise civil disobedience, one must first be a member of said civil society. To rebel against injustice, the black man must be 'smuggled into society's machinery in some form.'* - Brian E. Butler, University of North Carolina at Asheville.
		- ## *Julius Caesar by Youknowwho*
			- *The tragic nature of revolution and civil disobedience dies for two reasons: freedom fails at the flashpoint of revolution or fails over time under the weight and power of a despotism.*
				- ### *You either die the hero, or live long enough to become the villian.* - The Dark Knight
		- ## *Letter from Birmingham Jail by Martin Luther King, Jr.*
			- *A citizen owes obedience to the state despite the existence of laws they believe to be unjust.*
		- ## *The Speeches of Malcom X*
			- *When you appeal the conscience of your nation, its inner sense of justice,  its consistency of law and order  through the tolerated form of civil disobedience and it consistently refuses to change, the only path left is violent revolution.*
		- ## *Native Son by Richard Wright*
			- *Persons who engage in self-destructive violent actions that go against an individuals conscience can find peace in victimhood.*
		- ## *The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli*
			- *Civil Disobedience can only occur in a society that tolerates the act. Crime can only occur in a society that punishes deeds that violate conscious morality. In a society that does not tolerate civil disobedience and does not persecute crime, there is no conscious morality. Those that thrive are one's who prioritize glory and power over peace.*
		- ## *The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne*
			- *Individuals must obey laws regulating private behavior, laws that directly conflict with individuals' deeply held principles. Submission to law is viewed as integrity-destroying cowardice and cannot be understood as courageous or beneficial to the individual.*
		- ## *The Trial by Franz Kafka*
			- *A state's exercise in justice can be morphed into an armature of control designed to persecute individuals regardless of moral conscious. A state which creates, interprets, and translates its own laws can only empower the persecuted to appeal to the humanity left within the apparatus and society through civil disobedience.*

- # DARK HUMOR
  collapsed:: true
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663389373739_0.png)
	- According to Bloom - *defining dark humor is virtually impossible...saying one thing while meaning another...often the opposite of what is said*
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663291739367_0.png)
		- Motherfucker. I feel like Bloom loves to confront his own intellectual impotence  in the voyeuristic method of academic journalism. Its like he soaks  in his own tub of masochistic self-righteous god-king-philosophesque superiority....where the tub has runneth over-full of his own shit. The stench overwhelming, putrid yet somewhat sweeet. The lay person recoils in abject disgust, while the more perverse practitioners of narrative criticism simply cannot look away at his audacity and sheer brilliance.
		- How else can one write a book series based on species defining narrative devices--then have the fucking audacity to start each fucking volume with *defining xxx is virtually impossible?*
		- No shit, you fuck face. I cannot argue with that fact. While you, are, indeed, yes, the master of the auto-spetic self-therapy(coping), I am not here to gawk at your undeniably freakish genius level of geriatric digestive mastery.
		- The man is senile. Or has gone beyond the edge into cyber psychosis. A master of *coitus reservatus* he has surpassed the mere mortal carnic desire to c00m. To even attempt to explain what the meaning of every-story-ever-told-and-ever-will-be  is an exercise in futility. Yet, he still attempts the impossible. Tragic. Heroic even.
		- ***Let me in the tub, master. Let me prove I am worthy. Fuckface.***
	- ## Dark Humor in Literature
		- ### ***The Plays of Aristophanes*** - *Aristophanes' Comic Apocalypse by Louise Cowan*
			- *The question of how one is blessed amidst war, avarice, contention, and falsehood* is the essence of Dark Humor
			- Aristophanes, an apocalyptic writer, creates using *double vision.*
			- *"This duality...allows the writer to be possessed by a spirit of nonsense, absurdity, and contradiction, so that he may undertake his supremely difficult task of raising earthly existence to a new plane of being."*
		- ### ***The Plays of Samuel Beckett and the Theatre of the Absurd*** - *The Theatre of the Absurd by Martin Esslin*
			- *"The Theatre of the Absurd is a darkly comic form that places great demands upon audiences, asking them to juxtapose incongruencies and to make sense out of often horrific laughter...it 'may be riotously funny, wildly exaggerated and oversimplified, vulgar and garish, but will always confront the spectator with a genuine intellectual problem, a philosophical paradox, which they will have to solve even if they know its probably insoluble.'"*
			- In other words...dark comedy is a recipe for a depth of flavor that may only be truly understood by specific members of the audience. Others may be repulsed while the rest may be clueless.
		- ### ***Catch-22 by Joseph Heller*** - *Catch-22 and Angry Humor: A study of the Normative Values of Satire*
			- *"rather than affirming conservative norms that its audience can agree on, [Catch-22] questions and undermines many values at the heart of American Life."*
				- Aggressive Capitalism
				- Bureaucracy
				- *"certain 'insane' and destructive elements of modern civilization which ender at the expense of humanity and compassion"*
		- ### ***Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut*** - *Dark Humor in Cats Cradle by Blake Hobby, University of North Carolina at Asheville*
			- *"All humor involves, negotiations, absurdities, and dark truths about our lives, including our inability to defeat death and the conflicted way we cope with the darkest of all dark realities."*
			- *"The darkness of comedy commingles with its lightness"*
		- ### ***A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess*** - *A Clockwork Orange and the Metaphysics of Slapstick.*
			- *Slapstick* - the mode of comedy which converts visceral 'violence into something funny on the most primal of levels.'
			- *Both the Writer and the Main Character are* **appalling and appealing**
			- *Slapstick takes a complex and elevated opinion and reduces it to primal diction.*
				- It appeals to the, lets say, reptillian brain as opposed to the woke-societal conscience.
			- #### *"The old veck began to make sort of chumbling shooms---'wuf waf wof.'"*
				- as opposed to
			- #### *"The old man began to make indecipherable noises."*
		- ### ***On Dark Humor in Literature*** - *The Comedy of Entropy: The Contexts of Black Humor by Patrick O'Neill*
			- O'Neill defines the genre as *entropic humor* or *black humor* or *negro chuckles* (wtf?)
				- (in O'Neill's defense he recognizes the pejorative nature of *black* humor. Negro chuckles was my ~~retarded~~ shit-brained dark humor attempt to question the pejorative nature of...fuck if you don't get it then ~~fuck you~~ familiarize yourself with the literature)
			- *[entropic humor] allows us to envisage the facelessness of the void and yet be able to laugh rather than despair.*
		- ### ***Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri*** - *Elements of Dark Humor in Dante's Divine Comedy*
			- **"The Divine Comedy"** *is a three-part work that recounts the poet's journey through Hell and Purgatory and his eventual arrival in Heaven.*
				- *Dante did not apply the term 'divine' to his own work, it was first applied by some guy name Boccaccio. (pasta?) but no one really knows for sure.*
			- "*The comedy is comedic because its plot trajectory. From misery, hatred, and discord, to joy, love, and peace.* The journey is cosmic comedy.
			- In a sense, the story is divine comedy because to achieve true happiness, man must journey through the exact opposite...unlubricated and unexpected anal penetration.
			- I also believe its due to the absurdity of the notion. Is divine eternal happiness worth unyielding and unending suffering? The promise of a notion you can't even comprehend?
		- ### ***The Dumbwaiter by Harold Pinter*** - *When Farce Turns into Something Else: Harold Pinter's the Dumb Waiter*
			- **"The Comedy of Menace"** *is an image made up of equal parts danger, ridiculousness, and middle-class domesticity*
			- Pinter, an actor himself, applies silence to the comedic principle of *the rule of three.*
				- **"The Rule of Three"** is the notion that something funny should be repeated twice, then the third a resolute variation of the third.
			- *Tongue and cheekish, the comedy of menace is ironically British.*
		- ### **The Stories of Nikolai Gogol and Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov** - *Observations on Black Humor in Gogol and Nabokov by W. Woodin Rowe*
			- *Such humor, by twisting or reversing generally accepted attitudes and values, tends to undermine the reader's world.*
			- Writer's use dark humor to disarm readers of their prejudice, preconceived notions, and assumptions on subjects seen as taboo, improper, and indelicate.
			- *Dark humor enables both to comment upon the reality of the social world and the reality of the human condition.*
		- ### A Good Man is Hard to Find by Flannery O'Connor - *Cliches, Superficial Story-Telling, and the Dark Humor of Flannery O'Connor's A Good Man is Hard to Find by Robert C Evans*
			- *"When you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs you do, you can relax a little and use more normal means of talking to it; when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock"*
				- *Ain't she cute?*
					- **AWW RITE MATE I'D GIV YA GRANNY ASS A RIPE OLD WYPE AIN'T YA GOV?**
				- ...*Ain't she cute...*
			- *O'Connor's story begins with worldly humor but ends with otherworldly transcendence.*
		- ### Henry IV, Parts One and Two by youknowwho - *The Rejection of Falstaff by AC Bradley*
			- *Instead of being comic to the reader and serious to himself, he is more ludicrous to himself than to you, and he makes himself out more ludicrous than he is, in order that he and others may laugh*
		- ### The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by Thomas Stearns Elliot - *Almost Ridiculous: Dark Humor in Eliot's The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by Robert C. Evans*
			- *Prufrock is painfully self-aware of his weaknesses, his flaws, and his shortcomings, and honest readers will have to confess that Prufrock's flaws are not his alone. We cannot help but laugh sometimes at Prufrock, just as he insistently laughs at himself. The joke is not entirely on Profrock. He in many was is the archetype of man, and conscientious readers will have to confess that in laughing at him, they laugh partly at themselves.*
		- ### The Mysterious Stranger by Mark Twain - *The Mysterious Stranger and '3,000 Years Among the Microbes': Chimerical Realities and Nightmarish Transformations by Patricia M. Mandia*
			- *"Twain fuses horror with humor, indicates that man has no free will, and ridicules man's follies without offering answers or standards because, since man does not possess the power to change, this would be futile."*
		- ### Reservation Blues by Sherman Alexie - *The Saddest Joke: Sherman Alexie's Blues by James A. Crank*
			- *"Alexie uses humor to articulate the possibility for beauty and joy even in the heartbreaking surroundings of the Native American reservation."*
			- *"Humor allows the opportunity for Alexie to dialogue with stereotypes and reservation idiosyncrasies."*
		- ### White Noise by Don DeLillo - *The Dark Humor of White Noise by Joseph Dewey*
			- *"Knowledge of death inevitably reduces life to quivering anxiety. We must therefore repress our fear of death and, in the process, indulge the fabulous escapism of constructing extravagant afterlife alternatives"*
				- Imagination and creativity are often the root of humor and escapism. Both are ways to combat the logical and inevitable fear of inescapable death.
		- ### Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward Albee - *Dark Humor in Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*
			- *Edward Albee uses dark humor to create a discomforting, audience-implicating social satire, an evisceration of our own most basic and sacred tenets. His intention is to hold a mirror to the complex daily hypocrisies we all perpetuate and contend with.*
		- ### The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman - *Too Terribly Good to Be Printed: Charlotte Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper*
			- *'Common Sense' can be an irrational and dogmatic view of the world that decries both irrationality and dogmatism. The end of Gilman's story exposes such ironies in such a way that is both comic and terrifying.*
- # DEATH AND DYING

	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663653515487_0.png)
	- ## According to Bloom...
		- All fiction turns towards the inevitability of death, the ultimate and natural limit, and frame it rather as a celebration....a will and celebration to live in spite of doom.
		- *Learning to live with one's own immortality is the most universal educations in reality.
	- ## Death and Dying in Literature
		- ### All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque - *Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front by Merrit Moseley*
			- *All Quiet on the Western Front tackles how War, in other words death on a massive scale is perceived before and after war.*

			- *Some men felt most alive and at their prime in the midst of war.*

			- *Most animals are aware of death, but perhaps only humans are aware of its personal inevitability.*
			- *Death may arrive abruptly or gradually, but its coming is certain and inescapable.*
			- *Death remains the most mysterious of all aspects of existence.*
			- *Dickinson explores death to depths that each of us as humans do, but like all of us, she does not know a definitive answer but allows us to freely examine it for ourselves without fear or judgment.*
		- ### Beloved by Toni Morrison - *Death and Dying in Beloved by Deborah James*
			- *Toni Morrison uses the paranormal as a method to examine the nature of dying in regards to blackness in America.*
			- *"Anything dead coming back to life hurts."*
			- Death is framed as *closure* or *true death* for Morrison. Those that succumb to death with a lifetime of anguish, persecution, and pain are not able to experience *true death.*
			- Those who have not died must reckon with the dead who have died a *true death* especially those in which they are personally responsible for their pain.
			- The *paranormal* represents injustice and conscience that exists in the psyche of the living. How ghosts may haunt the living in the sense that unless the living can reconcile their guilt they too may die *untrue.*
		- ### Catch-22 by Joseph Heller - *Joseph Heller's Catch-22 by Merritt Moseley*
			- *Novels about war are about death and dying.*
			- *Crucial with respect to the vital themes of self and manhood are the encounter with fear and the question of conduct under fire.*
			- War is a continuous process of death and dying.
			- The tragedy is when one man, an individual, is a part of the process and must reckon with his own consciousness.
			- *Somebody has to do something, sometime* about this....
			- *"...his removal from the war zone, though it will do almost nothing to slow down the death and dying, will at least remove him as one link in the chain of killing and being killed, hurting and being hurt, being victimized and making victims of others."*
			- In the grand scheme of human existence, a man's actions may mean nothing. But for the miniscule moment of his existence, he did *what he could.*
		- ### Chronicle of a Death Foretold by Gabriel Garcia Marquez - *More Deaths Than One: Chronicle of a Death Foretold by William Gass*
			- *Dying is an inertia, a representation of a decaying society, where death is simply the final symptom of a chronic disease.*
			- *"...it is about the heart blowing to bits from the burden of its own beat."*
			- Death and dying can be applied to a society as a whole, and not only that of a single person.
		- ### The Dead by James Joyce - *The Dead by Bernard Benstock in James Joyce's Dubliners: Critical Essays*
			- *The Motif of Death*
			- There are three levels of dead: *the deceased, the moribund, and the living dead.*
			- *Mortality haunts us as a specter over each person's existence. Each of us 'has a potential to rise above the mortality that haunts us and to discover ourselves.'*
				- The deceased - dead
				- The moribund - the moment of death
				- The living dead - those who are temporally close to moribund.
		- ### Death Be Not Proud by John Gunther - *Death Be Not Proud: Children, Families, and Cancer in Postwar America by Gretchen Krueger*
			- *A slow and dying death from cancer, especially in that of a young person, resonates with society. In a way, a society has failed its most vulnerable, an inability to protect those who are sworn to a life.*
			- *Death Be Not Proud shows, in excruciating detail, how a young boy's final days are spent. One who has to reckon with death at an age so often remembered as one of great joy.*

		- ### In Cold Blood by Truman Capote - *Faith and Tragedy in In Cold Blood by John McClain*
			- *There are two types of death in In Cold Blood: Death by Murder and Death by Legal Execution.*
			- Capote sees murders as, "brothers in the breed of Cain."
				- Cain, first son of Adam and Eve, murdered his brother, Abel.
					-
				- God punishes Cain with *banishment* and not *death.*
			- Capote indicts capital punishment, in a way that does not defend the actions of murderers.
			- Using Cain as a backdrop for argument, one can frame the hypocrisy of 'In God We Trust' used by a country that chooses capital punishment in direct opposition to God's forgiveness in an identical situation.
		- ### In Memoriam by Alfred Lord Tennyson - *The Way of the Soul by A.C. Bradley*
			- *coming to terms with death and dying*

		- *Exodus* is the story of Moses, the reluctant prophet compelled by Yahweh to a great career of triumphant suffering, 'or should we call it triumph?'
		- *Exodus* is of the Old Testament which is the Christian revision of *Tanakh*
		- The heroes of *Tanakh* are outcasts that bear the *Blessing.*
		- The *Blessing* is a tragic destiny which each of these outcasts bear. Their *chosenness* is their destiny though at the expense of their 'greatest sorrow.'

	- ## Enslavement and Emancipation in Literature
	- ### The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain - *The Paradox of Liberation in Huckleberry Finn by Neil Schmitz*
		- *"Jim's situation at the end of Huckleberry Finn reflects that of the Negro in Reconstruction, free at last and thoroughly impotent, the object of devious schemes and a hapless victim  of constant brutality."*
		- "*The central question for Schmitz 'is not Jim's freedom per se, but whether he will seize it or be given it, and then, most horrifying of all--what is to be done with him in either case, this emancipated, alien black man?"*
	- ### Beloved by Toni Morrison - *Beloved and the Transforming Power of the World by Louise Cowan*
		- *The poet, when living through injustice, is responsible for translating the suffering of peoples to those who read in the future.*
		- *Beloved herself, 'is the whole body of unassimilated wrongs of a people, all their wounds and indignities, all their longing for love to heal injustices. She is a sense of injury so strong that she stands ready to intrude into people's lives and stop them from living in her incessant calling out for the love she was denied.'*
	- ### The Death of Ivan Ilych by Leo Tolstoy - *The Death and Emancipation of Ivan Ilych by Merritt Moseley*
		- *There are two sorts of enslavement dramatized in Tolstoy's story:*
			- *Imprisonment within the human body, an enslavement to the mortal condition of life*
			- *Imprisonment as a thoughtless bondage to a set of false values and ideals.*
		- *"Ilych's ignorantly blissful lifestyle and total denial of death imprison him within a delusion about his own morality."*
		- *"He enslaves himself to a set of skewed values and false ideals that hide from him the greatest most basic truth in life: inevitable death."*
	- ### The Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson - *Thomas Jefferson and the Great Declaration by Moses Coit Tyler*
		- *The Declaration of Independence declared emancipation from tyranny of the British monarchy.*
		- *"...[it] is a kind of war-song; a stately and passionate chant of human  freedom; it is a prose lyric of civil and military heroism."*
		- ### The Book of Exodus - *Exodus by Allen Dwight Callahan*
			- *Exodus focuses on Israel's enslavement and subsequent emancipation from Egypt.*
			- *Callahan articulates how Exodus is important for African-Americans and how the book has shaped its culture and religion.*
			- *Moses in African-American culture is a complex character as he represents the story of bondage and deliverance.*
			- *"The laws of the land of their nativity-that is, the laws of the United States-enshrined the country's founding documents, developed out of a collective historical experience that was not only alien to the African-American aspirations to freedom what was hostile to them."*
			- > We poor creatures have need to believe in God, for if God Almighty will not be good to us some day, why were we born? When I heard of his delivering his people from bondage, I knew it means poor Africans. - Polly, a slave, to her mistress
	- ### The Poetry of Langston Hughes - *Racial Individuality': Enslavement and Emancipation in the Poetry of Langston Hughes by Robert C. Evans*
		- *Hughes could never forget that he was not simply an author but was a 'Negro' author.*
		- *'According to Jones, Hughes was often trapped between his identity as a black man and his desire to be a respectable man of letters.'*
		- *'Rather than seeing any conflict between the impulse to write as a black person and the impulse to write freely, Hughes sought to erase that distinction altogether.'*
		- *'[Hughes] writes unashamedly as a black man, but he refuses to write merely or simply as an African American, as if nothing else about him mattered.'*
	- ### Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Jacobs - *Moral Experience in Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Sarah Way Sherman*

		- *The stark contradiction between life as a slave and life as a free man.*
		- *The narrative and language used as reflections as a slave seem to be focused on retaining the memory of his people before bondage. Yet after, being free, the language seems to be tiresome, and preoccupied with the mundane day to day life.*
	- ### The Penal Colony by Franz Kafka - *Enslavement and Emancipation in Franz Kafka's 'In the Penal Colony' by Lorena Russel*
		- *'The Penal Colony engages the theme of enslavement and emancipation in a remote penal colony marked by alienation, irrationality, and injustice.'*
		- *'The sense of injustice and irrationality in the story is heightened by the multiple absurdities of the story itself.'*
		- *'The lack of context and history also means that the relationships that develop between the characters provide the reader with much of the basis of understanding.'*
		- *'A lack of meaningful communication pervades the story, and further contributes to the mechanisms of enslavement, injustice, and oppression.'*
		- *'Lack of meaningful communication is also part of what alienates the prisoner from understanding the full implications of his predicament.'*
		- *'What sets imprisonment apart from slavery is that the former is presumably enacted under a system of justice.'*
	- ### The Speeches of Abraham Lincoln - *Lincoln the Literary Genius by Jacques Barzun*
		- *'four main qualities of Lincoln's literary art-precision, vernacular ease, rhythmical virtuosity and elegance'*
		- *'Lincoln's style is clear, forcible, individual, and distinguished.'*
		- *'Lincoln acquired his power over words in the only two ways known to man-by reading and writing.'*
		- > *'Again, you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was. We deny it. We admit that it is more prominent, but we deny that we made it so. It was not we, but you, who discard the old policy of the fathers. We resisted, and still resist, your innovation; and thence comes the greater prominence of the question. Would you have that question reduce to its former proportions? Go back to that old policy. What has been, will be again, under the same conditions. If you would have the peace of the old times, readopt the precepts and policy of the old times.'* - Abraham Lincoln addressing the South at Cooper Union, 1860.

		- *'Douglas gains his emancipation through literacy.'*

		- *'One Day marked a radical change in Society literary culture with its departure from the state-enforced doctrines of socialist realism--a set of guidelines codified by Stalin's cultural advisor Andrei Zhdanov to discourage artists from experimentation that either deviated from honest and realistic portrayals of life or lacked the proper revolutionary fervor.'*
		- *'By recounting a 'good day' of Shukov's imprisonment, Solzhenitsyn reveals the mechanisms of institutionalized servitude and its inability to control the oppressed.'*
	- ### Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe - *Enslavement and Emancipation in Robinson Crusoe by Luca Prono, Independent Scholar*
		- *'Robinson Crusoe focuses on the hazardous life of its title hero, whose impulse to travel makes him reject a reliable career as a merchant to seek adventure.'*
		- *'Crusoe himself is enslaved when, during his second voyage, his ship is captured by Turkish pirates and Crusoe becomes the captain's slave.'*
		- *'With its intertwined themes of enslavement and emancipation, Robinson Crusoe is a key text for understanding imperialism and the experience of the colonized.'*
		- *'The novel leaves readers to weigh the merits of Crusoe's emancipation and its ultimate cost: the creation of imperialist culture and the enslavement of the colonized.'*
	- ### A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf - *Images of Enslavement and Emancipation in Virginia Woolf's A room of One's Own by Deborah C. Solomon*
		- *The very title is one of the most recognized symbols of feminist emancipation.*
		- *'Many of the images she uses to explore enslavement and emancipation--arguably the two most important themes of her essay--easily evoke double readings.'*
		- *'Windows, frequently seen as symbols of visionary freedom, can be interpreted as both liberating and limiting; they expand a room's boundaries and offer an outlook on the world by the outlook that is often narrow, fragmentary, or troubling.'*
		- *'Woolf uses running water as a powerfully suggestive image throughout her essay. Fluid and unpredictable, rovers have long been associated with the emancipation of the mind and the expression of genius.'*
		- *'Woolf's repeated references to locks, keys, and gates, for instance, vividly illustrate the various intellectual privations woman have faced not just from being locked up or locked in, but from being locked out as well.'*
		- *'Woolf's choice of imagery lends an unforgettable charm and power to her claim that 'intellectual freedom depends upon material things.'*
	- ### Siddartha by Herman Hesse - *The Search for Emancipation in Herman Hesse's Siddhartha by H. Elizabeth Smith
		- *'Hesse's sweeping narrative moves from Siddhartha's enslavement to religious dogma to his ultimate emancipation from earthly desires.'*
		- *'The fundamental difference between the historical Buddha and Hesse's literary Siddhartha lies in the manner in which each man chooses to spend his time after enlightenment.'*
		- *'Siddhartha's perpetual sense of wanderlust and dissatisfaction help him to rail against the shackles of his 'enslavement,' whether it is his father's comfortable home, the ascetic sect, his beautiful courtesan, the power and wealth he gains, or his reckless gambling.'*
		- *'The river is the seminal source of emancipation in Siddhartha.'*
	- ### The Tempest by Youknowwho - *...with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury/Do I take part: Enslavement and Emancipation in Shakespeare's The Tempest by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'While Caliban is the character who is most obviously enslaved to Prospero, Ariel also exists in a kind of indentured servitude, and both characters eagerly desire their freedom.'*
		- *'It was Caliban who chose to enslave himself, both figuratively and literally, by yielding to his own 'fury', just as it is Caliban who chooses to remain and even further entrench himself within that kind of enslavement.'*
	- ### A Vindication of the Rights of Women and Woman in the Nineteenth Century by Mary Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller - *Margaret Fuller and Mary Wollstonecraft by George Elliot*
		- *'For Eliot, both women describe the enslaved position women occupy in the modern world and call out for emancipation, leaving the reader with 'ardent hopes of what women may become' and a vision of 'women as they are.'*
	- ### Visions of the Daughters of Albion by William Blake - *Blake's Vision of Slavery by David Erdman*
		- *'Erdman outlines the ways Blake engaged 'concrete historical situations' most notably the institution of slavery.'*
		- *'Blake's illuminated manuscripts become 'decreasingly inexplicable as we approach them with some knowledge of the facts...the modes of cruelty and prejudice which he wished to make known to the hearts of his contemporaries.'*
		- *'Erdman demonstrates how Blake decries enslavement and calls for emancipation.'*
	- ### The Poetry of Phillis Wheatley - *Emancipating Phillis Wheatley by Deborah James*
		- *'Wheatley came to American as a slave and became the first published African-American poet.'*
		- *'Her face is based on the specifics of her identity.'*
		- *'Wheatley's life has always been used to illustrate opposing views of blacks.'*
		- *'Who was Phillis Wheatley and what will her real gifts be to future generations? To ask such questions is to begin to emancipate Wheatley's texts from racist assumptions underlying the critical heritage and our very culture.'*
	- ### The Novels of Elie Wiesel - *Witness to the Absurd: Elie Wiesel and the French Existentialists by Mary Jean Green*
		- *'Wiesel's Night has introduced generations of readers to his own dramatic story of enslavement in the emancipation from Auschwitz and Buchenwald.'*
		- *'Wiesel's novels confronts the same contemporary problems of human action in the face of the absurd that dominate the works of Camus and Sartre.'*
		- *'Weisel's novels provide a forceful theistic alternative to the atheistic philosophies developed by Camus and Sartre, a theism which, hover, approaches similar problems in similar terms.'*
		- > *I rebel, --therefore we exist.* - Camus
		- *'It is this feeling of responsibility for others which provides a reason for Wiesel's characters to go on living and which gives meaning and direction to their lives.'*
		- > *Man may not have the last word, but he has the last cry. That moment marks the birth of art.* - Elie Wiesel

- # THE GROTESQUE
  collapsed:: true
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664421033363_0.png)
	- ## According to Bloom...
		- *'Astonishment is the mode of the Grotesque, though this is tinged with distaste, unlike the transcendent astonishment induced by the Sublime'*
		- *'Grotesque as a word is based upon grotto, a cave, underground and phantom-infested.'*
		- *'The master of the Grotesque was the now rather neglected Victorian poet Robert Browning.'*
	- ## The Grotesque in Literature
	- ### The American and European Grotesque - *Notes on the Grotesque: Anderson, Brecht, and Williams by James Schevill*
		- *'For James Schevill, the American Grotesque stems from both the American evangelical tradition, which he refers to as a 'grotesque version of Christianity,' and from the goal of 'individual, materialistic success.'*
		- *'Schevill first defines the characteristics of the grotesque and then observes the ways it has appeared as a trans-continental art form.'*
		- *'Popular concepts of grotesque still prevent our understanding the importance of this idea in American society.'*
		- I asked many people...their immediate reactions to grotesque. The great majority of answers emphasized three elements--*distorted, fantastic, ugly.*
		- *'The problem remains that grotesque is essentially something we distrust, the hidden demonic fantasy that still torments and attracts us, the shadow we repress because we don't want to confront this central problem in our society.'*
		- *"What I shall call American Grotesque comes, I believe, from two major sources.*
			- *First, the evangelical splintering of our country into hundreds of separatist movements with all the puzzles, repressions, and violence that the splintering has produced.*
				- *'In our frenetic attempt to conquer the west, tame the land, subdue and eliminate the Indians, we put the stern-zealot Christ to work. Thus we achieved often a grotesque version of Christianity.'*
			- *'The second major source of American Grotesque is the goal of individual materialistic success.'*
		- > *Treated with artistry and compassion the grotesque can console. Many artists, European and American, testify to this. The difference lies in tone. The confrontation of existential questions has led to savage comedy, black humor, the pursuit of style and techniques into abstract areas where human elements are increasingly missing. All of these pervasive problems of meaning and faith lead to dominant trends in the arts that lift technique above content.* **Art becomes the mask of art rather than the direct confrontation of experience.** - James Shevill
		- **European Grotesque**- *In the shadow of WWII, European artists  tended to reflect undeniable compassion in the urge to struggle and continue, to seek the necessity of companionship absurd though it may be in the face of vacancy. *
		- **American Grotesque** - *'Flows from a basic American optimism about the possibilities of democracy, religion, money, goods, power, conflicting with an increasing pessimism about the corporate and military forces that dominate our country.'*
			- *'The American concept of grotesque resists, crying through tangled webs of ambition, evangelical fervor writhing with the desire for material possessions'*
			- **'Grotesque** is the vulnerable, pathetic fantasy we distort in our simultaneous search for love and property. **Grotesque** is the mystery we eliminate to create the revolt of simple things, goods, that desire mystery. **Grotesque** is what we become when we seclude ourselves in the suburban community closed to wonder, the mechanical mirage of technological comfort.'
			- *'American Grotesque, the sad, searching patron of beauty, struggles to balance the intolerable weight of fantasies that shatter the sky with the glow of their singular distortions.'*
	- ### As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner - *Great God, What They Got in That Wagon?: Grotesque Intrusions in As I Lay Dying by Michael Gillum*
		- *'Of the dissonant elements that characterize the grotesque, one of the most prominent is the grossness of the human body.'*
		- *'The grotesque in art often reminds us that the body, with its smells, wastes, unruly appetites, and deformities, calls into question human idealisms and human pretensions.'*
		- *'In As I Lay Dying, Anse Bundren is a grotesque character partly because of his moral deformity: his lack of self-understanding, his parasitic and manipulative relations with others, his pious posturing. But he is also physically deformed and ugly...'*
		- *'We encounter one of the plot's central motifs: Addie's corpse is the grotesque body in its dark sense, a reminder of mortality.'*
		- *'The Bundrens continue to call what is in the box 'Addie' or 'Ma'...but the text does not let readers forget that what the box contains is dead meat.'*
		- *'The text deforms the ideal pattern of funerary ritual into the grotesque at every turn.'*
	- ### The Bacchae by Euripides - *The Bacchae by Siegfried Melchinger*
		- *'For Melchinger, the grotesque quality of Dionysus' retribution on Themes and its ruler, the ever-rational Pentheus, emphasizes the extremities of human nature and the consequences for remaining ignorant of them'*
		- *'The grotesque murder of Pentheus by his own mother results from his refusal to acknowledge the presence and power of the irrational in the city.'*
		- *'The Bacchae's grotesque scenes are indispensable to the representation of Dionysus and the contrary drives of the human psyche he holds under his sway.'*
	- ### The Birds by Aristophanes - *Empire and the Grotesque in Aristophanes' The Birds by Kalil M. Habib*
		- *'Humans may possess the strength to rival the authority of the gods and govern their own lives, but democracy may also degrade itself if its own power goes unchecked, resulting in a grotesque tyranny capable of devouring its own citizens.'*
	- ### Candide by Voltaire - *Optimism by Voltaire (Trans William F. Fleming)*
		- *'Satirically presenting a grotesque world devoid of justice where the idealistic and innocent suffer, Candide bears witness to the grotesque horrors of humanity.'*
		- *'Voltaire utilizes grotesque imagery to expose the ignorance of those who attempt to rationalize the world with little regard for its contents.'*
		- *'Filled with Voltaire's characteristically sharp wit, this essay suggests that readers approach Candide as a grotesque and satirical critique of Enlightenment thought.'*
	- ### Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes - *Heine on Cervantes and the Don Quixote by Heinrich Heine*
		- *'Heinrich Heine argues that Cervantes uses grotesque imagery and outlandish comedy to critique the chivalric romances popular at the time.'*
		- *'For Heine, Quixote is a grotesque satire filled with absurd character types that, ironically, actually populate the world.'*
	- ### Edgar Allan Poe's Short Stories by Edgar Allan Poe - *The Grotesque in the Age of Romanticism: Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque by Wolfgang Kayser*
		- *'Keysar concludes that the word 'grotesque' had 'two different levels of meaning [for Poe]:*
			- *'to describe a concrete situation in which chaos prevails*
			- *to indicate the tenor of entire stories concerned with terrible, incomprehensible, inexplicable, bizarre, fantastic, and nocturnal happenings.'*
	- ### Frankenstein by Mary Shelley - *Elements of the Grotesque in Mary Shelly's Frankenstein by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'Mary Shelly's Frankenstein does contain numerous grotesque elements and many more opportunities for grotesque descriptions. The entire premise of the book--of breathing life into a dead body--is grotesque almost by definition, and certainly for Victor Frankenstein himself is at least partially grotesque in his secret motives, unethical conduct, and perverse achievements.'*
		- *'It is such grinning and jeering--the taking of such obvious comic pleasure in others' pain--that finally makes the Creature truly grotesque.'*
	- ### Good Country People by Flannery O'Connor - *A Sharp Eye for the Grotesque in Flannery O'Connor's Good Country People by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'Discussions of the grotesque emphasize its typically incongruous 'mingling of the fantastic and the ideal, the sordid and the real, and the comic and the horrific.'*
		- *'...while still other commentators have stressed its focus on suddenness, surprise, and estrangement and its often violent juxtapositions of laughter and distrust.'*
		- *'...the grotesque effects of her fiction by pointing to her 'violent slapstick,' her 'penchant for distorting the human figure,' and the 'prevalence of caricature' in her writings.'*
		- *'The grotesque aspects of 'Good Country People' begin with its very first sentence, which describes the tenant worker, Mrs. Freeman, as if she were a machine:*
			- *'Besides the neutral expression that she wore when she was alone, Mrs. Freeman had two others, forward and reverse, that she used for all her human dealings.''*
			- *'O'Connor's consistently grotesque aspects serve the welcome purpose of encouraging us to take the characters, and indeed humans in general, far less seriously than they tend to take themselves.'*
			- *'All human and most fallen human behavior can seem comically grotesque.'*
	- ### Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift - *The Political Significance of Gulliver's Travels by C.H. Firth*
		- *'Swift's monstrous creation with its grotesque characters, such as the Lilliputians, standing just under six inches tall, holds up a kind of distorted looking-glass or mirror for the world.'*
		- *'Satire is sort of glass wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own, which is the chief reason so few are offended by it.'*
	- ### Henry IV, Part 1 by Youknowwho - *The Grotesque in Henry IV, Part 1 by John Kerr*
		- *'The grotesque involves primarily an excessive or distorted experience of the body.'*
		- *'Medieval drama provided another outlet for the grotesque. Reaching the largely illiterate audience at a public performance was made easier by bursts of slapstick, obscene language, and an occasional tirade against dominating wives or the current political leadership.'*
	- ### Inferno by Dante Alighieri - *Grotesque Renaissance by John Ruskin*
		- *'Ruskin attributes the success of Dante's grotesque portrayals to his 'mingling of extreme horror...with ludicrous actions and images.'*
		- *'Ruskin goes on to explore the grotesque's relation to beauty, claiming that if the same objects rendered by art as grotesque were perceived in their 'true light,' they would cease to disturb and become 'altogether sublime.'*
		- *'Ruskin's remarks provide insight into Dante's project and how his use of the grotesque may be related to the enormity of his vision, a vision so remote from and incongruous with livid experience.'*
	- ### King Lear by William Shakespeare - *King Lear and the Comedy of the Grotesque by G. Wilson Knight*
		- *'Knight claims that the grotesque incidents in King Lear incite a profoundly conflicted response in readers, one in which we are pulled between the sublime and the ridiculous, suffering and joy, Lear's madness and the Fool's penetrating laughter.'*
	- ### The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka - *Aspects of the Grotesque in Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'If any situation can seem inherently 'grotesque,' the act of waking up one morning and discovering that one has turned into a gigantic insect certainly fits the bill.'*
		- *'What could be more grotesque--to oneself as well as to others--than such a transformation?'*
		- *'The Grotesque, Geoffrey Harpham long ago argued, 'is the slipperiest of aesthetic categories' and has been defined in numerous ways over many decades and even centuries.'*
			- *'When dealing with the grotesque' it seems that 'one must deal either with gross generalizations, arbitrariness, or specific statements about specific works.'*
		- *'Kayser associates the grotesque with such elements as suddenness, surprise, and estrangement.'*
		- *'For an object to be grotesque, Harpham ultimately contends, 'it must arouse three responses: laughter and astonishment are two; either disgust or horror is the third.'*
		- *'The Metamorphosis is the story of any human being who fears finding himself in circumstances that are grotesque in themselves and that threaten to drag the person himself down in to the depths of grotesque thoughts, feelings, and behavior.'*
	- ### Miss Lonelyhearts by Nathanael West - *Carnival Virtues: Sex, Sacrilege, and the Grotesque in Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts by Blake G. Hobby*
		- *'Grotesque literature takes its roots in what Mikhail Bakhtin identifies as folk humor and carnival ambivalence, both of which he traces back to the Roman Saturnalia.'*
		- *'The Saturnalia was a celebration marked by revelry and freedom, a festival in which all Roman citizens became unified and equalized through participation in ritual irreverence to cultural norms.'*
		- *'Folk humor informs grotesque literature by seeking to bring all individuals to a common level, to collapse hierarchy and eliminate distinctions between social rank and class.'*
		- *'Carnival brings people together, and through laughter, disorder, and unusual behavior, it degrades all of its participants until they all exist on an equal plane.'*
		- *'Grotesque literature too, seeks to illicit a type of laughter that equalizes its readers--a laughter that celebrates the bizarre and perhaps disturbing, elements of life.'*
		- *'The grotesque operates in a second world, an alternative realm separate from the realm of institutionalized order and social protocol prevalent in typical daily life.'*
		- *'In this second world, what once was off-limits becomes fair game: the inappropriate becomes acceptable; the taboo becomes norm.'*
		- *'Formal conversation and the multitude of rules that govern it give way to a new form of communication: one in which profanities and abusive language become not only acceptable, but also meaningful.'*
		- *'Key to the nature of folk humor is the concept of ambivalence--that is, the coexistence of conflicting attitudes or feelings.'*
		- *'Out of fundamental necessity, societies since the time of Ancient Rome have used carnival and folk humor to cope with the oppressive confusion, monotony, and travesty of day-to-day life.'*
		- *'Miss Lonelyhearts shows the world as confusing and confused, and it shows the people who inhabit it as they cling in desperation to whatever they believe might keep them afloat while tumultuous waters toss them to and fro.'*
		- *'This is the world as Miss Lonelyhearts captures it: a grotesque place rife with ambivalent forces. Forces both obscene and pious, sexual and chaste; a place in which opposing realms of order and disorder, sanctity and blasphemy, collide.'*
	- ### The Mysterious Stranger by Mark Twain - *Grotesque Bodies in Twain's The Mysterious Stranger by Matthew J. Bolton*
		- *'Bakhtin's focus on the messy collisions between the official life and the life of the carnival represents a powerful counterpoint to the Aristotelian model of formal and thematic wholeness, in which a dramatic situation revolves around the 'three unities' of time, character, and action.'*
		- *'Counseling the rather humorless narrator, Satan tries to get the youth to see how incongruous, strange and hilarious man's behavior really is.'*

	- ### The Overcoat by Nikolai Gogol - *Reading Gogol's Grotesque Overcoat by James N. Roney*
		- *'Gogol's style requires his readers to be responsive to the grotesque, the combination of incompatible elements in a single whole with no dominant organizing principle.'*
		- *'A monster is a monster; a person is a person. Neither of these is grotesque. Grotesquerie lies in a single being with inseparable monstrous and human parts.'*
		- *'Gogol's story embraces and mocks political and moral readings.'*
		- *'Only the rare work of art brings us to experience the momentary insight and existential unrest found in a story like Gogol's.'*
	- ### Revelation by Flannery O'Connor - *The Grotesque Protagonist by Gilbert H. Muller*
		- *'Muller hails Flannery O'Connor's short story 'Revelation' as a 'triumph of the comic grotesque,' one whose protagonist, Ruby Turpin, 'turns the story into a punitive fable on arrogance, hypocrisy and pride.'*
		- *'Discussing O'Connor's place in the Southern grotesque tradition, Muller claims 'the grotesque was [her] ideal vehicle for objectifying [the] fears, obsessions, and compulsions' she perceived in Southern culture.'*
		- *'The presence of the grotesque, for Muller, 'suggest that the visible world is incomprehensible and unregenerate [i.e. unredeemed]."
	- ### Six Characters in Search of an Author by Luigi Pirandello - *Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author and the Grotesque by J.R. Holt*
		- *'In general the word 'grotesque' refers to the appearance of incongruity, distortion, abnormality, or just plain ugliness.'*
		- *'Normally we seek to avoid beholding such appearances because they elicit discomfort and pain (as opposed to the pleasure we feel upon beholding what is beautiful)*'
		- *'Since all art invites us to behold it, thus to experience aesthetic pleasure, an art that is deliberately ugly or grotesque seems to be a contradiction.'*
		- *'The grotesque aesthetic is a 'beautiful ugliness' because it breaks down our conventional notions of beauty, harmony, order, and meaning, forcing us to find sense beyond our familiar categories of beauty and knowing.'*
		- *'In the process, we come to realize that those familiar categories themselves are artificial, and as such can distort the truth behind appearances.'*
		- *'Grotesque art, then, employs distortion to correct distortion.'*
		- *'The artificiality of art, this illusion that as we view it we take it to be real, is part of what Six Characters is about.'*
	- ### Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson - *The Book of the Grotesque by Irving Howe*
		- *'Howe explores grotesquery in Anderson's portrayal of rural American life.*
		- *In his analysis of the novel, Howe discusses Anderson's explanation of the grotesque existence his characters endure, an existence where 'the deformed exert dominion, [where] the seeming health of our state derives from a deep malignancy.'*
		- *'A fable of American estrangement, its theme the loss of love.'*

	- ## According to Bloom
		- *'The American revision of the poet-hero's journey has Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass as its Scripture...begins as a joyous quest for the authentic 'knit of identity' and starts a Great Decade of poetry...'*
		- *'The American poet hero's journey ends in a transcendence of death, a new mode of apotheosis...'*
		- *'Journeying both to his own and his nation's past [we] follow the hero's trajectory from childhood through poetic incarnation...celebrating the vision of a lost mythic America. '*
	- ## The Hero's Journey in Literature
		- ### The Aeneid by Virgil -
			- *Aeneas by T.R. Glover*
			- *'As repositories of myth, Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid express how two vast civilizations-one Hellenic, and the other Roman-understand themselves, seek to preserve the past, and envision a future based upon a structured social order seeking justice.'*
			- *'The self-sacrificing heroes of each of these epics complete perilous journeys, vying for control amid warring foes and intervening gods.'*
			- *'They battle for the founding of social order and undertake mythic journeys that demand perseverance amid strife.'*
			- *'During their epic struggles, key values emerge. These highly imaginative tales, set in a distant past, were intended to offer instructive stories for those seeking to survive and gain wisdom.'*
			- *'Both mythic worlds preserve the past, speak to the present, and define values for the future.'*
			- *'By comparing Greek and Roman epic, both of which contain larger-than-life figures that meet moral obligations through strife, early twentieth-century critic T.R. Glover argues that what distinguishes the two is Virgil's idea of destiny, one which Aeneas supplicates himself to the gods, embodying what Glover sees as Christian piety.'*
	- ### Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll - *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Kathleen Blake*
		- *'Kathleen Blake analyzes the games Alice plays in Wonderland and the way these games mark crucial stages in her journey.'*
		- *'At first, Alice does what the creatures tell her to do, following confusing and arbitrary rules as she goes from game to game. Blake contends, however, that, as Alice becomes aware of the freedom she has, she sees these games as irrational.'*
		- *'By becoming a 'spoilsport' and rejecting the rules thrust upon her, Alice learns to control her own fate, assert her own will, and escape the game world she has created'*
		- *'Alice gains self-understanding and self-mastery during her heroic journey, despite many frustrations.'*
		- *'For Blake, Alice maturation parallels ours. For life is indeed a strange journey with games governed by many seemingly arbitrary rules we often do not understand.'*
		- *'Thus Alice's journey both mirrors and inscribes the way we come to understand the world.'*
	- ### Beowulf - *Beowulf by W.P. Ker*
		- *'Ker cites the Odyssey and the Iliad as epic journeys that symbolize the human experience.'*
		- *'Ker finds that Beowulf is indeed an epic hero and the Beowulf poem a testimony to the values both pre- and post-Christian-found in later literary versions of the hero's journey.'*
		- *'Thus, Beowulf's journey reflects the moral concern of a war-waging age and looks forward to the way the romance literature that follows this age builds upon them.
	- ### David Copperfield by Charles Dickens - *David Copperfield and the Emergence of the Homeless Hero by Beth F. Herst*
		- *'Beth Herst notes how David Copperfield marks a turn in the Dickens hero, this time combining two previously used hero types: the parentless orphan protagonist....and the natural hero-imperfect and fallible.'*
		- *'Displaced in the world, homeless and parentless, David, amid a pain filled journey, attains a 'full and integrated selfhood.''*
		- *'Whole Copperfield's journey is not complete, neither are ours; his herculean efforts and his perseverance raise this everyman's journey to heroic stature.'*
	- ### Don Quixhote by Miguel de Cervantes - *Don Quixhote by Sir Walter Alexander Raleigh*
		- *'Sir Walter Alexander Raleigh focuses on the chivalric code that determines the path Don Quixhote follows on his journey.'*
		- *'As one who dedicates his life to this code, Don Quixhote resembles a kind of religious saint.'*
		- *'His spiritual journey highlights the many rewards of following abstract ideals and the many illusions that such ideals suffer upon us.'*
		- *'Contrasting the Don's idealism with Sancho's pragmatism, Raleigh finds they are both aspects of the human journey, one bounded by imagination and grounded in reality.'*
		- ### The Epic of Gilgamesh - *The Epic of Gilgamesh and the Hero's Journey by Merritt Moseley*
		- *'One definition of a hero is a person, who through genius or courage or might can accomplish what a normal person cannot.'*
		- *'The hero, as a literary figure, is associated with the genre of epic.'*
		- *'The usual understanding of an epic poem is something like 'a long narrative poem describing heroic events that happen over a period of time.'*
		- *'There are two kinds of epic: the traditional epic told over a long period by anonymous tellers before being written down, like The Iliad or Beowulf; and the literary epic, written as a self-consciously artistic composition by a single author.'*
		- *'Epics of both kinds share several conventions with Gilgamesh: the large spatial scope of the action; the inclusion of mighty battles,  perhaps against a superhuman or semi-divine opponents; an arduous journey; the participation of the divine realm in action, as the epic hero's undertakings are important enough to engage the attention of gods; and a hero who is the greatest of men and sometimes even more than human.'*
		- *'Homer's hero Achilles is the son of a goddess. Gilgamesh is even more divine: He is two-thirds god, only one-third man. Importantly, though, he like Achilles is still mortal.'*
		- *'For modern readers, killing another living being, pulling out his tongue, and stealing his cedar just to make a name for oneself is ethically suspect. In [Gilgamesh] one's ability to remain alive after death depended upon leaving a famous name. And the way to win fame in this world was by daring deeds of violence.'*
		- *'If we think a hero ought to be brave but self-sacrificing, noble, modest, and good, then Gilgamesh falls short in all but bravery. He is, by our standards, vainglorious and boastful.'*
		- *'In fact these excesses, and the divine creation of Gilgamesh' rival, Enkidu, launch the events that make up Gilgamesh.'*
			- Ariel and Ivy
		- *'It doesn't matter if one is great, handsome, strong, ruthless, or of divine origin, all of which Gilgamesh was; one cannot escape death.'*
		- *'Gilgamesh does not die in Gilgamesh, but he does accept his own mortality.'*
	- ### Go Tell it On the Mountain by James Baldwin - *James Baldwin by Robert Bone*
		- *'Robert Bone explores blues as an important subject in Go Tell It on the Mountain.'*
		- *'A musical form derived in part from the African-American spiritual, blues, according to Bone, is representative of the 'New Negro' or 'Harlem Renaissance' movement as it is now most often referred to.'*
		- *'Bone contends that John's journey towards sexual and racial freedom also mirrors Baldwin's life. Ultimately, John's journey deals with identity, the sense of self he forges amid two ritualized ways of experiencing suffering: Christianity and the blues.'*
	- ### Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte - *Jane Eyre and the Hero's Journey' by Merritt Mosely*
		- *'When Charlotte Bronte was writing Jayne Eyre, she gave careful thought to what sort of heroine she wished to present.'*
		- *'We know that 'heroine' may mean no more than female protagonist, but with Jane Eyre, Bronte created a character to whom the term applies with nearly its full range of heroic associations.'*
		- *'As a heroine Jane had distinct disadvantages.'*
		- *'No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy, would have supposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother, her own person and disposition, were all equally against her.'*
		- *'Jane's lack of beauty-though sometimes it seems just the lack of preferred kind of beauty-is represented as a defect, but through the course of the novel the customary polarities come to be reversed.'*
		- *'Neither of Jane's two needs-for liberty and for love-are easy to achieve or reconcile. They drive the novel, which is structured very much like a pilgrim's progress, as movement through symbolic scenes.'*
		- *'There are five stages in Jane's progress, identified by the five places she lives in the course of the book.'*
		- *'There is not much about society as a whole in Jane Eyre-it is the story of an individual's growth and development-and particularly at the end, where Jane and her husband retreat to a Ferndean 'deep buried in a wood.'*
		- *'What makes the conclusion of Jane Eyre a 'happy ending' is not just that it ends with marriage-that is the conventional happy ending of the conventional marriage plot-but that it allows the heroine's journey to proceed, through a series of important personal growth stages, to a satisfying working philosophy and personal integrity.'*
		- *'Solitude is wonderful for freedom, not so well-adapted to love; but Jane testifies that she had found a way, driven by a strong, passionate, determined selfhood and aided by a providential system, to bring the two into harmony.'*
	- ### Julius Caesar by Youknowwho - *The Political Odyssey: Shakespeare's Exploration of Ethics in Julius Caesar.'*
		- > *To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he's doing is good or else that it's a well-considered act in conformity with natural law. Fortunately, it is in the nature of the human being to seek a justification for his actions. Macbeth's self-justifications were feeble-and his conscience devoured him. Yes, even Iago was a little lamb too. The imagination and the spiritual strength of Shakespeare's evil doers stopped short of a dozen corpses. Because they had no ideology. Ideology-that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and other's eyes, so that he won't hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise and honors.'* - Solzhenitsyn
		- *'As Solzhenitsyn's statement brilliantly articulates, political power is fraught with self-justifications that endorse a kind of 'end justifies the means' principle.'*
		- > *'The more corrupt the audience, the more brilliant the rhetoric. A good citizen speaks the truth and respects his audience enough to believe that they are competent enough to recognize the common good and virtuous enough to act in accordance with it. The flatterer assumes the baseness of his audience and appeals to its vices, cloaking his enticements in the beauty ofhis words. Brutus is austere, Antony charming.* - Howard Bloom
		- *'To be politically successful in Rome one must match a corrupt audience with a corrupt message.'*
		- *'The tragedy of Brutus is the tragedy of man's limited knowledge in a world where political decisions made from the noblest of motives can often backfire and prove catastrophic.'*
		- *'In the end there are no easy solutions to the ethical dilemmas that must be faced by those who thrust themselves into the highest offices of the political arena.'*
		- *'Shakespeare suggest that in the brutal game of politics, everyone must get his or her hands a little dirty, and often the dirtier one's hands, the better the chance of success.'*
		- *'...in Julius Caesar, a drama that painfully depicts the harsh truth that decisions motivated by concern for the 'general good' are no guarantee of success (or survival) in the political realm and the equally tragic realization that often the noblest of intentions can prove to be disastrous in their political consequences.'
	- ### The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkein - *Hobbits and Heroism by Richard L. Purtill*
		- *'In Hobbits and Heroism, Richard L. Purtill identifies Bilbo and Frodo's journey as a mythic one and myth itself as a tool for providing moral instruction.*
		- *'For Purtill, Bilbo and Frodo are everyday characters who rise to fulfill heroic roles, motivated only by loyalty and love of friends.'*
		- *'Thus, hobbits rather than human beings serve as models for what our lives can become; their journey is ours.'*
		- *'For Purtill, the hobbits embody the self-sacrificing love that the human journey necessitates'*
		- *'Throughout their heroic journey, the hobbits must provide answers to timeless questions: What is the nature of good? What is the nature of evil? How do good and evil operate in human beings? These questions confront the journeyer at every fork in the path.'*
	- ### A Man for All Seasons by Robert Bolt - *The Hero as Rebel: Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons by Scott Walters*
		- *'To examine a literary character such as Bolt's More in terms of the hero's journey, the first question we must address is whether the character is, in fact, an archetypal hero at all.'*
		- Bolt, a self-identified agnostic, refers to the deeply religious More as a 'hero of selfhood', a phrase that refers to the ideas of twentieth-century French existential philosopher Albert Camus as an exemplar of this orientation.'*
		- *'It is this type of existentialist hero, more than the archetypal hero figure, that More represents.'*
		- *'But there are other definitions of a hero that more accurately apply to More. Aristotle, in his Poetics, defines tragic heroes (and certainly More's death at the end of the play qualifies him for the tragic label) very simply as 'people who are better than average', and Campbell himself writes that 'the composite hero of the monomyth is a personage of exceptional gifts' who is frequently 'honored by his society.'*
		- *'This brings us to an alternate version of heroism that might be more obviously applicable to the case of Sir Thomas More: martyrdom.'*
		- *'...Bolt's portrayal of More as a 'hero of selfhood' becomes clear, and Campbell's definition of a hero rejoins the discussion. For Bolt's More, once brought to trial for his rebellious silence, does 'venture forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder" where he battles for the highest stakes a man can encounter-not his own life but his own soul.'*
	- ### Middlemarch by George Eliot - *Middlemarch and the Hero's Journey by Merrit Moseley'*
		- *'Set in the middle of England in the middle of the nineteenth century among middle-class people, it features moderate unspectacular deeds and states of being. It could hardly be further from the kind of setting and plot readers that find in The Iliad or Moby-Dick.'*
		- *'It approaches heroism in a way more appropriate to the realist novel than the epic poem or tragic drama."
		- *'Nevertheless, it demonstrates the possibilities of heroism in an essentially private life and even the domestic sphere.'*
		- *'During her journey, Dorothea Brooke shows a resolve and courage that match those of the more famous more spectacular heroes of literary history.'*
		- *'It is difficult to pinpoint just one clear hero in the novel. In fact, the subtitle of Middlemarch almost vehemently denies a focus on a single heroism or even a strongly narrative intention: 'A Study of Provincial Life.'*
		- *'If Dorothea's is the main plot, then the second plot is that of Tertius Lydgate, a high-born physician newly arrived in Middlemarch Bearing what Eliot calls 'spots of commonness'-features that ultimately mar his chances for heroism despite his noble intentions.'*
		- *'It is worth remembering that every significant character in Middlemarch falls short of his or her aspirations.'*
		- *'Yet the novel invites us to contemplate heroism, most often in connection with Dorothea, via allusions and comparisons.'*
		- *'Dorothea's failure to understand her own limitations may be a character flaw. Dorothea is introduced as a passionate young woman...She is the one person who cannot see the folly of her choice, in part because of her Saint Theresa-like desire for a greatness of life.'*
		- *'This initial delusion prepares her for the frustrating life she will lead.'*
		- *'If fulfilling her heroic aspirations by marrying and becoming a helpmate strikes many modern readers as insipid and disappointing then Dorothea's other kind of heroic accomplishment will probably be no more exciting. That is, she is heroically good; much of her goodness consists in passive and self-abnegating behaviors.'*
		- *'The finale of Middlemarch recalls the preface and draws together the strands of what Alison Booth calls 'everyday heroism.' Dorothea is heroic in a different way from the typical historical or mythical heroes to whom she has been compared. She is an unsung hero.'*
		- ### Moby-Dick by Herman Melville - *Moby Dick by William Ellery Sedgwick.'*
			- *'William Ellery Sedgwick sees Ahab's quest for the truth as a 'tragedy of mind,' contrasting Ahab's myopic gaze with Ishmael's panoramic vision of the world.*
			- *As Sedgwick argues, Ishmael's heroic fate lies in the way he confronts and resolves his inner conflicts, ultimately embracing a 'spiritual balance' he finds along the journey.'*
			- *'Without impairing his strength of mind and purpose, Ahab's monomania has all but possessed itself of Ahab. His noble madness still has its own consciousness and ends in view. But it is horribly disfigured and perverted by his monomania which held it like a vice.'*
			- *'Ahab's noble madness sprang from an excess of humanity. His monomania on the contrary is identified with mutilation. Truly a monomania, wherever it looks it sees only itself. It sees its evil in the White Whale.'*
			- *'Ahab's monomania is evil. it demands the ruthless sacrifice of love and preys on his common humanity. It implicates Ahab in 'the heartless voids and immensities of the universe.' He has leagued himself with them.'*
			- *'While the story of Ahab's pursuit of Moby Dick goes forward to its end, a drama of inner conflict is unfolded. A victim of his own nature, a victim of the tragedy of mind, Ahab would have been torn asunder under any circumstances.*
			- *His tragedy is far more bitter and more terrible because, finally his own hand is raised against himself. His monomania has all but possessed itself of his noble madness.
			- *Therefore, his humanity is all but hideously perverted as well as otherwise maimed.'*
			- *'He dies in the grip of his own evil, his heart racked by hate. His 'most brain-battering fight' has availed him of nothing. The problem of evil, the responsibility for suffering, these mysteries have eluded him in the end.'*
		- ### The Odyssey by Homer - *The Man of Many Turns by Albert Cook*
			- *'Albert Cook discusses Odysseus' character in relation to the chaotic events that befall him on his journey homeward.'*
			- *'Cook asserts Odysseus' complexity lies in the 'varieties of experience' he recounts.'*
			- '*From this perspective, Odysseus' heroism, adaptability, and intelligence determine his fate; his journey tests his skills and enables him to fulfill his destiny.'*
			- *'Thus, the many turns Odysseus navigates reflect the many sides of his character.'*
		- ### A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce - *On A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by Dorothy Van Ghent.'*
			- *'Stephen Deadlus is the kind of epic hero whose journey unfolds in his would-be creation: the novel itself.'*
			- *'While we never see Stephen write his book, the subjects he explores all hinge, as in Freudian psychology, on the use and understanding of words.'*
			- *'Van Ghent sees Stephen Deadalus as a heroic artist who insists 'on the objectivity of the wholeness, harmony, and meaning, and on the objectivity of the revelation-the divine showing-forth.'*
			- *'Stephen's epiphanies pull together disparate pieces of reality, creating a sense of wholeness.'*
			- *'Stephen is a kind of priest or prophet whose destiny lies in 'naming the names.'*
			- *'As one engaged in a kind of religious quest, Stephen imagines spiritual fulfillment as coming through words, the poem we see him write, the diary entries that end the book, and the way the young artist wields language as a weapon and as a tool with which to seek enlightenment.'*
		- ### Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - *Pride and Prejudice: Jane Austen's Patrician Hero by Kenneth L. Moler.*
			- *'In ancient Rome, the patrician class consisted of wealthy elite families.'*
			- *'In the English-speaking world, we tend to use the word patrician to indicate a member of the upper class who has most often inherited wealth and is, from the perspective of the common person, an elitist.*
			- *'Yet, although we tend to see such people as elitist, we also tend to expect them to use their wealth, power, and prestige to do socially responsible things.'*
			- *'Kenneth L. Moler focuses on 'Jane Austen's rather unusual treatment of a popular eighteenth-century character-type"-the 'patrician hero.'*
			- *'By 'unusual,' Moler refers to the way Austen parodies this character type in the first half of the novel, only to justify this character's existence later in the novel, the result of his growth and his ability to change.'*
			- *'Moler shows us how this derivative character type helps to understand the theme of 'art vs. nature' in Jane Austen and other 19th-century authors' works.'*
			- *'The patrician hero is part o fa symbolic relationship that encompasses the antithesis between 'art' and nature.'*
			- *'Darcy and Elizabeth form such a relationship, a dramatic union in which 'two complex, sensitive and often blindly wrong-headed 'intricate characters'...progress toward a better understanding of one another, the world, and themselves.'*
			- *'The heroic journey the two undertake is a testimony to our ultimate mutability, our ability to understand more about each other, and our ability to change.'*
			- ### Sir Gawain and the Green Knight - *Sir Gawain's Unfulfilled/Unfulfilling Quest by Michael G. Cornelius*
				- *The fourteenth-century alliterative romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a classic example of heroic questing literature and one of the finest medieval epic romances every composed in the English language.'* (yeesh)
				- *'Gawain's expedition was never meant to be a triumph. As Shedd describes it, Gawain's quest, 'constitutes a glaring violation of the traditional success-story pattern' specific to the genre.'*
				- *'In describing the questing nature of Gawain, Sadowski writes, 'the story of Sir Gawain as a particular literary manifestation of the standard epic heroic biography symbolically describes human life conceived as a pursuit of higher spiritual values, attained through a series of tests and trials of physical, psychological, and moral nature.' It is through these trials that the questing hero finds fulfillment.'*
				- *'Through his failure, Gawain has achieved 'self-discovery' and in this 'self-discovery the hero made a beginning.'*
				- *'The unfilled and unfulfilling nature of his great quest has perhaps taught Gawain a valuable and important lesson about the realities of human existence and the fraits of his own knightly code.'*
			- ### To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee - *Stand up; your father's passing: Atticus Finch as Hero Archetype.'*
				- *'Perhaps the question of why To Kill a Mockingbird has remained both popular and critically acclaimed for several generations can be answered by the nature of the readers attraction to the character of Atticus Finch as the consummate hero.'*
				- *'Joseph Campbell argued that the hero is 'someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself,' and this can certainly be said of Atticus.'*
				- *'But the nature of his heroism is romantic-he manages to elevate local struggles, victories, and failures to global proportions, showing the reader the most fundamental kinds of ethical behavior and their great consequences.'*
				- *'As a heroic father, Atticus conveys wisdom, yet this wisdom is anything but conventional, as is his unexpected shooting of the rabid dog.'*
				- *'Atticus also shows that there are many ways to fight without physical beating. His conversation with Scout forbidding her to fight, regardless of the reason, leads into a discussion of the reason for the fight: disparaging accusations against Atticus because he is defending Tom Robinson.'*
				- *'Scout wants to know why he is doing it if so many people are against him, and he responds, 'the main reason that if I didn't, I couldn't hold my head up in town. I couldn't even tell you or Jem not to do something again.'*
				- *'Atticus's integrity as a parent-indeed as a person-is at stake, and he will not be a hypocrite. He is attempting to teach by example, showing that one doesn't lower oneself by a physical fight, as he exercises restraint on multiple occasions with Bob Ewell, even when Ewell spits in his face.'*
				- *'However, Atticus himself acknowledges that there is no shielding the children from the harsh truths of the world. The role of the hero, in fact, is not to block the harsh or dangerous consequences of the world entirely but to protect and, in so doing, reinforce fundamental values and recognition of truths.'*
				- collapsed:: true
				  > *A legendary hero is usually the founder of something-the founder of a new age, the founder of a new religion, the founder of a new city, the founder of a new a way of life. In order to found something new, one has to leave the old and go in quest of the seed idea, a germinal idea that will have the potentiality of bringing forth that new thing.* - Joseph Campbell
					- *'This is often the central quest of the hero: to venture into the wilderness in search of something meaningful to humanity, that will bring humanity to a new level.'*
				- *'This is often the central quest of the hero: to venture into the wilderness in search of something meaningful to humanity, that will bring humanity to a new level.'*
			- *'Campbell acknowledges that quite often, once the hero returns from his journey and its trials, the world rejects what he brings back, adding that 'it isn't always so much that the world doesn't want the gift, but that it doesn't know how to receive it and how to institutionalize it'*
			- *'Atticus's propositions regarding equality and duty are rejected by the populace, who are not ready to hear them-or to live them'*
			- 'This is why Atticus's defeat becomes akin to the hero's sacrifice.'*
			- *'Everyday heroics are the most important kind because the extraordinary circumstances that promote change and growth arise out of the everyday assumptions and consequences that bring either complacency or action.'*
			- *'As Atticus faces trials and makes sacrifices, Lee highlights the various issues of race, class, family, and social stagnation that make him an archetypal hero and perhaps the main reason for the book's endurance.'*
		- ### The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts by Maxine Hong Kingston - *The Woman Warrior and the Hero's Journey by Lauren P. De La Vars*
			- *'In some ways, The Woman Warrior is a realistic work dealing with an American life and an immigrant family...an autobiography of a girl's claiming her individuality amid the clamor of Chinese and AMerican expectations for girls and women.'*
			- *'Kingston's deliberate thwarting of readers' expectations about the genres of fiction, autobiography, and even of anthropological analysis reflects the instability of her own growing up between two powerful and, to her adolescent mind, prescriptive and unforgiving cultures.'*
			- *'The Woman Warrior traces these primary themes: the female hero or woman warrior; the complex relation of mothers and daughters; female silence; and the multifarious uses of storytelling.'*
			- *'The narrator presents her search for her own identity through re-presenting the actions and choices of these other Chinese women, some legendary, some her own relatives, some pitiable or selfish, some heroic.'*
			- *'In the last pages of the work, the narrator marks her achievement: She has established an identity separate from her mother's but knotted into its traditions and equally capable of survival and success.'*
			- *'Daughters and mothers are intertwined in this book and not always in comfortable ways. The happiest mother-daughter pairs are the ones brought together by fate, not by biology.'*
			- *'The narrator suffers agonies of resentment and rage because of her mother's high-handedness, her bossiness, and her inability to accommodate the American cultural differences her children are forced to accept at public school.'*
			- *'Nevertheless, women must speak in order to teach, even if silence and obedience are the lessons. 'You must not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.'*
			- *'For Kingston, female silence equals female invisibility; having no name means having no identity. The narrator is caught in a web of contradictions. Her Chinese culture values the silent, virtuous, passive woman, though it celebrates legends of avenging swordswomen.'*
		- ### The Worn Path by Eudora Welty - *The Worn Path and the Hero's Journey by Jean Shepard Hamm*
			- *'First published in 1941, 'The Worn Path' describes Phoenix Jackson's journey to a doctor's office in Natchez, Mississippi, where she acquires soothing medication for her ill grandson.'*
			- *'Poor, black, and old, Phoenix must undertake the journey alone.'*
			- *'Reading Phoenix with race in mind, we can see that the white characters believe they understand her.'*
			- *'To survive in the hostile wasteland around her, Phoenix has had to rely on her wits. She has had to create and re-create herself to meet the expectations of others.'*
			- *'Until Phoenix tells her story in the doctor's office, we do not know the true nature of her journey. Up until this time, we, like the other characters, may have been carried along with the stereotypes the story seems to reinforce.'*
			- *'The Worn Path, like so many of Welty's works, 'elicits expectations that it promptly defies.'*
			- *'Are we like the white characters in the story who superficially acknowledge Phoenix but never acknowledge her humanity? Or are we willing to question existing social injustices and our own acceptance of them?'*
			- *'Welty firmly insisted that her writing was not political by relational.'*

			- *'Freud suggests that thinking begins with the child's curiosity as to sexual differentiation.'*
			- *'Plato suggests we find Good by mounting the Ladder of Love, where eventually persons fall away and we are alone with Ideal Forms.'*
		- *'Shakespeare suggests that men are more narcissistic than women, and fall in love through the bodily eye, while women are far subtler, and can love more maturely.'*
			- *"No one has taught so urgently as Shakespeare that the sexual becomes the erotic when crossed by the shadow of death."*
		- > *"Falling out of love is one of the great human experiences; you see the world with newly awakened eyes."* - Iris Murdoch
		- > "Goodbye Lois, and I forgive you for everything I ever did to you." - Robert Penn Warren
		- *Shakespeare's men and women are molded by forces they cannot control, particularly the strength of the past, personal, and familial.*
	- ## Human Sexuality in Literature
	- ### Angels in America by Tony Kushner - *Queer Politics and the Politics of the Queer in Tony Kushner's Angels in America by Jennifer Glaser*
		- *Kushner portrays the apocalyptic landscape of America as the millennium approaches.*
		- *Kushner's treatment of sexuality in Angels in America melds the erotic with the political.*
		- *Kushner posits gay identity not simply as a sexual orientation but as an orientation to the world, one informed by the marginal position the gay culture has occupied, a position that for Kushner provides an outsider's view of mainstream culture.*
		- > 'Kushner maps the place where figurations of the Jew meet figurations of the sexual other, the deviant, the queer.'
	- ### A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen - *Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House by Kristin Brunnemer*
		- *Critical studies of A Doll's House center on the ongoing debate as to whether or not the play offers a feminist message, and whether or not Ibsen meant it to do so.*
		- *'Ibsen's characters throughout his plays find themselves in 'growth promoting' situations that allow them 'to look at [their] live[s] in new ways and to find new meaning in life.'*
		- **A myth of transformation** - whereby a character leaves behind her childhood identity in order to embrace an independent, self-actualized, autonomous one.
	- ### Don Juan by Lord Byron - *Thieves, Boxers, Sodomites, Poets: Being Flash to Byron's Don Juan by Gary Dyer*
		- *There is a fluency in technique of covert communication...that of Lord Byron in cultures of sodomy, boxing, and crime.*
		- *It is important to read a section of dialect in the work in light of its cultural implications.*
	- ### Farewell to Love by John Donne - *Two Problems in Donne's Farewell to Love by Katherine T. Emerson*
		- *Sexual language and sexual imagery in Farewell to Love is not meant to be taken literally but rather as part of Donne's rich wordplay.*
	- ### Giovanni's Room by James Baldwin - *Giovanni's Room and Human Sexuality by Lorena Russell*
		- *'Giovanni's Room explores an individual's shame and personal conflict as he comes to grips with his emerging gay sexuality.'*
		- *'Growing up gay in a homophobic society may have deadly costs. Homosexual identity is framed as a problematic site of personal struggle.'*
		- *'David's struggle to accept himself as a gay man is reflected in the struggle of self-delusion and self-discovery.'*
		- *'Giovanni's Room does not depend on a plot structure, but functions more as a psychological novel, one that works (as is typical in modernist fiction) through the interior psychology of the characters.'*
		- *'Much of society's prejudice against homosexuality is expressed through David's internalized homophobia.'*
	- ### Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov - *Sexuality in Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita by Paul Benedict Grant*
		- *'Humbert, like almost every other character in Lolita--heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, pedophiles, pornographers, voyeurs, and exhibitionists--is defined by his sexuality. It makes him who he is, colors everything he does, motivates every decision he makes.'*
		- *'Humbert's conception of love is inevitably seen through the lens of his lust.'*
		- **'Can sex and love co-exist when one's sexual desires are so obviously perverse?'**
		- *'Humbert's attempts to explain his sexual condition read like a series of excuses by which he tries to escape responsibility for his actions.'*
		- *'Sex without love, without a sense of morality and responsibility for others, is, as Humbert finally acknowledges, nothing but 'sterile and selfish vice.'*
	- ### Lyrics by Sappho - *Sappho and Human Sexuality by Sophie Mills*
		- *'Sappho as the lesbian in the purely geographical sense has now become the iconic lesbian in the modern sense.'*
		- *'The central paradox of lyric poetry is that it creates the illusion of immediate personal experience through poetic craft, which can recreate only at some distance the experience it portrays.'*
		- *'Sappho's poetry is shaped not only by her gender, but also by her aristocratic background and her sense of herself as a poet in relationship to Homer.'*
	- ### Lysistrata (Aristophanes) and Symposium(Plato) - *The Tragic Comedy of Sex in Aristophaneses' Lysistrata and Plato's Symposium by Brian S. Hook*
		- *'Students of ancient Greece are free to choose between two opposing views of Greek sexuality. Either the Greeks were very much like we are, or they were not.'*
		- *'In both Lysistrata and Symposium, sex and sexuality are central and definitive elements of human life and identity, much as the contemporary Western world views them.'*
		- *'Sex in Symposium and Lysistrata present sex in terms of natural desire, not in the terms of social conventions.'*
		- *'The essential nature of men is portrayed as sexual, chastity as unendurable.'*
		- *'Both texts present human sexuality in a comic foreground with a tragic background. The tragedy exists in the distance between the fantasy and the reality, and the many tensions between human desire and our understanding of it.'*
	- ### Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert - *Madame Bovary by Charles Baudelaire*
		- *'Gender and Sexuality lie at the center of all great characters.'*
	- ### The Miller's Tale, Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer - *Sex and Punishment in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Miller's Tale by Michael G. Cornelius*
		- *'The Miller's Tale is a fabliau, a genre of French medieval comic narrative that often involved lowbrow humor and myriad of sexual offenses.'*
		- *'Fabliau makes an ideal genre to comment on the institution of marriage.'*
		- *'In The Miller's Tale, 'to be a woman is little more than to be  the thing men desire.'*
	- ### Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe - *Introduction by Mark Schorer*
		- *"Women are depicted as tragic characters, functioning as a social commentary on a soulless, market-consumed culture."*
		- *'Many of the downtrodden characters are bartered and exchanged as sexual commodities in a mercantile society.'*
	- ### Much Ado About Nothing by youknowwho - *Much Ado About Nothing by Charles Cowden Clarke*
		- *'Clarke asserts that by portraying Beatrice and other female heroines as intellectually equal to men, Shakespeare had a positive 'intellectual influence' on the gender prejudices of his time.'*
		- *Clarke argues that their relationship lacks passion, being another example 'of the ninety-nine hundredths of the marriages that take places in society.'*
	- ### Oedipus Rex by Sophocles - *The Material and Sources of Dreams by Sigmund Freud*
		- *'According to Freud, adolescents often experience sexual desire for the parent of the opposite sex while also wishing for the death of the parent of the same sex as part of their development from child to adult.'*
		- *'Oedipus both kills his father and marries his mother.'*
	- ### A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce - *Joyce's Epiphanic Mode: Material Language and the Representation of Sexuality in Stephen Hero and Portrait by Joshua Jacobs*
		- *'Jacobs argues that Joyce deliberately and insightfully employs highly sexual language and imagery in a male character (Stephen Daedalus') 'epiphanies.'*
		- *'The sexual elements of the book reveal a  complex understanding of language and human sexuality.'*
		- *'Stephen's use of language in his erotically charged dreams, fantasies, and epiphanies from both the novel's greatness and its ironical nature.'*
		- *'The language in the novel is spoken from the perspective not of a misogynist but of an aspiring aesthete who attempts to overcome the typical proclivities we associate with juvenilia: lust, desire, and the ever-present preoccupation with human sexuality.'*
	- ### The Rape of the Lock by Alexander Pope - *The Rape of the Lock: A Reinfictation of the Myth of Passive Womanhood by Ellen Pollak
		- *'satire on a culture that objectifies individuals is itself a pretext for his own objectification of the author's own objectification of the female.'*
		- *'Pope enshrines passivity and subservience as essential qualities of the 'ideal' woman, a woman whose 'entire value is tied up with her identity as a piece of property transferable among men.'*
	- ### Sex of Myself by Walt Whitman - *Whitman's Song of Myself: Homosexual Dream and Vision by Robert K. Martin*
		- *'Whitman's 'poetry of vision' springs from 'the euphoria of the satisfied lover,' where the speaker imagines that the world is physically embodied in his partner.'*
		- *'Through this sexual encounter with the world, Whitman's speaker finds peace.'*
	- ### Sons and Lovers by D.H. Lawrence - *Sons and Lovers: A Freudian Appreciation by Alfred Booth Kuttner*
		- *'Freud's view of sexual development yields a great deal of insight into Lawrence's artistic practice.'*
		- *'Kuttner believes that Sons and Lovers is semiautobiographical.'*
	- ### Tess of the d'Ubervilles by Thomas Hardy - *Study of Thomas Hardy by D.H. Lawrence*
		- *'Lawrence expounds upon the dual nature of human beings, claiming that everyone possesses both a masculine and feminine side to their psyche.'*
	- ### To His Coy Mistress by Andrew Marvell - *Love and Lust in Andrew Marvell's To His Coy Mistress by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'The male speaker tries to convince a reluctant woman to have sex with him by arguing that since their time on earth is short, they must make the most of it by not postponing sexual pleasure.'*
		- *'Marvell...could have easily made this speaker praise this woman's soul as well as her body...The fact that Marvell's speaker is so obsessively focused on the mistress' flesh therefore invites us to respond ironically---with suspicion and sarcasm...his repeated protestations of 'love' a word he manages to repeat four times in in just the opening strophe.'*
		- *'We never hear the lady's response to the speaker's proposals but there is little in this poem that should make us feel confident that his lust will ever be satisfied.'*
- # THE LABYRINTH

	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664938825097_0.png)
	- ## The Labyrinth according to Bloom...
		- *'If there is a temple at the visionary center, then the circumference may well be a labyrinth.'*
		- *'Canonical literature has William Shakespeare at its center, while at its circumference his works form a golden labyrinth.'*
		- *'It may indeed be, as Penelope Doob shrewdly implies, that all truly literary text is labyrinthine, interwoven, interlaced.'*
		- *'All literary influence is labyrinthine; belated authors wander the maze as if an exit could be found, until the strong among them realize that the windings of the labyrinth all are internal.'*
		- *'Does any other image so fuse (or at least connect) high literature and life as does the labyrinth?'*
		- *'The ancient identity of rhetoric, psychology, and cosmology is preserved in the figuration of imaginative literature as a breathing, moving labyrinth.'*
			- *'Rhetorically the maze of influencings substitutes an ever-earliness for belatedness.'*
			- *'Psychologically the meandering windings are the defenses by which we-any among us-survive.'*
			- *'Cosmologically our labyrinth is the second nature we share as readers of the strong writers.'*
		- *'Gods do not walk labyrinths or perform labyrinthine dances: Hamlet and his peers do little else.'*
		- *'No critic, however generously motivated, can help a deep reader escape from the labyrinth of influence.'*
		- > *"I have learned my function is to help you get lost."* - Harold Bloom
		- *'The highest imaginative literature bids you to become utterly lost in it, with no Ariadne's thread to get you out.'*
		- *'What this labyrinth persuades you to do is just to keep reading, and not at all how to live and why.'*
		- *'Vico says we only know what we ourselves have made. If you inhabit a labyrinth, then you created it.'*
		- *'All labyrinths are illusory, in that they can be mastered, sometimes by cunning, other times by chance.'*
		- *'Themselves metaphors, labyrinths substitute for accurate directions, but what is can accurate direction within a literary work? All directions ultimately are at home in the capable reader: she herself is the compass of the sea.'*
		- *'Literary influence and literature are what Shakespeare called 'the selfsame.'*
		- *'Solitude is one labyrinth, literature another.'*
		- *'You cannot be a guide to a labyrinth, but to be sagacious as to literary influence is possible.'*
		- *'Reading itself may be a labyrinth but not to read deeply and widely is to be entrapped in the invincible labyrinth of ignorance and absence.'*
	- ## The Labyrinth in Literature
		- ### The Aeneid by Virgil - *Virgil's Aeneid by Penelope Reed Doob*
			- *'The labyrinth constitutes a major if sometimes covert thread in the elaborate textus of the Aeneid, providing structural pattern and leitmotif.'*
			- *'Doob concludes that the text contains a 'network of allusions that gradually shape a vision of Aeneas's life as a laborious errand through a series of mazes.'*
			- *'The labor and error associated with mazes are repeatedly emphasized in the Aeneid.'*
			- *'The poem dwells on* labores *of various sorts: works of suffering, achievement, and art.'*
			- *'If* labor *is the content of Aeneas's mission,* errores *define its form: the two concepts are as intimately connected in the poem as in a maze.'*
				- *'Success therefore, demands both the persistent patience of the passive unicursal maze-walker and the active intelligence that can chose the right path in a multicursal maze.'*
		- ### The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spencer - *The Prophetic Moment by Angus Fletcher*
			- *'In the Prophetic Moment, Angus Fletcher focuses on what he calls the 'two cardinal images for Edmund Spencer's prophetic structure: the temple and the labyrinth.'*
			- *'Fletcher says the temple and the labyrinth are 'poetic universals,' which are 'sufficiently large and powerful images to organize an immense variety of secondary imagery, leading thereby to an equally varied narrative.'*
			- *'Calling the labyrinth 'the image of terror and panic,' Fletcher explains how the labyrinth in the Faerie Queen forms a kind of continuum between 'Terror' and 'Delight' two poles that describe the epic itself and the experience of reading Spencer's great poem, which Fletcher sees the work of a prophet.'*
			- *'Temples and labyrinths have a singular advantage to the poet, in that they both imply special layout and a typical activity within that layout.'*
			- *'While both images suggest man-made structures-men have built temples and labyrinths-they each have a set of natural equivalents.'*
			- *'Temples may rise out of the earth in the form of sacred groves, while labyrinths may grow up as a tangle of vegetation.'*
			- *'The cardinal dichotomy of the two archetypes will permit the typical Renaissance interplay of art and nature.'*
			- *'For both images, the idea of design is crucial, and their stress on pattern as such gives Spencer's intricate poem a certain stability.'*
			- *'The images of a temple is strictly formalized, to frame the highest degree of order, the idea of a labyrinth leads in the opposite direction'*
			- *'Together the temple and the labyrinth encompass the archetypal universe of the Faerie Queene and in that sense their meaning is more than allegorical. It is a narrative reality within the epic.'*
			- *'Heroes come to temples, which they may enter and leave, and they pass through a labyrinthine faerieland.'*
			- *'The temple is the image of gratified desire, the labrynth is the image of terror and panic.'*
		- ### The Garden of Forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges - *Borges and the Legacy of The Garden of Forking Paths by Jeffrey Gray*
			- *'Ts'ui Pen did not believe in linear time but rather in time as infinitely bifurcating, 'a growing, dizzying web of divergent, convergent, and parallel times.'*
			- > *'That fabric of times...contains all possibilities'* - Jorge Luis Borges
			- *'To try to account for all possible outcomes would be to never leave the starting block, just as the idiot-savant Ireneo Funes in 'Funes the Memorious'....'*
			- Infinite possibilities at any moment require infinite time, i.e., eternity. In terms of a labyrinthine plot, the first set of forkings would induce paralysis: There would always be one more; it is not even necessary to speak of the forkings of every one of those forks.'*
			- *'In achieving what he had longed for, a story with a plot, Borges had to tell one narrative. The story's convergence--in one physical place and historical moment--of individuals, crimes, thoughts, and events performs the opposite of forking.'*
			- *'In the end, Borges, fascinated by the labyrinthine ideas of time, language, and the mind, comes down rather firmly on the idea of a world in which one must live one life in chronological time.'*
				- > *'The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges'* - Jorge Luis Borges, Other Inquisitions, 182.
		- ### The General in His Labyrinth by Gabriel Garcia Marquez - *Of Utopias, Labyrinths and Unfulfilled Dreams in The General in His Labyrinth by Maria Odedtte Canivell*
			- *'Latin American nations appear as if they still suffer from growing pains.'*
			- *'Their liberation from the Spanish yoke was one of the bloodiest among independence wars.'*
			- *'Like their human counterparts, nations undergo a similar experience, in the process of emerging as a state, nations wonder who and what they are and how they can better serve their citizens.'*
			- *'Garcia Marquez fictionalizes the last eight months of the life of the 'Libertador,' taking readers along a labyrinthine journey, detailing his last days in power and his death.'*
			- *'The general becomes a symbol of the desire of every Latin American, to have strong, well-adjusted nations, leaving the eternal pangs of adolescence to enter well-adjusted adulthood.'*
		- ### Great Expectations by Charles Dickens - *The Poor Labyrinth: The Theme of Social Injustice in Dickens's Great Expectations by John H. Hagan Jr.*
			- *'John H. Hagan Jr. details how Dickens's novel is a condensed guide to understanding the way nineteenth-century social classes operate.'*
			- *'Pip is caught in a judicial system that perpetuates class prejudice, a kind of labyrinth created by Magwich.'*
			- *'Pip, 'in becoming the focal point for Miss Havisham's and Magwich's retaliation-the one who is caught in the midst of the cross fire directed against society by two of the parties it injured, who, in turn, display in their desire for proprietorship some of the very tyranny and selfishness against which they are rebelling-becomes society's scapegoat.'*
		- ### The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling by Henry Fielding - *The winding labyrinths of nature: The Labyrinth and Providential Order in Tom Jones by Anthony W. Lee*
			- *'First-time readers of Tom Jones may be permitted the impression that they have stumbled into not a labyrinth but a maze. Recent commentators have made a careful distinction between the two.'*
			- *'Labyrinths are archetypal structures dating back at least 3,500 years and evident in numerous global cultures.'*
			- *'Mazes are of more recent vintage, first appearing some 600 years ago in the landscape hedges of the European aristocracy.'*
			- *'Labyrinths are usually unicursal; that is, they have one well-defined path.'*
			- *'Mazes are multicursal, with many entrances and exits.'*
			- *'Mazes are intentionally confusing, possessing numerous blind spots, dead ends, and cul-de-sacs, whereas labyrinths have a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end.'*
			- *'Mazes are puzzles, challenging the individual's ingenuity, while labyrinths offer a secure, assured outcome, given that one stays on the proper path.'*
			- *'If the maze emblemizes the messy, complicated secular world of individualism and competition, the labyrinth patterns a universe warmly suffused with a harmony, order, and certainty conferred by a benevolent, providential divinity.'*
			- *'Campbell analyzes the Cretan labyrinth story, deriving from it, as well as numerous other literary and mythological sources, a basic ur-narrative of the heroic quest, which consists of three stages: departure, fulfillment, and return.'*
		- ### The House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende - *Of Labyrinths in Isabel Allende's The House of the Spirits by Maria Odette Canivell*
			- *'The French novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet claims that as soon as a 'modern architect is given a project, he draws a labyrinth.'*
			- *'Mankind appears to be fascinated by the images of labyrinths, these connecting networks of intricate winding passages where the exploration of life and death is made possible and the study of the human soul can take place.'*
			- *'Labyrinths are a locus of spiritual growth, magical quests, and representations of human struggle where past, present, and future conflate into a single unit, an archetype fo rthe inner world.'*
			- *'In addition to serving as sanctuary for the novel's characters, the labyrinth also determines the novel's structure. The narrative follows a circular pattern beginning and ending with the same sentence: 'Barrabas came to us by the sea.'*
			- *'Characters, like the readers of the novel, must travel through strange and at times surreal spaces, with boundaries that are not clear.'*
			- *'Both male and female characters share this pattern of repetition: the men using violence as a means to obtain what they want, and the women loving emotionally stunted males who seldom return the bounty of love they receive.'*
		- ### If on a Winter's Night a Traveler by Italo Calvino - *Italo Calvino's If on a Winter's a Night a Traveler and the Labyrinth by Aimable Twagilimana*
			- *'Greek mythology has it that King Minos of Crete built an intricate structure, the labyrinth, which was designed by Daedalus to imprison the Minotaur.'*
			- *'The structure was so complex that the designer himself got lost in it, and Theseus, the eventual Minotaur slayer, needed a clue from Ariadne to find his way to the exit.'*
			- *'The labyrinth has been used as a metaphor to convey various ideas such as quest, pilgrimage, travel, turnings, shifts, mapmaking, games, contemplation, meditation, mutability, openness, multiplicity, complexity, encyclopedia, anthology, interdisciplinarity, anal sex, confusion, and even defeat.'*
			- *'For Calvino, the labyrinth was a metaphor for the complex realities of the 1960s characterized by the crisis of decolonization, globalization, and late capitalism, and its new technologies.'*
			- *'Most readers go to a book expecting a beginning, a middle, and an end, which gives a sense of closure, a conclusion, a resolution, or sets of answers to conflicts.'*
			- *'Calvino makes it a point to remind readers of conventions and expectations only to challenge them, blatantly refusing to gratify them, or purposefully playing with them.'*
			- *'Calvino's novel starts with a frame and then multiplies fragments of stories tenfold. These stories literally branch like the design of a labyrinth: a story line starts, to be later abandoned at a turn for the beginning of another story and so on and so forth.'*
			- *'To navigate this labyrinth, Calvino left us with five values in his last set of writings before he died: Sex Memos for the Next Millennium; (he died before he could define the sixth lol what a legend)*
				- *Lightness* (possibility of intellectual elevation)
				- *Quickness* (literature's ability to move us to higher intellectual desires)
				- *Exactitude* (linguistic precision)
				- *Visibility* (literature's ability to make reality vivid to readers, notably through the use of images)
				- *Multiplicity* (the contemporary novel as an encyclopedia, as a method of knowledge, and above all as a network of connections between the events, the people, and the things of the world)
				- *Consistency* (he died before defining this. pretty sure he did this on purpose.)
		- ### In This Strange Labyrinth How Shall I Turn? - # 77 Lady Mary Wroth - *The Maze Within: Lady Mary Wroth's strang labourinth in Pamphilia to Amphilanthus by Margaret M. Morlier*
			- *'Exploring the twisting paths and labyrinthine turns of emotional experience, Lady Mary Wroth's Pamphilia to Amphilanthus established a place for the feminine voice in the love-sonnet tradition.'*
			- *'Traditionally the ancient [labyrinth] is a place of entrapment. In Wroth's poetic corona, however, it becomes a site of personal discovery, an opportunity for growth, and an image for understanding the role of art in human experience.'*
			- *'Just as language can create and express confusion, it can also clarify experience.'*
			- *'The word labourith-and its pun on 'labour' - can refer to the advantage of working with language.'*
			- *'Wroth encourages readers to step back and see the corona as a self-enclosed whole. The labyrinth in this enclosure provided Wroth with the vehicle for representing and exploring an emotional journey.'*
			- *'The journey might not be over at the conclusion of the corona, but the processes of art allow for surprising, valuable revelations along the way-in the twisting paths and sudden turns of language.'*
		- ### Inferno by Dante Alighieri - *The Poetry of the Divine Comedy by Karl Vossler*
			- *'As a journeyer through the horrors of hell, Dante, the author and pilgrim, is both artificer and maze walker, the one who must navigate the complex structure of the poem and the labyrinth of the self.'*
			- *"Vossler demonstrates the way the poem's intricate details are related and invites the reader to enter an interpretive labyrinth.'*
			- *'Scenery and plot, main and minor action, are held together by Dante's inmost sympathy and rapt attentiveness. Sometimes he forgets himself so completely in conversation with a sinner, or at the sight of a monster, that the sinner, that monster, becomes center of interest and the chief action; sometimes he is so keenly and clearly aware of his own position, so collects himself and becomes so thoroughly absorbed in himself, that the whole of Hell seems drawn and engulfed into this inward swirl.'*
			- *'In Dante's Inferno there is no definite distinction between chief and subordinate action, chief and minor figures, scenery and drama: for the one passes unceasingly into the other, and this transition is poetic life.'*
			- *'The Inferno with its tangible realism is like a monster whose soul has no definite organ.'*
		- ### Kubla Kahn by Samuel Taylor Coleridge - *Symbolic Labyrinths in Coleridge's Kubla Khan by Robert C. Evans*
			- *'Samuel Taylor Coleridge's hypnotic poem 'Kubla Khan' is set in an exotic locale, features an all-powerful architect, and describes one of the most magnificent building projects ever undertaken.'*
			- *'The entire poem, in fact, can be understood as itself a kind of labyrinth--one that is full of puzzling turns, unexpected twists, and literally mysterious passages.'*
			- *Symbolically, too, the poem itself fulfills many of the traditional and figurative functions often associated with labyrinths.'*
			- *'It leads us both into and through a strange and confusing new place; it initiates us into a bewildering but also fascinating kind of experience; it is figuratively associated with paradise but also contains threatening or disturbing elements; and it is explicitly linked with the holy, the sacred, and the inscrutable.'*
			- *'By the time of the Christian Middle Ages, labyrinths had often come to represent (in the words of Wendy B. Faris) 'the entangling layers of worldly sin surrounding man.'*
			- *'According to this view, 'God perceives order in the design and may endow man with the Ariadne's thread of grace he needs to reach the divine center of the pattern.'*
			- *'Labyrinths during Christian periods thus often symbolize 'man's wanderings and temptations.'*
			- *'Christian's also sometimes perceived labyrinths as emblems of divine inscrutability,' and the movement through such designs could be treated as a 'symbolic substitute for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.'*
			- *'The labyrinth,' Cooper notes, 'is often presided over by a woman and walked by a man,' and it 'is also said to symbolize the world; totality; inscrutability; movement; [and] any complex problem.'*
			- *'Labyrinth, at one and the same time, permits and prohibits,' functioning as a 'symbol of both exclusion in making the way difficult and of retention in making the exit difficult; only those qualified and equipped with the necessary knowledge can find the center, [while] those venturing without knowledge are lost.'*
			- *Thus, Udo Beckler notes that labyrinths 'painted on Etruscan vases' have sometimes been 'interpreted as representations of a womb'-a meaning which would support the pervasive view that movement into and out of a labyrinth symbolizes a kind of rebirth.'*
		- ### The Labyrinth of Solitude by Octavio Paz - *The Labyrinth of Solitude by Jose Quiroga*
			- *'Written in a time of upheaval and transition, as Mexico struggled with its cultural identity and nationhood in the face of Modernity, 'The Labyrinth of Solitude is envisioned by Jose Quiroga as Paz's attempt at 'purgation, as medicine and cure to vacuous nationalism.'*
			- *'Paz's collection of essays chronicles and thoughtfully analyzes the forms of solitude experienced by those navigating the labyrinthine path towards self-understanding.'*
			- *'Jose Quiroga focuses on the dual nature of Octavio Paz's writing-specifically, the intersection of its aesthetic and political dimensions.'*
			- *'The labyrinth evolves out of, and tries to resolve, the dialects between myth and history. The prize at the end of the labyrinth, as Paz explains in the appendix of the book, is the utopia of the fulfilled human being.'*
		- ### Metamorphoses by Ovid - *Daedalus in the Labyrinth of Ovid's Metamorphoses by Barbara Pavlock*
			- *'According to Pavlock, 'While Orvid indicates 'an affinity with Daaedalus in the labyrinthine intricacy of his poem [Metamorphoses], as a poet he reveals his superiority to the archetypal artisan in the nature of his own material.'*
			- *'Unlike the windings of the Cretan labyrinth, are inherently linked to the concept of play, in Metamorphoses Ovid uses numerous forms of repetition.'*
			- *'Their aim is ultimately not to confuse the reader but to take him through an experience that will make him perceive the manifold paradoxes of the human condition more fully.'*
		- ### A Midsummer Night's Dream by Youknowhwho - *A Midsummer Night's Dream by G.K. Chesterton*
			- *'G.K. Chesterton analyzes how the play corresponds to the labyrinthine nature of dreams, finding that 'The chase and tangle and frustration of the incidents and personalities are well known to everyone who has dreamt of perpetually falling over precipices or perpetually missing trains.''*
			- *Vacillating between historical, thematic, poetical, and psychological approaches, Chesterton pulls together Shakespeare's complicated plot and forest imagery and considers how the characters negotiate the labyrinth of images.'*
			- *'A Midsummer Night's Dream is a psychological study, not of a solitary man, but of a spirit that unites mankind.'*
		- ### The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco - *The Name of the Rose and the Labyrinths of Reading by Rossitsa Terzieva-Artemis*
			- *'If we accept Eco's argument that any text is 'a machine for generating interpretations, ' we can easily see how a rich novel like The Name of the Rose can be interpreted on several levels.'*
			- *'The author passes onto the reader some of these obsessions: In the search for a meaning or, rather, in search for meanings, and the insecurity of interpretation, we give in to what Eco refers to the 'drift or sliding of meaning.'*
			- *'The theme of doubt directly contrasts the world of dogma and uniformed knowledge prescribed by the church and its Benedictine and Franciscan orders.'*
			- *'If freedom is based on questioning the obvious and the accepted, then the interpretation of holy texts and doctrines inevitably leads to the corruption of established dogma.'*
			- *'William, however, eloquently argues that there is a liberating and self-knowing aspect of laughter that is beneficial to the growth of the individual: 'Perhaps the mission of those who love mankind is to make people laugh at the truth, to make truth laugh, because the only truth lies in learning to free ourselves from insane passion for the truth.'*
			- *'This insane passion for the truth is what ultimately makes Jorge a monster in a holy disguise: Deprived of ethical discrimination between right and wrong, between evil and the good in life, he is easily transformed into an evil protector of  truth for truth's sake.'*
			- *'The labyrinthine dimension of the text is visually doubled in the labyrinth of the aedificium. On the surface, the chaos of doors, corridors, and mirrors that dominate the building have a dep, well-structured plan to them.'*
			- *'The man-made labyrinth also represents the labyrinth of language and preferentiality Eco posits as the heart of communication'*
			- *'The universe of the labyrinth that Eco calls 'an abstract model of conjecturally' is a challenge, yet a challenge that requires intellect and human understanding to make sense of it.'*
			- *'Readers can discover meaning in the many words and signs that fill Eco's labyrinth, and they have only to read them as they pass.'*
		- ### Paradise Lost by John Milton - *The Art of the Maze in Book IX of Paradise Lost by Kathleen M. Swaim*
			- *'In her study of the words labyrinth and maze in Paradise Lost, Swain focuses on Milton's 'manipulations of the maze design within Book IX...and other instances of maze words throughout Paradise Lost that prove to carry the same kind of implications wihth regard to the Fall and to Reason.'*
			- *'According to Swaim's introduction to this essay: 'Maze is first concretely offered as Satan's physical and spatial form in the serpent.'*
			- *'Descriptions shift from the adjectival 'mazy folds' to the static 'labyrinth' to the numinous vitality of 'surging maze.'*
			- **'Thereafter maze comes to describe abstractly and with poetic richness through incrementation, the verbal, psychological, and spiritual process Satan employs to controvert the reason and death of Eve and thus of Adam.'*
			- *'Satan creates a labyrinth of language and logic in which, imitating him, Eve draws herself into loss.'*
		- ### The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats - *The Secrets of the Sphinx: The Labyrinth in The Second Coming by Josephine A. McQuail*
			- *'Each millennium, history swings on its axis to its contrary tendency.'*
			- *'History, according to Yeats, spins out in cycles of colliding opposites, recurring every 2,000 years.'*
			- *'Yeats conceptualized the cycle by envisioning two intersecting 'gyres,' like tornadoes or cyclones, spinning in opposite directions, the apex of which is in the center of the opposed gyre (the rocking cradle of Yeat's poem signifies the shift to the other pole).
			- *'The gyre, too, has other correspondences in Yeat's poetry: 'Winding Stair', or spiral staircase, also is a symbol of the gyre, maze, or labyrinth.'
			- *'The year of the beginning time of the gyre spinning out of control in Yeats's poem would be the year of Christ's birth; the ending year would be 2000 AD--in other words, the beginning of the twenty-first century.'*
			- *'The greatest of Yeats's symbols come from the creative center of the labyrinthine human mind, from which all great myths, and all great poetry, derive.'*
		- ### Ulysses by James Joyce - *James Joyce's Ulysses: Dedalus in the Labyrinth*
			- *'Joyce has given us two immediate references to the classical labyrinth: the name of Stephen Dedalus and the 'schemata' that Joyce provided Carlo Linati and Stuart Gilbert as explanations (and promotions) of his work.'*
			- *'In that novel, we see Stephen's growth constantly through bird imagery:'*
				- > 'When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets.'
			- *'The escape of Dedalus is the promise of flying by those nets to create a new labyrinth: 'I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.'*
			- *'The center of the labyrinth is significant. Penelope Reed Doob points out that the labyrinth often may harness an evil or contain a secret, the knowledge of which becomes sort of epiphany. At the center of the labyrinth  then is something important, meaningful.'*
			- *'In many ways, Ulysses presents a labyrinth not as a challenge from which we must escape but one with which we strive with others toward the center, toward the image of Bloom reading a book.'*
- # REBIRTH AND RENEWAL
  collapsed:: true
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664347207108_0.png)
	- ## According to Bloom...
		- *'What is Rebirth? For Yeats it was a repetition of the Romantic incarnation of the poetical Character.'*
			- Walt Whitman, Hart Crane, and Wallace Stevens
		- *'The rebirth of a person as a poet is akin to the emergence of the hero, a transmemberment of the unknowing into tragic knowledge that tends not to be wisdom.'*
		- *'The rebirth of anyone as a saint or a hero is no longer rhetorically and spiritually persuasive. Yet the renewal of the self when Whitman, Jr. became the rough Walt captivates us.'*
		-
	- ## Rebirth and Renewal in Literature
	- ### The Aeneid, Book 6 by Virgil - *Introduction: The Sixth Book of the Aeneid by H.E. Butler*
		- *'Butler describes how a journey to the underworld, which he calls a 'Nekyia,' leads to a symbolic rebirth not only of Aeneas, but also of Troy in the future greatness of Rome.'*
		- *'The earth-stained soul must be purified of its sins ere it can come to Elysium, and how thence, all, save a happy few, when they have rolled the wheel of a thousand years, return to live on earth anew.'*
	- ### The Awakening by Kate Chopin - *Renewal and Rebirth in Kate Chopin's The Awakening by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'Edna, after all, is either a drowning victim or a woman who commits suicide; thus whatever 'renewal' she undergoes leads to her physical destruction, and what ever 'rebirth' she enjoys also results in her literal death.'*
		- *'Edna is not truly being reborn or renewed at all but may be instead merely be repeating tired, stale patterns from her past.'*
		- *'Is Edna, in other words, being reborn and renewed through her increasing attachment to Robert, or is she merely reverting to earlier patterns of thought, emotion and behavior?'*
		- *'Her death can be viewed either as a defeat (as the end of any possibility of genuine renewal and rebirth) or as a victory (as the very achievement of a symbolic renewal and rebirth through a grand assertion of metaphysical freedom)*
	- ### Beloved by Toni Morrison - *Renewal and Rebirth in Toni Morrison's Beloved by Blake G. Hobby*
		- *'Central to Morrison's depiction of the healing of memory is the power of language, as she states in her 1993 Nobel lecture: 'Language alone protects us from the scariness of things with no names.'*
		- *'Morrison speaks of language as the power to bring things into being, an influence of energy on ignorance and the unknown.'*
		- *'Beloved in its broadest sense depicts a way in which the tormented human psyche may heal.'*
		- *'Morrison depicts memory as a means of liberation not only from an atavistic future but also a form the imprisoning horrors of the past.'*
		- *'Embracing a Romantic aesthetic, [Morrison] lauds the poetic imagination as a force capable of grasping the wholeness of memory's worth, of being able to pull together those vital things that constitute meaning, while discarding what must be discarded to move on.'*
	- ### Beowulf - *Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics by J.R.R. Tolkein*
		- *'Beowulf is primarily a kind of elegy for the departed hero, who, in the poetic enshrining of the past, enables a past culture both to survive and to be reborn.'*
		- *'Beowulf describes a culture at a pivotal moment of rebirth in human history, one in which Christianity has begun to be integrated into a civilization that has preserved its past in an epic poem filled with monsters.'*
	- ### Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer - *The Opening of Chaucer's General Prologue to The Canterbury Tale: A Diptych by Colin Wilcockson*
		- *'Wilcockson focuses on the theme of renewal and rebirth, linking the budding spring world with the spiritual journey the pilgrims undertake.'*
		- *'The thematic link between the natural description and the pilgrimage is that of death and rebirth.'*
		- *'On the earthly level, the rebirth of springtime follows the death of winter and the drought of March.'*
		- *'On the spiritual level, men's thoughts turn to the martyr who suffered physical death, but who now is alive in spirit and active in restoring life-forces to the sick.'*
	- ### Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky - *Crime and Myth: The Archetypal Pattern of Rebirth in Three Novels of Dostoevsky*
		- *'Dostoevsky depicts murder 'as an act generated exclusively by the rational mind of the murder...a product of pure intellection, a rationally argued 'calculated' act of violence.'*
		- *'Rationality is explicitly linked with violet acts, but for Rudicina, rationality is more than a theme: It is an 'underlying pattern' reflecting 'the archetypal scheme of rebirth through transgression followed by suffering, or expiation, which informs the central myth of Christianity, the Fall of Man and his Redemption.'*
	- ### Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri - *To Can Grande della Scala by Dante Alighieri*
		- *'Dante's epic poem deals with the rebirth and renewal of those who have lived a just earthly life, a rebirth that is paralleled in Dante the Pilgrim's journey and in those seeking to understand Divine Comedy.'*
	- ### Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe - *The Damnation of Faustus by J.P. Brockbank*
		- *'Faust is condemned at the end of the play, he notes the title character repents, vowing to burn his books and also uttering the words of Jesus on the cross.'*
		- *'These words alone, according to Brockbank, do not affect Faustus's damnation, but they do indicate that a character that has lost his way has found it again in his last moments of life, proclaiming salvation for all.'*
	- ### The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald - *Boats Against the Current: Mortality and the Myth of Renewal in The Great Gatsby by Jeffery Steinbrink*
		- *'For Steinbrink, Gatsby follows the illusion that he can remake things and be born anew. But though Gatsby is the victim of a tragic fate, Nick Carraway, the book's narrator, may be viewed as an observer who learns from Gatsby's mistakes.'*
	- ### Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad - *The Journey Within by Albert J. Guerard*
		- *'For Guerard, Heart of Darkness represents the rebirth-by way of a dark interior journey- of both Marlow, the novel's narrator, and Conrad, its author.'*
		- '*The physical journey Marlow makes is also symbolic: It is an outward sign of inner renewal and also a dark representation of our inner world, one animated by a drive for life and an overwhelming fear of death.'*
	- ### The Holy Sonnets by John Donne - *Renewal and Rebirth in John Donne's The Holy Sonnets by Gary Ettari*
		- *'The speaker of The Holy Sonnets often despairs over feelings of personal unworthiness of fear of death.'*
		- *'The question that begins the sonnet reflects both the need the speaker feels for God's presence in his life and the anxiety he feels regarding the lack of that presence.'*
		- *'According to Donne, the trials that we endure here are able, if we possess the correct frame of mind, to prepare us to meet God.'*
		- *'For Donne, then, the paradoxes and contradictions inherent in The Holy Sonnets and in life itself are the only way to establish a fruitful relationship with God.'*
		- *'Donne can only experience joy when he feels fear of God's wrath--not because joy and fear are the same thing, but because fearing God means that God is an active presence in his life who guides his renewal and rebirth and affords at least the possibility of joy.'*
	- ### I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou - *Death, Rebirth, and Renewal in Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'Arensberg argues in passing that the work 'suggests a sense of self as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying, and being reborn, in all its ramifications.'*
		- *'Maya Angelou is reborn: once, into a life-affirming identity recorded within the pages of her narrative, and again, when she re-creates that life as author of her autobiography.'*
		- *'Mrs. Flowers seems associated with life and vitality, and not only because of her intellect, her kindness, her self-respect, and her respect for others. Her house is filled with wonderful smells associated with nourishment and health.'*
		- *'Mrs. Freeman is a powerful symbol and agent of Maya's renewal and rebirth, of her escape from darkness and silence, of her reinitiating into the human race and of her growing emergence into adulthood.'*
		- *'Mrs. Flowers is not only the anti-type of Mr. Freeman; she is his very potent antidote as well.'*
		- *'She is, as Maya memorably and retrospectively puts it, 'the lady who threw me my first life line and thus prevented her from drowning the metaphorical death of self-imposed muteness.'*
	- ### King Lear by Youknowwho - *Rebirth and Renewal in Shakespeare's King Lear by Gary Ettari*
		- *'The subject of rebirth and renewal in King Lear is a complex one, in part because so much of the play focuses on disorder, confusion, and betrayal.'*
		- *'The sense of loss in Lear's words is undeniable, as the finality. With the repetition of 'never,' the weight of Cordelia's death and the loss of his own sanity are palpable.'*
		- *'However, as Shakespeare so often insists, even in the face of such dire loss, there is the possibility of redemption and renewal.'*
	- ### Little Gidding from Four Quartets by Thomas Stearns Elliot - *The Later Quartets by Staffan Bergsten*
		- *'Bergsten characterizes 'Little Gidding' especially its concluding section, as a 'reaffirmation,' one where a recognition of old age and mortality gives way to a 'timeless, mystic vision.'*
		- *'The redemption of time lies, not in the negation or annihilation of time, but in the transfiguration of time in a timeless pattern.'*
		- *'Elliot attempts to move from the 'Midwinter spring' of the opening stanza to 'the unimaginable Zero summer,' a season when life is apprehended not as movement or decay but as perpetual pattern of rebirth and renewal.'*
	- ### The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka - *Realism and Unrealism: Kafka's Metamorphosis by Norman N. Holland*
		- *'Holland claims that The Metamorphosis is a kind of allegory in which Gregor's death 'parallels the Biblical accounts of Christ's death. Thus, satirizes Christians, who are only distressed, angry, and ultimately, cruel when a second Christ appears.'*
		- *'Gregor's transformation, according to Holland, 'dramatizes the human predicament...trapped between a set of dark instinctual urges on one hand and an obscure drive to serve 'gods' on the other.'*
		- *'According to Holland, Gregor's transformation and death force readers to a renewal of awareness, where we must confront, using Freud's terms, 'the cage of the id and superego.'*
		- *'The Metamorphosis, 'by its very unreality,' drives readers to 'see the realities, Biblical and Freudian, hiding behind the ordinary reality of the story.'*
	- ### Orlando by Virginia Woolf - *Renewal, Rebirth, and Change in Virginia Woolf's Orlando by Lorena Russell*
		- *'The main character of the story, after all, not only lives several centuries with little effect but also changes from a man to a woman in the middle of the tale.'*
		- *'Rebirth and renewal are centrally about character transformation, and as the novel concludes, readers are left pondering not so much the forces of change and renewal as they are the persistence of the character in the face of such dramatic biological and historical flux.'*
		- *'Orlando's formal and thematic treatments of renewal and rebirth are thus part of a broader modernist impulse to define itself in the context of broad-ranging cultural and political transformations...they reflect Woolf's long-standing interest in moving literature toward a new aesthetic.'*
		- *'Character in fiction is often very much about change. Readers are invited on the basis of these terms to judge how well developed a character is based on how much change the character goes through. Orlando matures through the course of the novel and learns from experience, but Woolf's treatment of time in the end means that Orlando is not so much about character rebirth as it is about adaptation.'*
		- *'For Woolf, an individual's capacity must be measured against what a particular society or historical era allows. Change becomes less about what an individual accomplishes through his or her agency, and more about how metaphorical rebirth results from cultural forces.'*
		- *'For Woolf, an individual's personality is not merely influenced by those events he or she experiences in a lifetime. Rather, the personality is an accumulation of historical experience that is carried on from ones ancestors.'*
		- *'In the end, Orlando comments more on social prejudice than the dramatic potential of human renewal and rebirth.' The story requires at least one thematic possibility of rebirth, as though Orlando's adaptation to the variable epochs and cultures can only be expressed through symbolic death and renewal.'*
		- *'By challenging common-sense notions of time, Woolf has found a way to challenge the conventions and expectations of traditional biography. (character)'*
		- *'[Woolf] invites us to imaginatively reconsider subjectivity, gender, sexuality, and time by considering the everyday possibilities of rebirth and renewal.'*
	- ### The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne - *Hester's Bewitched Triangle: Within the Spell of the A by Blake Hobby*
		- *'Girard describes how literary characters often act out of jealousy and envy and how novelists have enshrined characters whose desires dictate not only the action of the novel but also their fate.'*
		- *'The great irony of imitating an abstract ideal or desiring another is that they both are forms of self-centeredness.'*
		- *'Hester's darkened desire to be a martyr takes her out of normal human relations. She follows a powerful desire. Love, however is a powerful force and needs a guide.'*
		- *'Hester wanders through a spiritual wilderness, hope eventually appears: 'on a field, sable, the letter A, gules,' a sign of rebirth and renewal.'*
	- ### A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens - *Recalled to Life: Sacrifice and Renewal in A Tale of Two Cities by Arthur Rankin*
		- *'In his study of narrative structure and reading practices, Peter Rabinowitz points out that readers pay attention to openings and closings as areas that allow for rich interpretive moments.'*
			- > *Our attention during the act of reading will, in part, be concentrated on what we have found in these positions* - Rabinowitz
		- *'The movement of the novel's action from darkness and misery to Carton's triumphant nobility calls readers' attention to his sacrifice for his friends, which shines like a golden light, reflecting hopefulness amid despair and optimism overcoming cynicism.'*
	- ### The Tempest by Youknowwho - *From Shakespeare's Mystery Play: A Study of The Tempest by Colin Still*
		- *'Throughout his analysis, Still expounds upon the allegorical meaning and significance of Shakespeare's plot, characters, and images, arguing that they contain allusions to both Christian and pagan initiation rites and rituals of renewal and rebirth.'*
	- ### Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston - *Resistance, Rebirth, and Renewal in Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God by Deborah James*
		- *'Hurston's writing--anthropological and literary--aimed at giving voice to a community which society often rendered as 'tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences.'*
		- *'Janie discovers that in order to achieve real knowledge she must resist external limitations and expectations, becoming a full participant in shaping her own life. Thus she is reborn a whole person.'*
		- *'Janie demonstrates her resistance to external definition in the episode where she fails to recognize herself in a photograph as the one black child among the other children who live on the estate.'*
		- *'At the end of the day, however, Janie has only herself and her hard-won knowledge to rely on.'*
- # SIN AND REDEMPTION
  collapsed:: true
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664992061695_0.png)
	- ## According to Bloom...
		- *'Sin and redemption are theological categories, not literary themes.'*
		- *'Devotional literature is always an oxymoron. Dr. Samuel Johnson, my critical hero, was a believing Christian but he denied the possibility of a spiritual literature:'*
			- > *'The good and evil of eternity are to ponderous for the wings of wit. The mind sinks under them, content with calm belief and humble adoration.'* - Dr. Samuel Johnson
			- *'Calm belief and humble adoration doubtless alike are admirable, but they are not states of consciousness that animate artistic creation.'*
		- *'I suggest that ^^error^^, not sin, is an authentic literary concept, and that ^^recognition^^, rather than redemption, is the inevitable literary theme that emanates from error.'*
		- *'Error starts the imagination into motion for Honor and the Athenian dramatists on to Proust and Faulkner.'*
		- *'Recognition is the consequent answering theme.'*
		- *'It is not just error that is recognized but rather the power that abides despite the wandering ways of having blundered.'*
		- *'By 'recognition' I do not mean primarily Aristotle's tragic category of belated awareness, but a far more general literary principle.'*
		- *'Delayed recognition is essential to the highest imaginative literature...when recognition is completed, the play, novel, or poem ends.'*
		- *'Total self-recognition is anything but redemption, just as inaugural error is absolutely unlike original sin.'*
		- *'The morality of literature evades good and evil. Shakespeare is not interested in saving you or in solving your problems.'*
	- ## Sin and Redemption according to Literature
		- ### All the King's Men by Robert Penn Warren - *Sin and Redemption in All the Kings Men by John J. Han*
			- *'On another level All the King's Men is a novel about sin and redemption.'*
			- *'Willie Stark commits the sin of adultery, and his political blackmail is directly responsible for Judge Irwin's suicide.'*
			- *'One of the ways All the King's Men comments upon sin and redemption is through its depiction of original sin.'*
				- > *'Man is conceived in sin and born into corruption, and he passed from the sink of the didie(a diaper) to the stench of the shroud. There's always something.'* - Robert Penn Warren
			- *'Despite his lack of humility and professed amorality, Willie is at least partially redeemed when his life is struck by tragedy. The death of Willie's son forces Willie to reexamine himself and his conduct.'*
			- *'Jack Burden's story in All the King's Men is that of a journey toward self-definition and for knowledge that is essential for self-fulfillment. By the end of the novel, Jack achieves self-definition and self-knowledge, but at a price: the deaths of Judge Irwin, Adam Stanton, and Willie Stark, who all perish partly because of his amorality and irresponsibility.'*
			- *'In Warren's novel, sin appears in the forms of pride, unbridled ambition, infidelity, amorality, and irresponsibility.'*
			- *'Despite his initial good intentions for the people, Willie Stark falls from grace because of his lack of humanity. His redemption is implied at the end of the novel.'*
			- *'Cass Mastern seeks self-destruction in a war, thereby making expiation for his wrongdoing. Likewise, Judge Irwin kills himself rather than bending his sense of honor. Learning from both their examples, Jack regains a sense of direction for life, better understands his past, and becomes ready to live as a responsible member of society.'*
		- ### The Bible - *Enchiridion to Laurentius on Faith, Hope, and Charity by Saint Augustine of Hippo*
			- *'Among the most influential philosophers and theologians of the Western literary tradition, Saint Augustine of Hippo had a profound effect on how we write and speak about the nature of sin and redemption.'*
			- *'In his Enchiridion (handbook) written for a friend name Laurentius, Augustine clearly articulates his interpretation of biblical teachings and their philosophical implications for sin, redemption, free will, and the nature of faith.'*
			- *[...(The cause)] of things evil is the will of a being mutably(prone to change) good falling away from immutable good, first that of an angel, than of man.'*
			- *'This is the first evil of a rational creature, that is, the first withdrawing of good: then after this there found way, now even against their will, ignorance of things necessary to be done, and desire of things hurtful; in company with which are brought in error and pain: which two evils when they are perceived to be hanging over us, the emotion of the mind endeavoring to flee from them is called fear.'*
			- *'The mind when it obtains things desired, although hurtful or empty, in that through error it perceives it not, is either overpowered by morbid delight, or fanned it may be with vain joy.'*
			- *'From these as it were the fountains of diseases fountains not of plenty, but of want, all the misery of a rational nature issues.'*
			- *'But these are the common evils, both of men, and of angels condemned by the justice of the Lord for their wickedness.'*
			- *'Certain angels therefore through impious pride deserting God, and being cast down from their high heavenly habitation into the lowest darkness of this air, that number of angels which was left continued in eternal blessedness with God, and in holiness.'*
			- *'We pray, therefor, for our enemies, that the grace of God may prevent them, as it has prevented us also: but we pray for ourselves that His mercy may follow after us.'*
			- *'Therefore the human race was holden under just condemnation, and all were children of wrath.'*
		- ### The Poems of Samuel Taylor Coleridge - *Coleridge's Divine Comedy by G. Wilson Knight*
			- *'In this chapter from his study of visionary poetry, noted scholar G. Wilson Knight analyzes the allusive symbolism of three poems by Coleridge which, taken together, 'may be grouped as a little Divina Commedia exploring in turn Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise.'*
			- *'Knight first examines the imagery of Christabel, which, like Dante's Inferno, 'expresses fear of some nameless obscenity.'*
			- *'Second, Knight finds 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' to be a 'story of sin, loneliness, and purgatorial redemption.'*
			- *'Finally, Knight meditates on the sublime symbols of Coleridge records in 'Kubla Khan,'  where readers reach the 'marriage-point in life's progress half-way between birth and death: and even birth and death are themselves have mingled or married.'*
			- *'The final lesson is a total acceptance of God and his universe through humility, with general love to man and beast. But the specifically sexual is left unplaced.'*
		- ### Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri - *Dante by George Santayana*
			- *'George Santayana examines the metaphysical, ethical, and religious framework guiding Dante's poetic vision.'*
			- *'Drawing upon Platonic and Aristotelian notions of morality and cosmic order, as well as Catholic doctrines regarding sin and redemption, Santayana asserts that Dante's creation has a specials significance in our shared literary tradition:'*
				- *'Probably for the first and last time in the history of the world a classification worked out by a systematic moralist guided the vision of a great poet.'*
			- *'The subject-matter of the Divine Comedy is according to the moral universe in all its levels, -romantic, political, religious.'*
			- *'No man, as Dante says, could hate his own soul; he could not at once be, and contradict, the voice in his instincts and emotions. Nor could a man hate God; for if that man knew himself, he would see that God was, by definition, his natural good, the ultimate goal of his actual aspirations.'*
			- *'Violence, like incontinence, is spontaneous enough in its personal origin, and would not be odious(uncomfortable) if it did not inflict, and intend to inflict, harm on others; so that besides incontinence, there is malice in it.'*
			- > *'Precision and horror, graphic and moral truth, were never so wonderfully combined as in the description of this hell.'* - George Santayana
			- *'There is a kind of sensualism or aestheticism that has decreed in our day that theory is not poetical; as if all the images and emotions that enter a cultivated mind were not saturated with theory.'*
			- *'The prevalence of such a sensualism or aestheticism would alone suffice to explain the importance of the arts.'*
			- *'The life of theory is not less human or less emotional than the life of sense; it is more typically human and more keenly emotional.'*
			- *'Philosophy is a more intense sort of experience than common life is.'*
			- *'Dante...he paints what he hates as frankly as what he loves, and in all things he is complete and sincere.'*
		- ### Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe - *Goethe's Faust by B.W. Wells*
			- *'B.W. Wells explores the way the Faust legend has portrayed sin and the way Goethe's Faust inverts the myth of the fall, with a chorus of angels saving Faust from eternal damnation.'*
			- *'Faust, as he would treat the subject, would contain his views of man, of destiny, of ethics, and of the spiritual world.'*
			- *"Hence the general popular comprehension of 'Faust' as a whole in this period more than ever before, because more than ever before it reflects the popular mind to which as to Faust the 'logos' is neither 'word,' nor 'thought,' nor 'power,' but 'action.'*
			- *'The dangers of such a philosophy of life are obvious, some of them are already realized in the luxury of our hedonists and the socialism and nihilism of our proletariat, but 'Faust,' if rightly apprehended, offers two poisons, either an antidote of the other, which joined together help and strengthen.'*
			- *'Neither Euphorion's idealism that will not touch earth, nor Mephistopheles' realism that will not rise above it, but that just mean, that idealizes the real and realizes the ideal, that is the world-wisdom of 'Faust.'*
		- ### The Novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald - *Gods and Fathers in F. Scott Fitzgerald's Novels by James Gindin*
			- *'In his study of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novels, James Gindin focuses on Fitzgerald's doomed romantic heroes and his conception of original sin.'*
			- *'Arguing that Fitzgerald became more sympathetic in his late novels and less moralizing, Gindin shows how 'his concern for his characters increase as did his sympathy for their human struggles and relationships for all the questions they could never answer.'*
			- *'The element of morality or judgement diminished, and God or truth disappeared; the romantic hero, although still doomed, seemed doomed less by a moral order or original sin than by accident.'*
			- *'Fitzgerald's fiction always, in one form or another, reveals a strong element of moral judgement against which the heroes can be seen.'*
			- *'The Fitzgerald hero is charming, intelligent, impressed by the glitter of a sparkling new world, and sensitive, a special person in the sense that the romantic hero is always someone particularly sensitive, intelligent, and vulnerable.'*
			- *'But against the romantic hero Fitzgerald places a moral judgement, a stern rebuke, functioning either within the character or from the outside, which inevitably limits the freedom and possibility of the romantic hero.'*
			- *'The romantic hero would be God, would dominate through his own individual capacity, but the moral judgement demonstrates that no man, no matter how special in secular terms, can play God.'*
			- *'The hero is also, simultaneously, the archetypal contemporary American, the confident and eager representative of his country trying his talents against an older more universal moral order.'*
			- *'Jay Gatsby, the subject of the novel, is the embodiment of the American Dream: the mystery of its origins, its impossible romanticism, its belief in its capacity to recapture a past that may never have existed, its faith in an unknown future, its ultimate futility.'*
	- ### The Novels of William Golding - *William Golding: Island by Jean E. Kennard*
		- *'For Jean E. Kennard, William Golding is concerned with sin, and 'the great sin is to see everything in terms of self.'*
		- *'Like Anthony Burgess and Iris Murdoch, Golding refutes the Sartrean view of man as an alienated being in an absurd relation to the universe with what amounts to a leap of faith. He believes that there is meaning, unity, but recognizes that this is unprovable.'*
		- *'Redemption from the Post-existential dilemma, nevertheless, lies in each man's recognition of his place in the universal scheme.'*
		- *'Golding sees man as trapped in himself, 'islanded,' a condition he appears to believe comes inevitably with consciousness of self, with the loss of innocence.'*
		- *'As one might expect, metaphors of entrapment, cellars or prisons, and of absorption by self, eating, dominate the novels.'*
		- *'To what extent, though, can man be held responsible for this islanding of the self which, after all, happens to him inevitably with maturity?'*
		- *'And what, if anything, can he do to save himself? Golding suggests, most clearly in The Inheritors, that man in a state of innocence is an integral part of his universe. The separation of man from the rest of his world through consciousness is apparently Golding's way of defining original sin. At this point man is islanded.'*
		- *'Golding is, then, in opposition to the romantic notion of noble primitives. Human beings are not innately innocent, so human progress is unlikely.'*
		- *'Golding shows the children responding differently to the same object or event and the highly patterned nature of these episodes makes it clear that the reader is intended to read them as allegory.'*
		- *'The allegorical aspects of the characterization and the action lead the reader imaginatively into other worlds of the cultural macrocosm.'*
		- *'The techniques of characterization Golding uses in this novel are very similar to those he uses in Lord of the Flies; the characters function midway between realism and allegory.*
		- *'Through allegorical characterization Golding makes the reader relate his microcosmic world of Pincher on the rock to Christian mythology, and through references to Prometheus to Greek mythology also.'*
		- *'Golding has said that he would prefer his books to be thought of as 'myths of total explanation.'*
		- *'Like Anthony Burgess and Iris Murdoch, Golding refutes the Sartrean view of man as an alienated being in absurd relation to the universe with what amounts to a leap of faith.'*
		- *'Redemption from the Post-existential dilemma, nevertheless, lies in each man's recognition of his place in the universal scheme. Like Iris Murdoch, he frequently defines this recognition as love.'*
		- *'What convinces his reader is not the logic of his argument, but his techniques, those of the novelists of nightmare.'*
		- *'He forces the reader outward from the island of a particular situation over the bridges that lead in all directions.'*
		- *'Only from the machrocosm can one see that the islandis a microcosm of everything else.'*
		- *'Golding, as Kermode says, has found in experience and embodies in his own myths the truths that inform all others.'*
	- ### King Lear by Youknowwho - *The Human Bond, Loosened and Tightened: Ciceronian Sin and Redemption in King Lear by Scott F. Crider*
		- *'Shakespeare's audience believed sin and redemption were governed by the Christian Lord and his son, who redeemed humankind from the first sin of Adam.'*
		- *'In the world of Shakespeare studies, there was a time when all this went without saying; then, as Jeffry Knapp has argued, there entered a 'secularist bias.'*
		- *'Shakespeare's King Lear suggests that the only significant 'sin' is to loosen or untie the natural bond of association that joins human beings to each other, what Kent calls 'the holy cords atwain/Which are to intrince t'unloose.'*
		- *'To be sure, Shakespeare questions how 'natural' the bond can be, when characters routinely violate it.'*
		- *'Even if it is only a natural potential without necessary actualization (since human beings are free), the bond between us exists, according to Shakespeare, and it entails duties toward one another.'*
		- *'For Cicero, human beings in society share a bond or conjunction: It is strongest within the family, then the polity, yet it extends to all human beings as such.'*
		- *'One of the great ethical problems that he identified and explored is the apparent tension between the honorable and the advantageous-what he calls the honest and the useful.'*
		- *'Cicero argues that there is no real tension, and that anything truly advantageous will also be honorable.'*
		- *'His foundation for this belief is a principle of human society, a principle which takes precedence over any advantages apparently adverse to that society, even philosophical speculation itself:'*

		  *Now it is not in order to make honeycombs that swarms of bees gather together, but it is because they are gregarious by nature that they make honeycombs. In the same way, but to a much greater extent, men, living naturally in groups, exercise their ingenuity in action and reflection. Therefore unless learning is accompanied by the virtue that consists in protecting men, that is to say in the fellowship of the human race, it would seem solitary and barren. In the same way, if greatness of spirit were detached from society, and from the bonding between humans, it would become a kind of brutal savagery.* - Cicero

	- ### Moby-Dick by Herman Melville - *Sin and Redemption in Melville's Moby-Dick: The Humaneness of Father Mapple by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'No one interested in the topics of sin and redemption in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick should overlook the famous sermon by Father Mapple, which is the focus of chapters seven and eight of Melville's masterpiece.'*
		- *'Nowhere else in the book are such words as 'sin,' 'sinners,' 'sinful,' and 'redemption' used more frequently than in Mapple's sermon.'*
		- *'Mapple's sermon, then, is significant partly because it deals so openly and so insistently with ethical issues in general and with matters of ethics and morals, as well as questions concerning man's relationship with God, are key themes raised by the novel, as a whole, and they are central to the sermon.'*
		- *'If we take Mapple and his word seriously, it is easy to see them as implyi8ng a negative evaluation of the pride, sin, and lack of redemption of Captain Ahab.'*
		- *'If, on the other hand, we assume that Melville is mocking Mapple and his sermon, then Mapple can be seen as at least as bad as Ahab and perhaps even worse.'*
		- *'Mapple is indeed concerned with sin, but he is just as concerned with redemption.'*
		- *'Mapple is undoubtedly concerned with serving God, but he is also concerned with treating one's fellow humans with dignity, compassion, mercy and respect.'*
	- ### The Short Stories of Flannery O'Connor - *Light and Enlightenment in Flannery O'Connor's Fiction by Patricia D. Maida*
		- *'The Momentum of Flannery O'Connor's fiction is basically hopefully in assessing man's limitations amid the constant possibility of redemption.'*
		- *'Although man is thwarted by his lack of vision, the light remains a hovering presence-ready to pursue, if necessary, the recalcitrant.'*
		- *'The process of enlightenment, so basic to O'Connor's works, is reinforced by natural imagery-through the tree-line, the sun, and the color purple.'*
		- *'Maida describes how natural imagery signifies the spiritual experience of O'Connor's characters as they sin and are redeemed.'*
		- *'Vision functions as the dynamic principle in Flannery O'Connor's fiction.'*
		- *'From her first novel Wise Blood, through The Violent Bear It Away, and in both collections of short stories, O'Connor portrays characters who are morally blind.'*
		- *'Her people project their true selves through the physical qualities of their eyes-through color, shape, and intensity. And their perception of the world is controlled by their limited powers of sight.'*
		- *'The reader enters this world through the eyes of the characters, experiencing an environment fraught with extraordinary signs in the form of natural imagery.'*
		- *'Among the recurring images a triad dominates: the tree-line, the sun, and the color purple.'*
		- *'The tree-line suggests a delineation between the known and the unknown.'*
		- *'The sun reflects light or enlightenment; and the color purple indicates bruising and pain.'*
		- *'But on the metaphysical level, this triad represents an existential awareness and a spiritual process.'*
		- *'The focus on the eyes of the characters not only provides greater insight for the reader, but it also increases the reader's awareness of the conflict between individual perception and truth.'*
		- *'Vision controls not only the way a person views himself and others, but also the way he perceives nature.'*
		- *'Sudden consciousness of the tree-line on the part of a character foreshadows an impending crisis.'*
		- *'Sun images work along with the tree-line images to convey impending light or enlightenment.'*
		- *'She manages to evoke a sense of redemptive process throughout her works, however, by reinforcing the moment of truth with symbolic imagery.'*
		- *'The fusion of character, situation, and imagery culminates in a unique experience, a metaphysical awakening, a spiritual illumination.'*
	- ### Paradise Lost by John Milton - *Ingratitude as Sin in Milton's Paradise Lost*
		- *'Why was it wrong for Eve and Adam to taste the forbidden fruit in Paradise? Many biblical interpreters have invoked the sin of pride, or wanting to rise above humans' rightful place in the scale of being.'*
		- *'The Genesis text does support that view, since the serpent promises Eve 'that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.'*
		- *'However, John Milton interpreted Scripture in his own way. In Paradise Lost, he does not imagine Eve as motivated by foolish pride or desire to rival God. In Milton's interpretation of the Fall, the primal sin was not pride but simply disobedience.'*
		- *'The arch-rebel Satan is the villain, and Eve, who apparently thinks she is acting virtuously and courageously, receives a sentence of death for the petty crime of eating a piece of stolen fruit.'*
		- *'So, although Milton rejects political hierarchy in human affairs, he asserts a hierarchy in the cosmos: God over angels and humans, humans over the animals and the Earth.'*
		- *'The unequal relationship between the Father and his creatures justifies God's requirement of obedience.'*
		- *'The arbitrariness of the prohibition raises the question whether it was truly wrong in an ethical sense to eat the fruit. Milton was a 'moral realist' that is, one who thought right and wrong are objectively real categories. Rightness and wrongness are not created/defined by God's will and decree, as John Calvin and many other Protestants believed, but rather God wills and decrees what is (already) inherently right.*
		- *'The answer that unfolds is this: Though the fruit itself is morally neutral, the eating is not, because the eating is disobedient, and disobedience to God is objectively wrong in the world of Paradise Lost.'*
		- *'The idea of obedience in Paradise Lost is grounded in the knowledge of being created and in the knowledge of one's creator. Self-understanding creatures accept their subordinate position and feel grateful for their existence.'*
		- *'Paradise Lost seeks to shield God against the charge of irrational bullying.'*
	- ### The Pardoner's Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer - *The Pardoner's Homosexuality and How It Matters*
		- *'Chaucer's The Pardoner's Tale focuses on a trickster who plays to human guilt, in his own allegory of sin and the need for redemption.'*
		- *'Monice E. McAlpine suggests that Chaucer makes a daring move in portraying the Pardoner as not only a sinner and homosexual but also a fellow pilgrim, who, along with other members of the social strata, seeks redemption as he travels to Canterbury.'*
		- *'The term 'mare,' in particular, has proved notoriously difficult for modern readers to interpret, and even when the term is glossed, the possibility that the Pardoner may be a 'mare' is often ignored in favor of the belief that he is certainly a 'geldyng,' or eunuch.'*
		- *'Through his manipulation of the sacrament of penance, the Pardoner covertly seeks forgiveness for what he takes to be his sinful condition; through his manipulation of relics, he covertly seeks affirmation that he is in some sense holy.'*
		- *'The Pardoner lives his life through the church's rituals, sacraments, and sacramentals in a way that dramatizes both the pain of exclusion and the hope for ultimate inclusion.'*
		- *'Though believing himself the church's rejected son, the Pardoner has done everything he can to make himself a 'noble ecclesiast.'*
	- ### In the Penal Colony by Franz Kafka - *In the Interpretation of Colony by Blake Hobby*
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  *'The earth is a penal colony, and we are all under sentence of judgement for sin. There was once a very elaborate machine, of scholastic theology, for the pronouncement of sentence, and an elaborate ecclesiastical system for its administration. Now it is in process of disappearance: the Old Commander (God) has died, though there is a legend, which you can believe or not, that He will come again. Meanwhile the 'machine seems antiquated and inhuman to ladies, who are sentimental about criminals, and to the new governor, who is a humanitarian.'* - Austin Warren
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- *'What is allegory? Perhaps the best way to think about allegory is the story behind the literal story, a symbolic way of making meaning in which all the elements come together to signify something.'*
		- *'What we need in order to confront a text is the ability to read closely, thinking of literature as being self-contained, looking for formal elements such as rhyme, meter, setting, characterization, and plot and always keeping an eye out especially for paradox, ambiguity, irony, and tension. Such reading yields the ability to understand literature previously inaccessible.'*
		- *'Much of Kafka scholarship has focused on the parable as a form, one that enables Kafka either to encode a specific rhetorical intent or to capture the nature of paradox.'*
		- *'Kafka describes parables as mysterious forms whose purpose lies in placing us before what we cannot understand and putting us in touch with the suffering endemic to the human condition.'*
		- *'According to Fowler, instead of celebrating Christ as a liberator from sin, the story portrays Christ as the 'last proponent of the old stern law.'*
		- *'Alternately, Stanley Corngold in Franz Kafka: The Necessity of Fiction declares: 'In the Penal Colony' casts doubt on the fact of anyone's guilt and hence on the efficacy of punishment for redemption.'*
		- *'As reading much Kafka criticism reveals, two critics dealing with the same thing can allegorize the story and arrive at two completely different interpretations.'*
		- *'Franz Kafka's 'In the Penal Colony' places readers before a religious spectacle, a ritualistic sacrifice. We read about the horrors of an apparatus that inscribes punishment on the flesh, reducing a human being to silence as it scripts atonement for sin. Were it possible to walk away comfortably knowing that Kafka crafted a meaningful allegory and believing we understood what Kafka was trying to say, we could begin talking about how the story instructs, informs, entertains, and brings us to a point of closure. Yet Kafka doesn't provide this clarity and leaves us, as Richard T. Gray argues, 'without hope of interpretive meditation.'*
		- *'Ultimately, we are left with a horrific meditation on interpretation. More than anything else, "In the Penal Colony' deals with the way we translate works of art into moral messages. In that sense, the tale is self-reflexive, commenting upon the very thing Kafka knows we will try to do with his story: reduce it to something meaningful in a clearly defined system, providing pithy phrases like the ones the apparatus cuts into the flesh.'*
		- *'Rather than make a clear theological statement about religion, however, the story turns the very nature of art's ambiguity into a way of redeeming the world from signification, the West's wayward sin.'*
	- ### Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan - *Forewords by H.R. Haweis*
		- *'H.R. Haweis maintains that the book The Pilgrim's Progress 'did for Protestantism what Dante did for Roman Catholicism-while exposing sometimes naively its weak points, it affirmed its doctrines, and popularized their application to current life.'*
		- *'Haweis shows how Bunyan particularizes the Christian doctrine of sin and redemption to suit his audience.'*
		- *'From Milton we get our plan of salvation, but from Bunyan we get our conceptions of morality and our theory of spiritual development.'*
		- *'The impression a man of genius makes upon his age is in direct proportion to his intensity. The saints were vast accumulators of spiritual life. They were mighty reservoirs from which the people drank and went on their way rejoicing.'*
		- *'Emerson says the difference between great men and others is that there are more of them: they are many of them: they are many men rolled into one. They are macrocosms.'*
	- ### A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce - *Sin and Redemption in James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by Neil Murphy'*
		- *'Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is constructed around a series of complex, resonant parallels between the metaphorical language of Christian mythology and Greek mythology.'*
		- *'Joyce uses the imagery of Christianity to ultimately subvert its own substance, while initiating a transference of key Christian values to the artistic experience, or what Richard Ellmann called the 'transvaluation of Christian images.'*
		- *'The narrative design of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is built on an amalgamation of religious and artistic themes, revealed in both the mythic significance of Daedelus's status as an artisan and in Stephen's eventual reconsideration of himself as an artist.'*
		- *'Throughout the novel, the characteristic rhetoric of religious quest becomes infused with that of the artistic. Even as a boy, the forbidding imagery of sin, punishment, and hell is everywhere in Stephen's consciousness, framing his particularized sense of being in the world; his daily existence is perpetually condition by a profound sense of sin and punishment.'*
		- *'When Stephen later confesses his sins of the flesh, a sense of shame again pervades: 'His sins trickled from his lips, one by one, trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing like a sore, a squalid stream of vice. The last sins oozed forth, sluggish, filthy'*
		- *'The focal point for Stephen's salvation from his sins of the flesh is the retreat, during which the process of redemption is characterized by fear, a deep awareness, punishment, reverence, regret and sorrow.'*
		- *'Joyce's appropriation of his former religion's language to create metaphors that represent his vision of art is clear. But his decision to adopt the language of Christianity in order to erase the significance of the religious language itself is both provocative and ingenious.'*
		- *'Ultimately, the source of Stephen's redemption becomes the emblem of sin itself, which is subsequently redeemed by embracing reality. Stephen, like Christ, is resurrected from the dead and goes forth to pursue 'the reality of experience.' Under the guise of the savior turned artist, he finds redemption.'*
	- ### The Portrait of A Lady by Henry James - *Isabel Archer as a Woman Clothed in the Sun by E.C. Curtsinger*
		- *'By equating Isabel Archer with the Virgin Mary, Curtsinger explores the way Catholic theology and James's art intersect, each dependent upon the Great Muse (God), who invests his creation with a means of redemption from sin.'*
		- *'James's fondness of word-play is well known. His 'Adina' is an anagram of Diana; in naming his characters, James 'did not exclude even the most blatant of connotative possibilities.'*
		- *'Characters, descriptions, scenes, dialogue, all are touched by the solar metaphor.'*
		- *'In our modern pose we like to run from certain kinds of literary analysis, as from a burning building, with cries of 'allegory! allegory!'. The trouble with allegory is that it disturbs our ontological faith that a rose is only a rose, and also that a reader momentarily freed from such flower metaphysics may tend to invents his own silly version regardless of what the writer writes.'*
		- *'The allegorical thread I follow in the great weaving of the Portrait is simple, insistent, and clear. It binds together or illumines much that is scattered and puzzling in the literal action of the novel.*
		- *'By Christian tradition, Mary was of such purity that even in her mother's womb she did not bear the stain of original sin, had not, in other words, lost the Edenic inheritance squandered by Adam and Eve.'*
		- *'It may be that Ralph's and James's gift to Isabel, the Gardencourt inheritance, is a figure for Mary's immaculate conception and Isabel's purity.'*
		- *'We can surely account for nothing in the novelist's work,' James says, 'that hasn't passed through the crucible of his imagination.' The relationship of an artist to his art-however intimate and revealing-remains essentially mysterious. Muse may be only a pretty word for the imagination of the writer, but metaphor is dangerous. With the writing of the Portrait, ,the lady from Mount Parnassus is not merely baptized: she discovers that she is the virgin Mary.'*
	- ### The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne - *The Complexities of 'Old Roger' Chillingworth: Sin and Redemption in Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'One of the many paradoxes in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is that the character who at first seems the most sinned against eventually becomes the greatest sinner.'*
		- *'Roger Prynne, the old, scholarly husband of Hester Prynne, enters the novel as the clear victim of his wife's adultery. She has undoubtedly betrayed him, as she herself readily admits: 'I have greatly wronged thee,' murmured Hester.
		- *'By the time the novel concludes, however, Roger Prynne-who has adopted the symbolic name Roger Chillingworth-has become the darkest and most malignant figure in the novel.'*
		- *'The man who seemed in some ways admirable and sympathetic at the beginning of the chapter has turned himself into a potentially satanic figure by the end. By the time Chapter IV concludes, Roger Prynne (the innocent victim) has turned himself into 'old Roger' Chillingworth.' (the malignant sinner)*
	- ### Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God by Jonathan Edwards - *Jonathan Edwards by Leslie Stephen*
		- *'Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God contains one of the most vivid descriptions of hell ever presented and is a strong apology for the Christian faith.'*
		- *'In it, Edwards works to awaken his audience, to bring them to repent and atone for their sins.'*
		- *'Writing at the turn of the 20th century, Leslie Stephen explores how Edwards 'connects the expiring Calvinism of the old Puritan theocracy with what is called the transcendentalism embodied in the writings of Emerson and other leaders of young America.'*
		- *'Two of the ablest thinkers whom America has yet produced were born in New England at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The theorist who would trace all our characteristics to inheritance from some remote ancestor might see in Jonathan Edwards and Benjamin Franklin normal representatives of the two types from which the genuine Yankee is derived.'*
		- *'Franklin, born in 1706, represents in its fullest development the more earthly side of this compound. A thoroughbred utilitarian, full of sagacity, and carrying into all regions of thought that strange ingenuity which makes an American the handiest of all human beings, Franklin is best embodied in his own Poor Richard.'*

		  #+END_QUOTE
		- *'Edwards was luckily not an eloquent man, for his sermons would in that case have been amongst the most terrible of human compositions. But if he warms into something like eloquence, it is when he is endeavoring to force upon the imaginations of his hearts the horrors of their position.'*
		- *'Edwards will have no attempt to explain away the eternity of which he speaks; there will be no end to the 'exquisite horrible misery' of the damned.*
		- *'Edwards never shrank in cold blood from the most appalling consequences of his theories. He tells us, with superlative coolness, that the 'bulk of mankind do throng' to hell. He sentences infants to hell as remorselessly as the durus pater infantum, Augustine.'*
		- *Calvanism*
		- *'Edwards' writings a system of morality as ennobling, and a theory of the universe as elevated, as can be discovered in any theology. That the crust was thick and hard, and often revolting in its composition, is, indeed, undeniable; but the genuine metal is there, no less unmistakably than the refuse.'*
	- ### The Waste Land by T.S. Elliot - *Hints and Guesses in The Waste Land by Michael Gillum*
		- *'Although the concept of salvation might be applied in secular as well as religious contexts, a sin, properly speaking, is an offense against God or God's law. We might question whether there can be sin in The Waste Land, since God seems to be absent from the poem's world.'*
		- *'The empty world of the poem-the urban wasteland and the desert-is haunted by its absent God.'*
		- *'The Waste Land, only the piercing awareness that something lacking. The speaker sits upon the bank, fishing. Fishing at least is a hopeful activity.'*
	- ### The Plays of Tennessee Williams - *The Anti-Hero by Esther Merle Jackson*
		- *'Esther Merle Jackson focuses on the anti-hero as an image of the modern person in Williams's plays, claiming that such protagonists in Williams's works reveal 'the nature of suffering as it appears in the life of the twentieth century.'*
		- *'Jackson shows how Williams's 'catalogue of transgressors in search of salvation' reflects our search for meaning in the modern world.'*
		- *'One of the most controversial aspects of the drama of Tennessee Williams is his use of an anti-heroic protagonist as an image of man.'*
		- *'Williams appears to reject the Aristotelian concept of the protagonist and to substitute it for an anti-hero, the personification of a humanity neither good, knowledgeable, nor courageous.'*
		- *'Although contemporary dramatists accept certain aspects of the ethics of Aristotle, they do not feel that his definition of the hero is in every sense an accurate description of virtuous man in the twentieth century.'*
		- *'Arthur Miller, for example, points out that many aspects of Aristotle's system of ethics are today obsolete.'*
		- *'The image of man in the twentieth century, writes Miller, must be rooted in an open system of values appropriate to democratic society.'*
		- *'Tennessee Williams writes that the most pressing moral problem of man in the twentieth century is to avoid extinction: 'to beat the game of being against non-being.'*
		- *'The crux of the argument which has led to the modification of the Aristotelian hero lies in changes in the perception of experience, in the accumulation of new knowledges about and new hopes for the human species.'*
		- *'One of the most dramatic of the changes which have affected the idea of the hero that embodied in the science of psychology, for classic ideals of 'goodness,' 'nobility,' and 'courage' have under psychological scrutiny, assumed a significantly different aspect.'*
		- *'Because of anew sense of historical crisis, the hero, a man of action, has grown less appealing as an image of present moral and ethical aspirations than the anti-hero, a man of reflection and contemplation.'*
		- *'The substitution of the 'inner-oriented' ethic of the Christian protagonist for the 'outer-directed' heroism of the Greek hero is one of the significant contemporary adjustments in Western drama.'*
		- *'It is this change which has materially altered the idea of tragic action and which has produced a new concept of dramatic character.'*
		- *'In a discussion of contemporary form, Rene-Marill Alberes describes the contemporary anti-hero as a 'theological protagonist.'*
		- *'He is an image of man seeking to know the universe, to define its purpose, and to discover his ultimate meaning in its pattern."*
		- *'The contemporary theatre, like the novel, becomes a research and a quest. It makes itself idealistic, its characters force themselves toward that which they can never find.'*
		- *'For Alberes the anti-heroic quest is a journey toward moral commitment.'*
		- *'Williams' construction of his anti-heroic protagonist, his 'negative saint,' is based on a radical perception of new dangers for mankind, as well as on the recognition of new modes of courage.'*
		- *'Williams creates a protagonist who is concieved in anti-traditional terms. Brick, Kilroy, Catharine, Chance, and Shannon are not 'mankind' in the sense of classic, neoclassic, romantic, or realistic definitions.'*
		- *'They are images of a humanity diminished by time and history. They are each characterized by an inner division, by a fragmentation so complete that it has reduced them to partialities.'*

None of these persons who have attracted our great writers is remarkable in the sense of those who have preceded them. They are men like others, but they ask themselves certain questions while others allow themselves to live.'*

		- *'If the willingness to engage inner conflict is the nature of heroism in the theatre of Williams, his organization of character is designed to reveal such action by exploring, in relation to the protagonist, the full range of possibilities affecting his moral choice.'*
		- *'The anti-hero, in this sense, is not a man; he is a schematic presentation of extended moral possibilities.'*
		- *'In each of his characters Williams presents a composite image, a montage of the roles which together comprise the anti-heroic character.'*
		- *'In his presentation of character, Williams follows the method of exposition which in modern theatre is associated with the theories of Luigi Pirandello. For Pirandello defined dramatic character as an agglomeration of roles.'*
		- *'In this theory, Pirandello attempted to provide for modern drama a concept of character consistent with the relative perspective of twentieth-century thought: to create an image of man in all his complexity, in the full reality of his inner disharmony.'*
		- *'Like Jungian psychology, Pirandello's theory defines character as a loosely unified grouping of identities.'*
		- *'Pirandellian Man, like Jungian Man, is a configuration of masks. he is an image of man in search of reconciling symbol, in need of self above selves.'*
		- *'Although it was interpreted by Pirandello, this idea of character development should be credited to Shakespeare. Indeed, it may be described as the 'Hamlet organization:' for the anti-heroic Hamlet is perhaps the most effective theatrical example of this multiple concept of human personality.'*
		- *'Hamlet is organized from simultaneous visions in  much the manner of the modern anti-hero. Shakespeare rationalized his use of montage by attributing to his protagonist the consciousness of an actor.'*
		- *'A study of the work of Williams would seem to show that he takes this 'existential' Hamlet as his point of departure in his organization of anti-heroic character. For he seeks to affirm in character the present; his protagonists have little real past and no hope for a future. They are locked within a moment of choice. The form of Williams is thus a record of critical instant in individual destiny.'*
		- *'Apparently shocked and frightened by the growing threat of human annihilation, he suggests that the theatre cannot afford to exalt man, to praise and commend his nature. He insists that the proper function of the modern drama is to expose man's hidden nature, to search out his motives, to discover his limits, and ultimately, to help him find a mode of salvation.'*
		- *'The anti-heroic protagonist of Williams is designed to reveal the nature of suffering as it appears in the life of the twentieth century. He is intended as the object of pity and terror in the modern world.'*
		- *'A question is often asked about this aspect of Williams' work: Of what meaning is the fate of his emotional, spiritual, and moral cripples?
		- *'The answer given by Williams reflects the gradual usurpation of the pagan idea of tragedy by the Christian concept of human worth.'*
		- *'For the Christian ethic holds every man a sinner, redeemable only through love.'*
		- *'Williams' catalogue of transgressors in search of salvation is a true symbolism-his anti-hero, the very present image of man.'*

	- ## The Sublime according to Bloom
		- *'Shelley, who is a touchstone for the lyrical Sublime, remarked that the function of the Sublime was to persuade us to abandon easier for more difficult pleasures.'*
		- *'The history of the critical Sublime goes from the Hellenistic Longinus to Freud and beyond, since Freud's 'the Uncanny' is our modern form of the Sublime.'*
		- *'...the literary Sublime can be exemplified but not defined.'*
		- *'Shakespeare's sublimity is the richest and most varied in all literary history. Surely its heights-of heights are the great personalizes: Falstaff, Hamlet, Rosalind, Othello, Iago, Lear, Cleopatra.'*
		- *'They are sublime because they expand our consciousness without distorting it.'*
	- ## The Sublime in Literature
	- ### The Awakening by Kate Chopin - *The Awakening: Waking Up at the End of the Line by Barbara Claire Freeman*
		- *'Barbra Freeman first takes issue with Longinus's famous articulation of the sublime in the poetry of Sappho.'*
		- *'Freeman does so in order to point out what she calls significant 'misreadings' and to elucidate what she believes Longinus both misses and obscures: the feminine form of the sublime, which Sappho and Chopin share, one in which 'going close to death' marks 'the limits of the representable.' *
		- *'Both Sappho and Chopin offer ecstatic moments from which it is impossible to extract any one authentic meaning, refusing 'to satisfy the wish for a single or definitive interpretation' and, in doing so, constructing a sublime that cannot be contained in Longinus's conception of the sublime as a unified whole.'*
		- *'Longinus cites only one female poet in his influential Peri Hypsous (On the Sublime), the first-century treatise whose fame was revived by Boileau's French translation and commentary of 1674.'*
		- *'The poet, of course, is Sappho of Lesbos (early sixth century B.C.), and Longinus chooses her lyric phainetai moi to illustrate his view that literary excellence depends upon the writer's ability to harmonize differences and create an organic whole.'*
		- *'First and foremost, the sublime is a certain kind of linguistic event, a mode of discourse that breaks down the differences and involves a merger between speaker (or writer) and hearer (or reader).'*
		- *'Sublimity,' according to Longinus, 'is a kind of eminence or excellence of discourse.'*
		- *'It is not an essential property of language but rather makes itself known by the effect it produces, and the effect is one of ravishment; as Russel puts it, 'whatever knocks the reader out is sublime.'*
		- *'Sublime language disrupts everyday consciousness: 'great writing...takes the reader out of himself'*
		- *'The sublime utterance, which itself attempts to represent excess, also involves its production: it is accompanied by a threefold identification between speaker, message, and listener in which the latter comes 'to believe he has created what he has only heard.'*
		- *'This identification displaces the identity of its participants and is characteristic of the moment of hypsous, the state of transport and exaltation that for Longinus is the mark of sublimity.'*
		- *'One of the defining features of sublime discourse is its ability to blur customary differences between speaker and hearer, text and reader.'*
		- *'As Suzanne Guerlac points out, 'this paradoxical moment is presented by the text as being both the effect and origin of the sublime, which endangers itself through 'impregnating' the soul of the listener.'*
		- *'Unlike the listener's experience of discourse that seeks merely to please or persuade, the effect of sublime language entails a certain loss of control.'*
		- *'Longinus emphasizes that the sublime 'produces ecstasy rather than persuasion in the hearer' and insists that this 'combination of wonder and astonishment always proves superior to the merely persuasive and pleasant. This is because persuasion is on the whole something we can control, whereas amazement and wonder exert invincible power and force and get the better of every hearer.'*
		- *'The discourse of the sublime, then, is integrally bound up with the subject's responses to what possesses it, to the nature and effects of such a merger, and to the ways in which various forms of identification may be understood. At stake is the question of how to theorize ravishment.'*
		- *'For Longinus, who believes that 'sublimity will be achieved if we consistently select the most important of those inherent features and learn to organize them as a unity by combining one with another.'*
		- *'The ability 'to select and organize material' is one of the factors that 'can make our writings sublime.'*
		- *'...Homer's talent for portraying storms, he especially praises the latter's skill in depicting 'those most terrifying aspects.'*
		- *'Words at their most sublime have the force and feel of water.'*
		- *'Throughout the history of the sublime the sea has often served as its most appropriate, if not exemplary, metaphor; and it is worth recalling some traditional representations of this relation the better to understand just how dramatically Chopin's construction of the oceanic sublime differs from them.'*
		- *' How to say something that cannot be said, that confronts us with the inability to present it? The problem that has occasioned the discourse and theory of the sublime is the same as that posed by The Awakening: the difficulty of symbolizing an excess that resists visual or linguistic formulation but is there nonetheless.'*
		  *'Edna's experience of what Hertz would call 'blockage' ---her inability to translate sense-impressions into images-calls for a radically different mode of perception, but one that does not lead to an enhanced sense of self.'*
	- ### Duino Elegies by Rainer Maria Rilke - *Stimmen, Stimmen: THe Chorus of the Sublime in Rilke's Duino Elegies*
		- *'The poetic question serving as the proposition of an internal debate is a mode that dominates the twentieth century.'*
		- *'The Duino ELegies's contact with the sublime occurs most dramatically in the opening lines, and through sublimity in theme and language reappears, those occasions are clearly echoes of this, like some imperial music that was once heard up close receding and receding until it is all but inaudible.'*
		- *'We had been given the elements of sublime celebration from the start. The traditional sublime moment--one thinks of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner blessing the water snake unawares--is the moment when our gaze leaves ourselves and settles on the other.'*
	- ### Emma by Jane Austen - *Hurrying into the Shrubbery: The Sublime, Transcendence, and the Garden Scene in Emma by David C. MacWilliams*
		- *'While David C. MacWilliams observes the way Jane Austen 'responded to the cult of the sublime with humor and irony,' MacWilliams argues 'that Austen did not always disparage the cult of the sublime, and in fact, could use it seriously and positively in narrating the sense of joy her protagonists experience in cinematic scenes.'*
		- *'While Austen always enjoyed poking fun at 'the cult of the sublime,' she 'has written a sublime passage of a thoroughly sublime event.'*
		- *'In her narration of the garden scene, Austen uses five conventions of the sublime aesthetic that were widely associated with the notion in her day. Two of them are conditions that must be met before the sublime can be experienced:'*
			- *'The individuals must be morally good, and the location of the event must be out of doors.'*
			- *'The event itself progresses in three stages.'*
				- *'First, there is the fear or anxiety which precedes the transcendence;
				- *'Next, there is the sudden, unexpected striking of the sublime sensation;'*
				- *'Finally, the individuals experience a transformation, if even momentarily, from common emotions to a sense of magnificence'*
		- *'This point is the third stage of the sublime event, the transcendence. A full understanding, a kind of ecstasy, strikes the individual.'*
		- *'Yet as the scene winds down and each character reviews what has occurred--the fear, astonishment, and possibilities--we read of the transcendence which has taken place in terms of very unusual in discussions of the sublime.'*
		- *'Austen always enjoyed poking fun at Blair's rhetoric and the cult of the sublime, but, with 'strength, with conciseness, and simplicity,' she has written a sublime passage of a thoroughly sublime event.'*
	- ### The Fall of the House of Usher by Edgar Allan Poe - *The Sublime in Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher by Blake Hobby*
		- *'Edgar Allan Poe's short story 'The Fall of the House of Usher' has been seen, for the most part, as a classic horror story, a diversion that quells the sort of boredom (ennui) that we associate with ninetieth-century readers.'*
		- *'Voller contends that Gothic writers like Poe drew upon an established tradition while veering from the 'conventional sublime' to the 'radical supernatural sublime' finding absence instead of the sort of vision of plentitude we might associate with Romantic poets like Coleridge.'*
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  *'The conventional sublime creates, out of the failure that occurs in these moments of arrest and expansion, a sense of transcendent achievement and metaphysical platitude. The project of the radical supernatural sublime is to seize the moment, foreground it, and by close scrutiny reveal it to be a moment of absence, a revelation enabled by the supernatural sublime's inversion of the traditional understanding of infinity as evidence of an omnipotent divine present. In is radical mode, Gothic fiction unmasks the dissimulation of transcendence, and the gesture of unmasking, that recognition of helplessness and unfulfillment as such is the revelation of the decaying corpse in the place of God.'* 
		                                                                                                         - Jack G. Voller
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- *'As a tale that exemplifies the dark side of our sublime existence, 'The Fall of the House of Usher' places the reader and narrator in close proximity, both witness to the splendor and horror that lie in a condition without cure, life, which, no matter what experience edifies it, is ultimately overshadowed by the awe-filled and terrifying specter of death.'*
		- *'As a form of the sublime that subverts expectations for sublimity, Poe's sublime is deeply ironic, an experience of anticipation never fulfilled, a powerful grotesque tale that borders on the unbelievable. As something that negates its forms, Poe's aesthetic contains the sort of extreme irony Philip Shaw equates with the sublime:
			- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
			  *'In a very real sense, the sublime does not indeed verge on the ridiculous; it encourages us to believe that we can scale the highest mountains, reach the stars and become infinite when all the time it is drawing us closer to our actual material limits: the desire to outstrip earthly bonds leads instead to the encounter with the lack, an encounter that is painful, cruel, and some would say comic. The sublime, somewhat ironically, given its overtly metaphysical ambitions, turns out to be a form of materialism after all. Perhaps the sublime is irony at its purest and most effective: a promise of transcendence leading to the edge of an abyss.'* 
			                                                                                                     - Philip Shaw
			  #+END_QUOTE
		- *'Such an ironic conception of the sublime is helpful when considering Poe, especially in a later grotesquerie called 'The Premature Burial'*
		- *'Led step by step into a Gothic manse where a premature burial takes place, we confront primal fears. Regardless of how we try to distance ourselves, reading this story means delving into the self, that strange region we cannot touch but whose awe, terror, and emptiness we know.'*
	- ### The Four Zoas by William Blake - *Urizen and the Fragmentary Experience of the Sublime in the Four Zoas by Blake Hobby*
		- *'For Blake's Tyger, meaning making remains a burning desire within the forest of language, whether the forest be a forest of symbols, myths, religious images, theology,  or philosophy.'*
		- *'Ultimately the poem's only challenge, and the self-reflexive anxiety under which Blake suffers in the construction of the poem, is that 'The Tyger,' and by implication all poetry, should not mean but be, quoting the end of Archibald MacLeish's 'Ars Poetica.'
		- *'To create a thing that should not mean but be necessitates that the poet enter the labyrinthine maze of language and meaning-making, which creates great anxiety. Yet paradoxically, the anxiety of doing what is philosophically impossible within a bounded language is what brings the poem into being.'*
		- *'...it is more likely that the reader, pulled between the individual and universal, the inner and the outer, the private and the public, remains at a desirable point of instability afforded by the aesthetic experience, a dizzying perspective from which all perspectives can be imagined but from which none can be authenticated--a sublime position from which the inner and outer worlds can be traversed at will.'*
		- *'For life, art, and the self are, for William Blake, sublime creations incapable of being bound by the fetters of reason.'*
	- ### Frankenstein by Mary Shelley - *Frankenstein: Creation as Catastrophe by Paul Sherwin*
		- *'In Creation as Catastrophe, Paul Sherwin takes a psychoanalytic approach to Shelley's novel, which the Creature arising from a kind of primal-scene trauma and seeking wholeness.'*
		- *'In his relentless pursuit of an impossible desire, the Creature resembles a sublime artwork, one that simultaneously represents and eclipses its creator.'*
		- *'Thus, for Sherwin, the uncanny experience of bringing things back to life-whether they be the repressed trauma of the analysand or the reanimation of the Creature, mirrors the genesis of any sublime artwork.'*
		- *'Any representation of the creative process, whether the novel's narrative or my analytic account, is bound to distort the experience of the whole self. Suspended between heaven and hell, those absolutely disjoined fictive polarities that are in fact mutually sustaining correlates, the creator at once ravaged and ravaged by sublimity.'*
		- *'He is filled and swallowed up, but not entirely full or emptied out; for to be wholly abandoned to the sublime would amount to autism, and there would no longer be a self to experience the uplift or downfall.'*
		- *'It is always, to modify Emerson slightly, a case of I and the abyss.'*
		- *'Since he cannot be the thing itself and cannot be nothing, Frankenstein is a spirit destined to 'exult in the agony of the torturing flames.'*
		- *'Another name for this giant agony is despair. 'Despair,' writes Kierkegaard, cannot...'*

Yet despair is precisely self-consuming, but it is an impotent self-consumption...This is the hot incitement, or the cold fire in despair, the gnawing canker whose movement is constantly inward, deeper and deeper...This precisely is the reason he despairs...because he cannot consume himself, cannot get rid of himself cannot become nothing. This is the potentiated formula for despair, the rising of the fever in the sickness of the self.'*

	- ### God's Grandeur by Gerard Manley Hopkins - *Elements of the Longinian Sublime in the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins*
		- *'Longinus associates sublimity with such effects as elevation, grandeur, power, ecstasy, and the ability to provoke irresistible awe.'*
		- *'Sublimity,' he says 'flashing forth at the right moment scatters everything before it like a thunderbolt, and at once displays the power of the orator in all its plentitude.'*
		- *'In this way, sublime writing convinces us of the power of the writer while also enhancing the reader's own sense of power and loftiness.'*
		- *'The effect of the sublime is to 'dispose the soul to high thoughts' and to 'leave the mind more food for reflexion than the words seem to convey.'*
		- *'The poet thus manages to sound authoritative without sounding egotistical. He manages to sound ecstatic without sounding self-important or self-absorbed.'*
		- *'In his treatise, Longinus makes it abundantly clear that the sublime is not merely a matter of rhetoric and phrasing but a matter of character and morals. A bad man cannot be a sublime poet, and a corrupt, materialistic society is unlikely to produce sublime literature.'*
		- *'The sublime is a call to personal, social, and spiritual greatness, not simply to elevated but empty rhetoric, and any sublime work of literature is implicitly a critique of lowly, the trivial, and the unworthy.'*
		- *'...the proper time for using metaphors is when the passions roll like a torrent and sweep a multitude of them down their resistless flood.'*
	- ### The Poetry of Homer and Sappho - *Selection from Longinus's On the Sublime*
		- *'After the Greek text (attributed to Longinus) was translated into French and introduced to a wide readership in the seventeenth century, poets and critics alike began to form sentiments, works of art, and aesthetic theories that lauded and attempted to capture the sublime'*
		- *'For Longinus, successful writing and speaking do not merely persuade but transport their readers and listeners into a recognition of their creator's greatness, an ecstatic state where the boundary between self and other is overcome by powerful emotion.'*
		- *'There are, it may be said, five principal sources of elevated language.'*
		- *'Beneath these five varieties there lies, as though it were a common foundation, the gift of discourse which is indispensable.'*
			- *'First and most important is the power of forming great conceptions, as we have elsewhere explained in our remarks on Xenophon.'*
			- *'Secondly, there is vehement and inspired passion.'*
		- *'These two components of the sublime are for the most part innate.'*
		- *'Those which remain are partly the product of art.'*
		- *'The due formation of figures deals with two sorts of figures:*
			- *'first those of thought and secondly those of expression.'*
		- *'Next there is noble diction, which in turn comprises choice of words, and use of metaphors, and elaboration of language.'*
		- *'The fifth cause of elevation-one which is the fitting conclusion of all that have preceded it-is dignified and elevated composition.'*
		- *'Sublimity is the echo of a great soul. Hence also a bare idea, by itself and without a spoken word, sometimes excites admiration just because of the greatness of soul implied.'*
		- *'One source of the sublime in the systematic selection of the most important elements, and the power of forming, by their mutual combination, what may be called one body.'*
		- *'The former process attracts the hearer by the choice of the ideas, later by the aggregation of the chosen.'*
	- ### The Poetry of John Keats - *The Tragic Sublime of Hazlitt and Keats by W.P. Albrect*
		- *'W.P. Albrect delineates John Keats's conception and use of the Romantic sublime by first pointing out how Keats diverges from his contemporaries. Albrect argues that Keats's sublime is similar to that of William Hazlitt.'*
		- *'Albrecht provides a valuable and clear analysis of Romantic sublimity by tracing its similarities with the influential aesthetic theory of German philosopher Immanuel Kant and addressing important psychoanalytical studies of the subject by Thomas Weiskel and Stuart Ende.'*
		- *'According to Albrect, Keats rejected many notions commonly held about the sublime: that it is essentially distinct from experiencing beauty, that it is exclusively occasioned by feelings of terror and awe, and that it can only be found in the solitary and meditative contemplation of natural grandeur.'*
		- *Weiskel's model is Kant. Aesthetic form, according to Kant, must impress the judgement as purposefully disinterested. Thus, judgement links understanding with the transcendental faculty of reason.'*
		- *'Beauty engages reason when the mind bases its judgement on the interplay of visible forms. Therefore the imagination must succeed in representing these forms to the understanding.'*
		- *'Sublimity, on the other hand, requires the imagination to fail. Before the mind can call on reason for an intuition of absolute magnitude or power, it must reject, as futile, the imagination's effort to represent these qualities.'*
		- *'Therefore only by 'subreption'--that is, only by an acknowledged misrepresentation-can a sensible object be allowed to symbolize infinite oneness.'*
		- *'In order to sustain the sublime moment, the interplay of mind and object must continue to put down the sensory imagination.'*
		- *'The 'displeasure'(Unlust) in the imagination's failure and the 'pleasure'(Lust) in reason's triumph alternately repel and attract the mind.'*
		- *'Weiskel builds a similar embarrassment into the structure of the Romantic sublime.'*
		- *'In Wordsworth, however, it is not the imagination's failure to grasp the external object, but the object's failure to represent the mind's ideas, that Weiskel sees as provoking a cognitive crisis. Consequently, sensory particulars must lose their reality in a fog of self-projection.'*
		- *'In other words, the Romantic sublime can't win. It either sacrifices empirical reality to the noumenal reason, as in Kant, or smothers it with 'overdetermination' as in Wadsworth.'*
		- *'To furnish a model for the Romantic sublime, Coleridge will serve better than Kant (although Kant supplied Coleridge with some useful parts). Since an object cannot simultaneously keep and lose its 'shape,' says Coleridge, it cannot be both 'sublime and beautiful at the same moment to the same mind'; but a beautiful object, such as a circle becomes sublime when Coleridge 'contemplates eternity under that figure.'*
		- *'This is the dialectic both beauty and sublimity. Both draw on reason to inform sensory objects with some principle beyond time and space. But whereas a beautiful object does this by displaying separate parts unified within a determinate whole, the sublime dismisses all thought confined by space or time.'*
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  *'Sublimity is a quality, bestowed by the mind, which extends the reality of external objects by repudiating the boundaries of time and space in an intuition of endless power or magnitude; this intuition acquires content from the interaction of mind and object as the mind, though the synthesizing power of the imagination, tries to comprehend the infinite through an awareness of the finite.'* 
		                                                                                                     - E.H. Coleridge
		  
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- *'This definition, which applies to the psychological structure of the sublime, allows room for considerable variety of content.'*
		- *'Now it is 'human and dramatic imagination,' with all its variety and intensity, that accounts for sublimity. Hazlitt's distinction between the ideal and the dramatic describes qualities that set his sublime apart from Kant's, Coleridge's, and Wandsworth's.'*
		- *'The 'ideal' aspires 'after pure enjoyment and lofty contemplation alone...' In its 'continued approximation to the great and the good,' the mind 'rejects as much as possible not only the petty, the mean, and disagreeable, but also the agony and violence of passion, the force of contrast, and the extravagance of imagination.'*
		- *'The 'dramatic,' on the other hand, may include all of these and must include the last three.'*
		- *'It is this intensity in diversity that, according to Hazlitt, unites the tragic and the sublime.'*
		- *'Structurally, however, the tragic sublime is still within the definition generalized from Coleridge: in an intuition of endless power or magnitude the temporal and spatial separateness of sensory forms disappears from thought.'*
		- *'But in the interaction of mind and object Hazlitt has replaced 'reason' with 'reasoning imagination'--that is, with imagination so conditioned by sympathetic experience that it immediately combines selected particulars into 'truth' and 'reality.'*
		- *'Since accumulated experience recognizes the persistent reality of evil as well as good, the 'endless allness' intuited by the tragic sublime no longer has beneficent auspices or entirely reassuring effects.'*
		- *'Hazlitt's final...statement in this essay, where he argues that tragedy releases a comforting flood of benevolence and simultaneously elevates the audience to a strengthened 'desire of good.'
		- *'But in the second phrase, 'reflections' suggest a tragic 'pleasure' that is both intellectually fuller and more original. As it 'rouses the whole man within us.'*
		- *'Tragedy brings the discriminating and organizing force of thought and feeling to bear on evil, and in the mind's power to know evil--both its strength and its limits--the audience finds reassurance.'*
		- *'...tragic passion overcomes 'separateness'--in images, association, character, or action-to produce an intuition of absolute oneness.'*
		- *'Thus Hazlitt's tragic sublime conforms to the structure of the Romantic sublime. Its content, although excluding any supernatural interest in the matter, affirms the truth of intense experience as transcending evil and thereby offering reassurance in a tragic world.'*
		- *'A tragic character...may contribute to this reassurance through some sort of moral triumph over death, but moral triumph on the part of a character is not necessary to the tragic sublime.'*
		- *'All that is necessary is that the mind---of the reader or spectator---simultaneously create, test, and accept a version of the truth so firm that, in Keat's words, it is also beautiful. Thus tragedy defamiliarizes familiar pain.'*
		- *'It may help clarify the tragic sublime to mention Richard Payne Knight and Shelly.'*
		- *'Tragedy is sublime, said Knight, but neither tragedy nor any other work of art has much to do with morality. Knight did not recognize a faculty like Hazlitt's reasoning imagination which can comprehend large designs of thought and feeling.'*
		- *'What an audience enjoys is only the vigor and energy of tragic emotions. Knight's amoral sublime leaves the tragic disagreeables outside the theatre; the tragic sublime always puts them on stage.'*
		- *'Shelley's sublime is neither amoral nor always tragic. Sublimity, in Shelley's most general sense, seems to mean loftiness in beauty and virtue.'*
		- *'The imagination has brought all the mind's resources of thought and feeling into a cognitive surge that raises sensory perception to 'essential Beauty.'*
		- *'Keat does not separate the sublime from the beautiful except as 'sublime' may mean the intensity of emotion necessary to beauty.'*
		- *'Stuart A. Ende sees the sublime as an illusion-not 'morally sinister' as Weiskel calls it, but aesthetically perverse.'*
		- *'In Keats and in Yeats,' says Ende, the sometimes indistinguishable ideals' of 'Eternal Being, beauty, and one's idea of the great men who have gone before constitute poetic sublimity, the state of being to which poetic ecstasy may transport the poet.'*
		- *'Keat's professed 'humility' towards these three ideals need not, however, confirm his acceptance either of this definition or of the kind of 'otherness' it implies. This 'otherness,' Ende believes, is beyond the human exigencies of both pleasure and pain.'*
		- *'Therefore, to avoid the insubstantiality and isolation of merely contemplative poetry, a poet must settle for something less than sublimity.'*
		- *'According to Ende, Keats reached his ultimate solution in the 'sublime pathetic,' which, without completely sacrificing the search for others, retains a 'commitment to sorrow.'*
		- *'For Keats, the sublime cannot exist apart from empirical reality. It simply heightens this reality into essential beauty, regardless of any unpleasant materials reality may include.'*
		- *'The tragic sublime welcomes the disagreeables so that it may evaporate them.'*
		- *'To look for vision beyond pain, Keats discovered, is to end up loving death; but to embrace even pain in vision, is to find sublimity in life.'*
		- *'Although the tragic sublime may make moral judgements, it comprises, in its particular kind of infinite oneness, the moral extremes that make up the world's uneasy balance of good and evil'*
		- *'So defined, the tragic sublime has much the same content as Ende's 'sublime pathetic.'*
		- *'The difference, other than in language, is that the tragic sublime draws its exciting emotions from a wide range of experience, while the 'sublime pathetic' takes its initial impulse from an ideal beyond general experience-an ideal which it must eventually compromise.'*

	- ### King Lear by Youknowwho - *Othello; MacBeth; Lear by Edward Dowden*
		- *'Edward Dowden characterizes King Lear as a tragedy in which 'everything is in motion, and the motion is that of a tempest.'*
		- *'The moral ambiguity of the play's cosmos constitutes, for Dowden, a kind of verisimilitude where 'the mysteries of human life' are rendered both sublime and grotesque.'*
		- *'Remarking on Cordelia's undeserved fate and Lear's harsh punishment, Dowden asserts that Shakespeare 'does not attempt to answer these questions because the heart is purified not by dogma, but by pity and terror.'*
		- *'Thus Dowden concludes that Shakespeare presents readers and audiences of King Lear with a Stoic universe, one where 'human existence is a vast piece of unreason and grotesqueness' that can only be mitigated by an indifferent 'devotion to the moral ideal, the law of the soul, which is forever one with itself and with the highest reason.'*
		- *'By authoring a universe filled with 'inexplicable riddles' and capturing our capacity for evil-doing and loving devotion in his characterizations, Shakespeare, according to Dowden, has created a sublime drama whose 'effect cannot be received at second-hand; it cannot be described; it can hardly be suggested.'*
	- #### Kubla Kahn by Samuel Taylor Coleridge - *The Sublime in Coleridge's Kubla Khan by Robert C. Evans
		- *'Coleridge often associated the sublime with astonishingly awe-inspiring natural features-the same sorts of features that appear later in his famous poem.'*
		- *'Coleridge and the Sublimity of Landscape' are frequently reminiscent of the kind of sublime landscapes and natural features depicted in 'Kubla Khan.'*
		- *'Coleridge describes the poet as 'one who carries the simplicity of childhood into the powers of manhood; who, with a soul unsubdued by habit, unshackled by custom, contemplates all things with the freshness and wonder of a child,' particularly with 'the childlike feeling of devout wonder.'*
		- *'David Vallins begins his book by asserting that 'no other British Romantic focuses so consistently as Coleridge on the importance of transcending the material, the everyday, or the mundanely comprehensible in favor of a confrontation with the infinite forces which, like many of his contemporaries, he sees an underlying both human consciousness and the natural world.'*
		- *'Vallins associates Coleridge's views of the sublime with feelings of 'elevation and excitement' and also with ' a liberating sense of calmness and freedom from merely temporal concerns'*
		- *'For Coleridge as much as for any Romantic, the feeling of the sublime is the feeling of life itself, intuited through the medium of our own mental activity and striving.'*
		- *'In responding to sublime landscapes, Coleridge often emphasizes the 'grandeur, remoteness, wildness, and savagery of mountain regions.'*
		- *'Most readers, however, will also feel an enormous sense of gratitude to a poet capable of writing in such an intensely sublime fashion and capable of communicating, so convincingly, that sense of the sublime to others.'*
	- ### Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey by William Wordsworth - *A Poem About Interiors by Albert O. Wlecke*
		- *'For Albert Wlecke, the Wordsworthian sublime deals with the interior world: 'We might say, therefore, that whatever else 'sublime' awareness, or 'sublime' intentionality, is in 'Tintern Abbey,' it seems to involve an act in which consciousness senses itself penetrating an interior.'*
		- *'Wlecke calls the Wordsworthian sublime a sort of sacred horror in which individual autonomy and notions of self dissolve in a visionary moment: 'To be haunted by a passion is to be haunted by his love, his desire to encounter the visionary underworld of creative power. And he is simultaneously afraid of this love, of staring to directly into the awe-engendering underworld of consciousness--an underworld from which, however, he cannot quite turn his face away in the patent 'deep and gloomy wood' of Tintern Abbey.'*
		- *'Thus, for Wlecke, Wordsworth, in depicting the grandeur of nature, explores the sublime depths of consciousness imagining itself.'*
		- *'Tintern Abbey is a poem preoccupied with the insides of things, with a sense of immanent power lurking beneath the surface of phenomena. The 'something of course is 'deeply interfused' and dwells within all things.'*
		- *'Wordsworth's otherworld is thus an underworld, not that created by Miltonic vision but that discovered by consciousness turning inward upon itself. The negative comparisons of these lines curiously suggest that this underworld, while totally devoid of form or shape, is still a space, a 'haunt,' an almost sacred spot filled with the presence of awesome power.'*
		- *'Since in terms of Wordsworth's metaphors, there is nothing to be seen in this haunt--no palpable shape upon which the mind can establish a purchase--reflexive consciousness discovers no limiting contours to its introspective plunge and thus funds itself upon a fearful journey into an open-ended abyss.'*
		- *'This kind of interior space is quite different from the confining space of Locke's camera obscura. This earlier metaphor for the mind reflects both Locke's rejection of the theory of innate ideas...and his restriction of the sources of knowledge to the not always certain reports of the senses.'*
		- *'Wordsworth's metaphor of the mental abyss, however, intimates a theory of the mind which goes far beyond Locke's careful empiricism. For immanent throughout the poet's interior space is the numinous power of the imagination-sometimes referred to him by a mist or a vapor, sometimes a stream, sometimes as nothing more than the sound made by an unseen stream.'*
		- *'Consciousness allows itself to become aware aware of imagination's power by displacing that power into a shrine in the phenomena supplied by the light of sense.'*
	- ### The Poetry of Robert Lowell - *Robert Lowell, Emerson, and the American Sublime by Henry Hart*
		- *'Henry Hart examines how Lowell was both influenced and repelled by Boston's 'familiar hometown ghost,' Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the tradition of sublime poetry.'*
		- *'Though influenced by his close associations with modernist and neoclassicist writers who were openly hostile to Emerson's naivete and the 'ravenous free-enterprise capitalism' it allegedly allowed, 'Hart argues that Lowell's 'ambivalence toward Emerson jibed with his ambivalence toward himself, America, and the sublime.'*
		- *'Detailing Lowell's request critiques of America's quest for dominance over the natural and political world--and the Ahab-like attitude to the sublime that undergirds it--Hart concludes that Lowell and Emerson 'hold central positions in American literature partly because of their enchantments with a particularly American sublime.'*
		- *'Lowell fired the hackneyed salvo: Emerson was so caught up in transcendental illusions that he was blind to their nefarious consequences in the real world.'*
		- *'If Emerson's celebration of sentiment, solitude, self-reliance, and a personal Over-soul amounted to yet another romantic regression to the egotistical sublime, for Lowell and his cohorts it also amounted to another endorsement or at least an encouragement of ravenous free-enterprise capitalism and all sorts of other modern ills.'*
		- *'As T.E. Hulme, one spokesman for the antiromantic modernist charge, put it: 'Man is an extraordinary fixed and limited animal whose nature is absolutely constant. It is only by tradition and organization that anything decent can be got out of him.' In his New Critical phase, Lowell agreed.'*
		- *'Those southern and British mentors who guided the young Lowell's thought revered tradition while Emerson often blithely dismissed it. To them Emerson was too democratic, too radical, too Protestant, too American.'*
		- *'Like theorists of the sublime from Longinus to Burke and Kant, both Emerson and Lowell describe enthusiasm (from entheos, the god within) as a highly charged but also dangerous form of sublimity.'*
		- *'Both realize its potential for personal and mass hysteria, and value a religion based on reason rather than on unbridled emotion. Still, they find a place for enthusiasm in their worldviews.'*
		- *'As Lowell's biographer Ian Hamilton points out, 'enthusiasm' is a word he regularly uses to describe his manic episodes.'*
		- *'In Emerson, Lowell found a Kantian enthusiast disguised as a rationalist, a homespun philosopher who because of his cool, well-mannered temperament could endorse sublimity and even flirt with fanaticism while still remaining sober and sane.'*
		- *'But to Lowells overheated psyche, Emerson's sublimity and enthusiasm, as Winters insisted, was always potentially pathological.'*
		- *'It took Lowell a long time to recognize the complexity of Emerson's attitudes toward America, religious enthusiasm, and sublime idealism, and to realize that Emerson's ambivalence reflected his own.'*
		- *'In his essay "Sublime Politics,' Pease reveals the social impact of this transcendental repression of nature and culture in American history and offers a critique of Emersonian self-reliance that is surprisingly close to Lowell's and his neoclassic cohorts.'*
		- *'Pease argues that "Emerson does not condone or corroborate these ideological uses of the sublime.'*
		- *'According to Pease, Emerson's belief that the soul should fly beyond nature and enjoy a sublime sense of transcendence got mistranslated into a doctrine of human superiority over nature, a repudiation of nature, and was finally turned to ecological plunder for industrial gain.'*
		- *'Western expansionism and the simultaneous destruction of indigenous cultures and their natural habitats were the unintended political consequences of Emerson's high-flown ideals.'*
		- *'As if to clear a space in the wilderness for the Over-soul or bulldoze the American continent into Emerson's primordial abyss, self-reliant entrepreneurs cut and plowed and mined and built until nature withered.'*
		- *'Sublimating American resources into capitalist gold, they left a wasteland in their wake, a grotesque parody of Emerson's mystical bare ground.'*
		- *'He [Lowell] knows that America's addiction to grandeur and novelty, like his own self-aggrandizing tendencies, is ultimately destructive.'*
		- *'Their [Emerson and Lowell] contradictory responses to the sublime parallel a contradiction in America's revolutionary past, arising, as Pease has remarked, 'when citizens base their personal identity as well as their nation's identity on a refusal to acknowledge the authority of institutions inherited from the nation's past' even when realizing that 'without a past to inform their present lives, individuals have no basis for present identity.'*
		- *'Such a crisis, as Eliot pointed out long ago in 'Tradition and the Individual Talent,' confronts all artists who want to be original.'*
		- *'Absorbing tradition in order to overhaul it, they appear to reject their precursors while actually incorporating and extending them.'*
	- ### Moby-Dick by Herman Melville - *The Inscrutable Sublime and the Whiteness of Moby-Dick*
		- *'Moby-Dick-by virtue of its breadth, excess, and explicitly defined themes and conflicts--has all the trappings of an epic theodicy that stands in a long literary tradition.'*
		- *'Works of theodicy, spanning from the Bible to Dante to Milton, are concerned with explaining the ways of God to man and of defending God's goodness despite the existence of evil.'*
		- *'In relation to this genre, Moby-Dick can be characterized as a carefully orchestrated failure, a failure where the sublime--in all of its obscurity and inscrutability--is set in the place of divine revelation.'*
		- *'As Richard S. Moore asserts in his exhaustive study of sublimity in Moby-Dick, the White Whale is the 'quintessential sublime' object, a symbol of all that remains inaccessible to the human mind.'*
		- *'The stories of Ishmael and Ahab point to the failure of the very theodicy the book enshrines: By the end of the novel, the cosmic order does not seem to available to human reasoning, whether that reasoning be obsessively single-minded (Ahab's reduction of all the world's injustices--all that needs explaining--into one symbol made 'practically assailable') or expansive (Ishmael's multifaceted, negative descriptions and 'scientific anatomies).'*
		- But, as Nancy Frederick argues, two distinct plots can be discerned in the novel: Ahab's heretical quest for vengeance and Ishmael's quest to represent the whale through artistic representation.'*
		- *'Ahab's quest is predominantly framed in the grand, sweeping, theological language, equal parts egotistical defiance (in the vein of Milton's Satan and Goethe's Faust) and Job-like protestations of woe.'*
		- *'Conversely, the language of Ishmael's attempts to represent and understand the sublime-which employs multiple forms of discourse and plays with each of them-is never at ease with itself.'*
		- *'Philip Shaw offers a succinct definition that manages to encompass many disparate theories: 'Sublimity then, refers to the moment when the ability to apprehend, to know, and express a thought or sensation is defeated. Yet, through this very defeat, the mind gets a feeling for that which lies beyond thought and language.'*
		- *'Thus the importance of the sublime lies in its ability to disclose what cannot be explained rationally.'*
		- *'For many Romantic poets, most notably Coleridge, the power of sublime poetry and art to produce transcendent moments of awareness points to the central role of the poetic imagination in human life, the 'living power and prime agent of all human perception.'*
		- *'Edmund Burke's analysis of the sublime hinges upon the importance of fear. For Burke, the simultaneous apprehension of overwhelming power and terror lies at the heart of the sublime.'*
		- *'When we encounter scenes that fill us with fearful awe-that somehow imply mortal harm and inhuman scale--we are temporarily transported into a transcendent state of awareness.'*
		- *'Unlike the merely beautiful, which, according to Burke, only 'induces in us a sense of affection and tenderness', the sublime draws its emotive power from painfully disconcerting images: the immense vistas of the Pacific, the unfathomable power of Niagara Falls, and the godlike stature of the inscrutable whale all evoke sublime feelings due to their large scale (which suggests infinity), their power, and their obscurity.'*
		- *'Many have noted the central position of the sublime in Kantian philosophy, as it constitutes a link between what Kant called the phenomenal (the empirical world of sense impressions) and the noumenal (the world of undifferentiated things-in-themselves).'*
		- *'Ahab speaks of Moby Dick in a manner that suggests Kant's conception of the sublime: For Ahab, the White Whale is compared to a 'wall,' a limit that bars his inquiring mind from knowledge of the mysteries that determine lived experience.'*
		- *'Whereas Ahab strives to master the White Whale, to avenge himself against the unseen reality that hides behind and determines livid experience, Ishmael-as both mature narrator and young participant-desire understanding.'*
		- *'Though their goals are not dissimilar, and at times appear to be one and the same, Ishmael's discussion of whiteness seems to set them distinctly apart.'*
		- *'Ishmael begins his analysis of whiteness, the most 'appalling' and thus the most sublime of the monster's attributes, by making the task insurmountable: How can the 'mystical' and ineffable' be put into a 'comprehensible form?' Most of Ishmael's discussion of whiteness is a study in meaningful failure. Ishmael's discussion moves through different analytical strategies which are each, in turn, discarded.'*
		- Moby Dick's whiteness is terrifying to Ishmael for reasons he cannot fully disclose, but in his discussion of the question, what stands out in his assertion that whiteness is simultaneously the absence of any color whatsoever, as well as the aggregate of all colors.'*
		- *'Not only does Ishmael describe the meditative state, the absorption in 'sublime uneventfulness' caused by the infinite vistas of the all-encompassing ocean, but he also warns the dangers to which this gives rise.'*
		- *'Ishmael frames this description of subline exaltation in terms of identity and transcendental awareness; taking 'the mysterious ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue bottomoless soul, pervading mankind and nature.'*
		- *'Ishmael as narrator is an omniscient weaver of diverse narrative strategies and types of knowledge. These metaphors betray a different conception of the cosmos than the static and stately picture afforded us by Burke, a space where meaning occurs from the midst of flux, an obscure, indistinct and earthly sublime that does not engender transcendence, but rather a profound sense of immanence, of being in-the-world. This sublime, which Ishmael constantly defines in self-defeating, often humorous ways, suggest that the sublime itself is self defeating: What causes the sublime--our finite understanding and our awareness of death--ultimately defeats it.'*
		- *'For Ishmael, temporality, incompleteness, and mutability are what characterize the sublime and its representation in art.'*
	- ### Paradise Lost by John Milton - *Milton by Samuel Taylor Coleridge*
		- *'Samuel Taylor Coleridge is perhaps the most influential theorizer of sublimity among the British Romantic poets.'*
		- *'Coleridge singles out Milton's portrayal of Satan, with its 'singularity of daring, [its] grandeur of sufferance, [and] ruined splendor,' as a model of sublime writing. In the end, Coleridge claims that the revelation of Milton's mind 'producing itself and evolving its own greatness' is Paradise Lost's most sublime attribute.'*
		- *'There are three powers in us, which distinguish us from the beasts that perish; -1, reason; 2, the power of viewing universal truth; and 3, the power of contracting universal truth into particulars. Religion is the will in the reason, and love is the will.'*
	- ### Ode to the West Wind by Percy Bysshe Shelley - *Ode to the West Wind and Mont Blanc: Shelley and the Method of the Sublime by David Brendan Hopes*
		- *'A full definition of the word 'sublime' must encompass the simple physicality of 'lifted up' or 'above,' a material orientation as well as a metaphysical phenomenon. It is an excellent word for the operations of poetry, expressing literally 'under the lintel'--that is to say, a door, the opening of a passage from one place or state of being to another--while implying that a certain elevation of perception is required to achieve such a passage.'*
		- *'Shelley's perspective is not just more 'sublime' than Keats's; for Shelley, sublimity is the default of the perceptions. Part of his notorious obscurity and the difficulty he presents to students is that a vocabulary natural to the sublime seems elusive or obscure to those who do not dwell in sublimity.'*
		- *'Even a person whose name appears in the title of one of his poems, or to whom a poem is addressed, might feel herself rendered as a disembodied spirit, as an idea more than an individual.'*
	- ### Song of Myself by Walt Whitman - *The Sublime Self: Whitman's Sense of the Sublime in Song of Myself by David Brendan Hopes*
		- *'Sublimity is not an American quality. The sublime excludes in order to elevate. It is momentary and selective. It is very much a respecter of persons. It is a sensual connoisseurship. It is elite.'*
		- *'Yet American architecture aims at, and often achieves, the sublime, and our geography would seem to cry out for it. Somehow our poets have not desired the vocabulary, or possessed the particular will, to communicate at a similar elevation.'*
		- *'The sublime requires surrender, and the American idiom has always depended more on will--or, at the extreme, self-glorification--than on surrender.'*
	- ### The Poetry of William Butler Yeats - *Yeats: Tragic Joy and the Sublime by Jahan R. Ramazani*
		- *'In his revaluation of Yeat's poems and their place in the post-Romantic tradition of poetry, Jahan Ramazani focuses on their evocation of 'tragic joy': 'their affective movement from terror to joy (the psychological sublime) as well as their characteristically violent figures and fragmentary images (the rhetorical sublime).'
		- *'Observing the sublime's long-held association with the literary figurations of death, Ramazani asserts that the attempt to evoke sublimity is a kind of curse for Yeats and his Romantic predecessors, a self-destructive effort to 'integrate with the final form of reality.'*
		- *'In the temporal structure of the sublime, the anticipation of death gives rise to a counterasserton of life.'*
		- *'In psychological terms, the hero and the poet surmount the threat of the destructive father through identification with him.'*
		- *'This psychoanalytic model of the sublime can help us interpret the overarching affective movement of Yeat's poems of tragic joy. In brief, these poems introject the violent, paternal threat, thereby permitting the conversion of defensive and pathetic energy into joy.'*
		- *'As Longinus reminds us, the joy of the sublime is ultimately based on an illusion: 'It is our nature to be elevated by true sublimity. Filled with joy and pride, we come to believe we have created what we have only heard.'*
		- *'In Yeat's sublime poems, words and images seem to have an 'independent reality,' invading the mind from beyond it, each like an 'emblem' that 'sails into the sight.'*
		- *'Nevertheless, interpretations of the sublime that overemphasize this threat to identity of the subject risk turning the sublime into mysticism.'*

- # THE TABOO
  collapsed:: true
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665672605335_0.png)
	- ## The Taboo according to Bloom...
		- *'Incest, Shelley remarked, is the most poetical of circumstances. Patricide is a close second, and haunts Shakespearean tragedy.'*
		- *'Incest and patricide are founding taboos of Oedipal tragedy. Hamlet calls it adulterous and incestuous, and Shakespeare does not disclose the answer.'*
		- *'Hamlet, the most intelligent figure in all of literature, cannot be explained simply upon the basis of taboo, even that of father-murder. It may be that his transgressions, and his spiritual heroism, are larger.'*
		- *'Freud's weird study, Totem and Taboo, postulates a Primal History Scene in which the Totem Father is slain and devoured by his many sons, who are a horde of enemy brothers. The dead Father then becomes more revered than the living one had been.'*
		- *'Transformed into an ancestor god, he becomes a religious icon.'*
		- *'Freud repeated this pattern in his Moses and Monotheism, which outrageously says that the Hebrews killed Moses and then founded Judaism upon his martyrdom.'*
		- *'Clearly Freud amalgamated the Totem Father, Moses, and Dr. Sigmund Freud, founder of the New Judaism of his own, supposed science. That is a perpetually challenging story of taboo and its discontents.'*
	- ## The Taboo According to Literature
		- ### Confessions of an English Opium Eater by Thomas De Quincy - *Les Paradis Artificiels by Charles Baudelaire*
			- *'A champion of the urbane and modernity, Charles Baudelaire often challenged accepted norms and explored such taboos as sex and illicit drug use.'*
			- *'He depicted the dark inner landscape of the melancholic mind, and he died an opium addict, so many people view his life as debauched and tragic.'*
			- *'Interested in the recreational, spiritual, and imaginative use of drugs, Baudelaire translated Thomas De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium Eater and fashioned his own treatise on this subject, Les Paradis Artificiels.'*
			- *'In doing so, he broke a longstanding taboo, inviting us to see both the visionary benefits and isolating effects of drug use.'*
			- *'What does one experience? What does one see? Things marvelous, things extraordinary? Is this wonderful and terrible and really dangerous? Such are the ordinary questions that the ignorant address, with a curiosity mixed with conceit, to the adepts.'*
			- *'One might say a childish impatience of knowledge, such as that of those who have never left the corner of their fires, when they find themselves face to face with a man who returns from distant unknown lands. They figure to themselves the intoxication of Haschisch as if it were a prodigious prodigality, a vast theatre of prestidigitation and of jugglery, where all is miraculous and unexpected. That is a prejudice, a complete mistake.'*
			- *'Let men of the world and those who are ignorant, seriously anxious to find the secret of exceptional enjoyments, know to a certainty that they will not find in Haschisch anything miraculous, absolutely nothing but what is naturally excessive.'*
	- ### Dracula by Bram Stoker - *Suddenly Sexual Women in Bram Stoker's Dracula*
		- *'Phyllis A. Roth summarizes the various interpretations of Dracula that have been proposed to date, including those that deal with taboo fantasies such as Oedipal desire and that seek to show how the novel's fantasies are managed in such a way as to convert horror to pleasure.'*
		- *'According to Roth, 'Central to the structure and unconscious theme of Dracula is, then, primarily the desire to destroy the threatening mother, she who threatens by being desirable.' For Roth, the hostility towards female sexuality (itself a social taboo) that is 'displayed throughout the novel provides much of the appeal for Stoker's audience.'*
		- *'In other words, Dracula successfully manages a fantasy which is congruent with a fundamental fantasy shared by many others.'*
		- *'Several of the interpretations of Dracula either explicitly or implicitly indicate, that this 'core fantasy' derives from the Oedipus complex.'*
		- *'The facile and stereotypical dichotomy between the dark woman and the fair, the fallen and the idealized, is obvious in Dracula.'*
		- *'Indeed, among the more gratuitous passages in the novel are those in which the 'New Woman' who is sexually aggressive is verbally assaulted. Mina Harker remarks that such a woman, whom she holds in contempt, 'will do the proposing herself.'*
		- *'Perhaps nowhere is the dichotomy of sensual and sexless women more dramatic than it is in Dracula and nowhere is the suddenly sexual woman more violently and self-righteously persecuted than in Stoker's 'thriller.'*
		- *'The equation of vampirism with sexuality is well established in the criticism.'*
		- *'We must agree that Dracula is permeated by 'morbid dread.' However, another tone interrupts the dread of impending doom throughout the novel; that note is one of lustful anticipation, certainly anticipation of catching and destroying forever the master vampire, Count Dracula, but additionally, lustful anticipation of a consummation one can only describe as sexual.'*
		- *'One things for example, of the candle's sperm' which 'dropped in white patches' on Lucy's coffin as Van Helsing opens it for the first time.'*
		- *'Harker meets with three vampire women (whose relation to Dracula is incestuous) whose appeal is described almost pornographically:
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  *'All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips.'*
		                                                                                               - Bram Stoker, Dracula
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- *'To consider the first point, only relations with vampires are sexualized in the novel; indeed, a deliberate attempt is made to make sexuality seem unthinkable in 'normal relations' between the sexes.'*
		- *'All the close relationships, including those between Lucy and her three suitors and Mina and her husband, are spiritualized beyond credibility. Only when Lucy becomes a vampire is she allowed to be 'voluptuous,' yet she must have been so long before, judging from her effect on men and from Mina's description of her. Clearly, then, vampirism is associated not only with death, immortality and orality; it is equivalent to sexuality.'*
		- *'Moreover, in psychoanalytic terms, the vampirism is a disguise for greatly desired and equally strongly feared fantasies. These fantasies, as stated, have encouraged critics to point to the Oedipus complex at the center of the novel. Dracula, for example, is seen as the 'father-figure of huge potency.'*
		- *'The Oedipal rivalry is not, however, merely a matter of the Van Helsing group in which, as Richardson says, 'Van Helsing represents the good father figure' pitted against the Big Daddy, Dracula. Rather, from the novel's beginning, a marked rivalry among the men is evident.'*
		- *'The rivalry is defended against by the constant, almost obsessive, assertion of the value of friendship and agape among members of the Van Helsing group. Specifically, the defense of overcompensation is employed, most often by Van Helsing in his assertions of esteem for Dr. Seward and his friends. The others, too, repeat expressions of mutual affection ad nauseum; they clearly protest too much.'*
		- *'Since we now see that Dracula acts out the repressed fantasies of the others, since those others wish to do what he can do, we have no difficulty in recognizing an identification with the aggressor on the part of characters and reader alike. It is important, then, to see what it is that Dracula is after.'*
		- *'Dracula's desire is for the destruction of Lucy and Mina and what this means is obvious when we recall that his attacks on these two closest of friends seem incredibly coincidental on the narrative level. Only on a deeper level is there is no coincidence at all: the level on which one recognizes that Lucy and Mina are essentially the same figure: the mother.'*
		- *'Central to the structure and unconscious theme of Dracula is, then, primarily the desire to destroy the threatening mother, she who threatens by being desirable.'*
	- ### Howl by Allen Ginsberg - *Transgression, Release, and 'Moloch by Jeffry Gray*
		- *'The similarities between Ginsberg and Whitman do not stop there. They include the two poets' references to sexuality and the body; the exuberant tone, long lines, and catalogues; the sheer length of Song of Myself and Howl; the collapsing of binary oppositions (soul/body, man/woman, high/low, and others); and the celebration of male camaraderie, both in the homoerotic sense and-in Whitman's case-more often in a spiritualized sense as a remedy for the ills of society.'*
		- *'But as the trial transcripts reveal, it was principally four-letter words that concerned authorities. Howl's transgressions were (and are) many-sexual, social, aesthetic, religious, and political.'*
		- *'Ginsberg's declaration of ethnicity, homosexuality, drug use, and Communist sympathies in both 'Howl' and Kaddish' occurred at a time when these identities and practices were virtually unmentionable. Ginsberg's humor and self-parody helped to deflate the repressive power against which 'Howl' was especially directed.'*
		- *'The taboos Ginsberg violated with such force in Howl were those most entrenched in society:'*
			- 1 - the taboo against the unrestrained sociopathic speech of madness and irrationality
			- 2 - the taboo against sexuality outside of marriage and other moral constraints; and, chiefly,
			- 3 - the taboo against mocking and destabilizing the traditional partition between the sacred and the profane, against treating all phenomenal, high  and low, spiritual and physical, as simultaneous and on an equal plane.
		- *'Every society is structured upon a division between the sacred and the profane. Indeed, that division can be said to define a society.'*
		- *'Much of the transgressiveness of Howl can be subsumed under the heading of a particular theme, what one might call the trope of nakedness in U.S. literature-the sense of immediacy, that the reader is getting something more 'real' for being unadorned and unabashed.'*
		- *'For Whitman, stripping bare is a general metaphor for release. This is equally true of Ginsberg, with the additional dimension that Ginsberg actually stripped naked in front of audiences, breaking a taboo that Whitman, though he took considerable risks for the late nineteenth century, surely never contemplated'*
		- *'Eventually 'mainstream' culture and literature made a place for adversarial culture, as has happened so often in U.S. history.'*
	- ### Julius Caesar by Youknowwho - *Totem, Taboo, and Julius Caesar by Cynthia Marshall*
		- *'Although Freud's Totem and Taboo contains no explicit reference to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Cynthia Marshall describes the way "Freud's concept of taboo culture, the primitive banding together of brothers for the purpose of overcoming the father, recreates Shakespeare's picture of Roman society.'*
		- *'By focusing on Freud's obsession with the character of Brutus, a role Freud played as a child, and by exploring the two texts for the way they resonate off one another, Marshall connects the taboo in Freud's text, in Freud's life, and in Shakespeare's play.'*
		- *'For Marshall, 'The story of Julius Caesar-part myth, part history-exists on the cusp of civilization; the father-son conflict is partly actual and partly symbolic. Yet because Brutus is identified in action, he must fail where Freud, heir to his ambivalence, succeeds: repression of the parricidal wish enables Freud to internalize the father, in the form of taboo law or superego.'*
		- *'If some such ghost threatens Freud, he quickly wards it off: although the content of the following dream (Freud's own) does not concern fathers, its interpretation--encapsulated as, 'It is absurd to be proud of one's ancestors; it is better to be an ancestor oneself' expresses the ambivalence of struggle with the patriarchal bond.'*
		- *'Yet, as Freud writes in Totem and Taboo, 'The law only forbids men to do what their instincts incline them to do; so here the repudiation of patriarchy would be unnecessary were it easy or instinctual to disclaim pride in one's ancestors.'*
		- *'As Freud summarizes his myth in Civilization and Its Discontents, 'the human sense of guilt,' and hence the conscience, derive from an original murder, 'the killing of the primal father'. The deed is not posited as metaphoric, like the relationship that the mythic and dramatic story of Oedipus supposedly bears to modern parent-child relationships, but rather as an actual ordinary act, setting in motion the guilt of subsequent generations.'*
		- *'Whether occurring once for the species as a whole, or reputedly within numerous tribes, a first, supposedly real, parricide produces remorse in the murdering sons, who subsequently establish the super-ego, investing it with the power of the father, and thus creating the law, the 'restrictions...intended to prevent a repetition of the deed.'*
		- *'A domino effect of rebellion and guilt is set in motion, with the members of each generation passing through their roles as aggressive sons before assuming positions as repressive fathers.'*
		- *'But ultimately the relationship with the parent enters Freud's claimed domain of the symbolic: "Whether one has killed one's father or has abstained from doing so is not really the decisive thing. One is bound to feel guilty in either case, for the sense of guilt is an expression of the conflict due to ambivalence.'*
	- ### Lady Chatterley's Lover by D.H. Lawrence - *1925-30 by Frank Kermode*
		- *'Due to its sexually explicit scenes, vulgar language, and depiction of a scandalous affair between an aristocratic lady and a working class man who is her husband's gamekeeper, Lady Chatterley's Lover was banned in the United States and England and was not available legally in unabridged form until 32 years after its initial printing in Florence, Italy.'*
		- *'As Frank Kermode indicates, Lawrence intended to shock his audience with his exploration of these and other taboos.'*
		- *'However, according to Kermode, rather than merely seeking to create a shocking piece of literature, Lawrence also crafted an explicit critique of society in his novel, calling for 'cultural and economic reform.''*
		- *'For Kermode, rather than a prurient work qualifying as pornography, Lady Chatterley's Lover presents the taboo within a highly moral framework.'*
		- *'He wanted to call the book John Thomas and Lady Jane, though sometimes he preferred Tenderness. Tenderness, as he explained in a letter already quoted, was to replace leadership as the quality most necessary to the health of the world.'*
		- *'The change in consciousness which would make Lady Chatterley's Lover acceptable as 'tenderness' rather than 'obscenity' is one that the book itself desperately advocates, though at the same time taking it to be impossible without the intervention of the 'bad time' that it announces as on the way.'*
		- *'The need, as Lawrence saw it, was to avoid euphemisms which are in themselves evidence of the sell-out of the passional to the intellectual; to restore the words which belong to the old blood-consciousness. But insofar as these words were secret and sacred, they had value as ritual profanities; and so they became a part of the culture, proper to the expansive movements of constricted lives-a fact reflected in the heavy use made of them by soldiers and sailors, poor men in circumstances of sexual privation.'*
	- ### Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov - *I have only words to play with: Taboo and Tradition in Nabokov's Lolita by Samuel Schuman*
		- *'To say that Lolita focuses upon subject matter which was, and still is, strongly taboo in Western culture is, clearly, a flamboyant understatement.'*
		- *'What makes Humbert's narration problematic is that, poet or not, he is a consummate wordsmith: learned, witty, full of arguments and examples that support or justify his obsession. His words are always fascinating, even mesmerizing.'*
		- *'Nabokov and Humbert have been seen by some readers as making the case that vice is so much more interesting than virtue, that there is a kind of repellent attraction that can make evil irresistible.'*
		- *'This leads to a second, worthwhile, query: Is Vladimir Nabokov a pervert, a pedophile, a sex maniac, or what?'*
		- *'It is easy to forget that sometimes readers, particularly relatively inexperienced readers, habitually confuse the narrative voice with the authorial perspective. (*This is perhaps one reason such readers tend to refer to the author, and often the characters, of literary works as 'they' as in 'What do they mean at the end of Hamlet by calling him a 'sweet prince?')'*
		- *'The difference between the narrative mask and the authorial consciousness seems so obvious to more experienced readers that we often forget how crucial the discovery of the gap is to literary understanding. Lolita is an ideal book to teach or reinforce, that lesson.'*
		- *'Because Humbert is trying so hard, with such intellectual heavy artillery, to suggest that his thoughts and actions are not evil, it can be easily at first to imagine that his creator is making that case.'*
		- *'A careful reading of Lolita demonstrates the underlying ethical soundness of the work and its author. The novel moves increasingly away from the narrator's pathetic efforts at moral justification, and attentive readers, even if inexperienced, come to realize that Nabokov and Humbert are totally different entites.'*
		- *'Anyone who reads Lolita attentively from cover to cover is going to realize that the author does not agree with, or even much like, his main character.'*
		- *'The 'moral' or 'theme' of Lolita is to be found in its magical prose.'*
		- *'It is not possible to read Lolita with care and not recognize poor writing, one's own and that of others'*
	- ### Lord of the Flies by William Golding - *Men of a Smaller Growth: A Psychological Analysis of William Golding's Lord of the Flies by Claire Rosenfield*
		- *'Claire Rosenfield focuses on the way Golding dramatizes Freudian theory.'*
		- *'Rosenfield argues that without the structuring and repressive influence of traditional authority figures, the boys on the island are free to create a new culture, which reflects 'the genuine primitive society, evolving its gods and demons (its myths), its rituals and taboos (its social norms).'*
		- *'According to Huizinga's theory of play, war is a game, a contest for prestige which, like the games of primitives, or of classical athletes, may be fatal. It, too, has its rules, although the modern concept of total war tends to obscure both its ritualistic and ennobling character.'*
		- *'The ultimate irrationality is war. Paradoxically, the children not only return to a primitive and infantile morality, but they also degenerate into adults. They prove that, indeed, 'children are but men of smaller growth.'*
	- ### The Miller's Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer - *Social and Religious Taboos in Chaucer's The Miller's Tale by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'The broad notion of behavior (including speech) that is forbidden, condemned, prohibited, and/or proscribed by society as improper or unacceptable has probably existed in every human culture, even if precise definitions of taboo topics, objects, conduct, or forms of speech have varied widely from place to place across time.'*
		- *'Cultures define themselves, in large part, in terms of, what they prohibit, condemn, or find unacceptable, and thus the study of taboo behavior is, paradoxically, one of the best ways of comprehending a culture's deepest and most cherished standards as well as its mostly widely shared assumptions and beliefs.'*
		- *'By understanding what a culture condemns, we can understand what it values.'*
		- *'Like a photographic negative that can provide a positive image, the study of taboo thoughts, behavior, and speech can illuminate a culture's most fundamental ideals.'*
		- *'Nearly all the taboos the Miller flouts can be defined, to one degree or another, as religious taboos-rules rooted in a strong sense of what was proper, sacred, and holy,, particularly in CHristian terms.'*
		- *'The Miller's Tale is a work that brims with violations of assorted social and religious taboos, but it is also a work that inevitably reminds us of the very standards and ideals that its characters (and teller) transgress.'*
	- ### The Mother by Gwendolyn Brooks - *The Taboo in Gwendolyn Brooks' The Mother by Kate Falvey*
		- *'Gwendolyn Brooks' elegiac and hauntingly ruthless poem, 'the mother,' was controversial at the time of its conception. The poem has a rare power to ignite conflicting responses and to slyly compel readers to question and qualify a too-sure initial reading.'*
		- *'Certainly, the poem conjures the powerlessness and straitened socioeconomic conditions that compel the mother-narrator's extreme response and ultimate self-victimization.'*
		- *'Also at stake in the poem is the meaning of motherhood itself, both as an identity and identifier-with the ferocity, the losses, the self-pithy and self-justification, the guilt, and despair that comprise such a vexed, singular experience.'*
		- *'That the poem is spoken by a non-mother, one who has aborted her children out of necessity, in defiance, with tremendous ambivalence, is the central-and perhaps misleading-irony of this lyrically charged poem.'*
		- *'Abortions will not let you forget--an unnervingly confessional statement, aggressive in its shocking matter-of-factness.'*
		- *'The voice of 'the mother' resonates with the voice of all motherhood, sounding the primal chords of hope and unrelenting love even in the face of unremitting losses.'*
		- *'Yet this mother also exhibits a darker side of motherhood as she feasts on the deliciousness of her unborn children while intimating that, had they lived, she may have harmed them: 'You will never neglect or beat them...you will never leave them, controlling your luscious sigh, return for a snack of them, with gobbling mother-eye'.*
		- *'The mother in this poem is symbolic of a more insidious taboo that Brooks' poem expose and break: our societal refusal to see members of our underclasses as fully sentient, fully human, and fully credible.'*
		- *'Can a woman who has had her pregnancies terminated claim to be a mother?'*
		- *'Brooks' work supplies a hard-hitting, taboo-breaking exposure of the same issues that plague women today and remains a testament to her bravery and uncompromising poetic resolve.'*
	- ### Mourning Becomes Electra by Eugene O'Neill - *I Forgive Myself!: Escaping the Ever-Present Past in Eugene O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra by Scott Walters*
		- *'Mourning Becomes Electra should appear in a volume of essays focused on taboos in literature, for the play contains more prohibited desires and forbidden acts per page, I suspect, than just about any work of dramatic literature in the Western Canon.'*
		- *'Indeed by the time the three parts of the play have reached an end, the tally of taboos is impressive indeed: one Electra Complex, two Oedipus Complexes, one instance of near brother-sister incest, two murders, and two suicides. In fact, at the end of the play there is only a single major character left standing.'*
		- *'O'Neill's play is not about the taboos themselves, rather the sensationalist events of the plot are the outward manifestations of a toxic and extreme belief system that permeates the characters' past, present, and future.'*
		- *'It is this worldview, which O'Neill ascribes to the Puritan values of the New England patrician family of Mannon, that is the focus of O'Neill's play and the true antagonist of Mourning Becomes Electra. This worldview is characterized by an obsessive focus on sexuality and past actions, one's own and those of others.'*
		- *'Each grouping, each identical tragic couple, makes their own attempt to escape the Mannon curse, but none are successful until finally, after multiple murders, suicides, and emotional self-destruction, only one character is left to claim the final ironic victory over the past.'*
		- *'O'Neill takes us through a process of spiritual exorcism that begins in punishment, proceeds to flight, and is ended by defiant resignation.'*
		- *'It is a Pyrrhic victory, but a victory nonetheless, one that, while not restoring life and health, at least ends death and disease. The final sound of the play is the sound of the shutters slamming closed and the door shutting behind Lavinia.'*
		- *'Unlike Aeschylus' play, O'Neill's Furies are not transformed into benevolent Eumenides-that would be to easy for a modern audience to accept, and certainly too easy for the tormented O'Neill to do so-but they are confronted, and they do, at last, die. And perhaps that, for O'Neill, is the best that one can hope for.'*
	- ### Oedipus Tyrannus by Sophocles - *Chapter Nine by Friedrich Nietzsche*
		- *'German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche contemplates the many roles Oedipus fulfills in Sophocles' The Theban Plays.'*
		- *'Oedipus blindly transgresses the most powerful familial taboos-patricide and incest-and this blindness becomes his punishment.'*
		- *'But, as Nietzsche observes, Oedipus is a truth seeker, an Apollonian figure who redeems his society.'*
		- *'Thus the taboo and Oedipus' desire for knowledge constitute, for Nietzsche, a single act against nature, an 'extraordinary counter-naturalness.' 'Broken by prophetic and magical powers,' the 'spell of nature' is broken by Oedipus, and audiences are made to 'glance at the abyss.'*
		- *'It is this intuition which I see imprinted in the awful triad of the destiny of Oedipus: the very man who solves the riddle of nature-that double-constituted Sphinx-must also, as the murder of his father and husband and mother, break the holiest laws of nature.'*
		- *'The sharpness of wisdom turns round upon the sage: wisdom is a crime against nature': such a terrible expression does the myth call out to us: but the Hellenic poet touches like a sunbeam the sublime and formidable Memnonian statue of the myth, so that it suddenly begins the sound in Sophoclean melodies.'*
	- ### The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde - *Taboo in the Picture of Dorian Gray by Arundhati Sanyal*
		- *'Oscar Wilde's novella The Picture of Dorian Gray explores the relationship between an artist, Basil Hallward, and the subject he paints: a beautiful young man named Dorian Gray who is obsessed with preserving his youth.'*
		- *'Under the influence of Lord Henry Wotton, who sees life's purpose as the pursuit of beauty and sensual fulfillment, Dorian wishes that the portrait painted by Hallward will age while Dorian himself does not.'*
		- *'Ultimately, as Dorian engages in hedonistic acts, the image in the portrait ages, gradually becoming more and more disfigured, allowing Dorian to retain his unaffected youth and beauty.'*
		- *'As the novel's characters interact and as Dorian changes, a profound discussion of art and its relationship to our moral, ethical, and psychological selves ensues. From this discussion, Dorian Gray emerges as both an innocent upon whom Hallward and Wotton impose meaning and also a Faustian figure championing the taboo.'*
		- *'Dorian is both a figure representing the sacred virtues of art and also a hedonist, dedicated to gratifying his senses.  The word 'taboo' can refer both to Dorian's prohibited actions that require concealment as well as his 'sacred' pursuit of artistic beauty.'*
		- *'Dorian's portrait symbolizes the sacred and taboo experiences he shares with Basil, Henry, and Sybil.'*
		- *'The novel is primarily about the relationship between the artist, his subject, and the created work of art.'*
		- *'Dorian's pristine beauty and peculiarly 'unconscious' innocence are irresistible to both painter and philosopher. Both of his admirers are drawn to this state of 'blankness,' which makes Dorian the perfect receptor to all influence as well as profoundly vulnerable: his personality is not strong enough to counter the influence Henry will bring to bear on him.'*
		- *'The relationship Dorian develops between himself and his portrait is a direct consequence of Henry's seduction. Henry makes Dorian conscious of his beauty and insists this narcissism is essential to his understanding of the world. Thus Dorian begins to understand himself in terms of the effect his beauty has on the senses of his spectators, so much so that he is able to objectify himself when he gazes at his portrait, becoming enamored with himself.'*
		- *'Narcissus is driven mad by his dual role as lover and loved; similarly, the moment destroys Dorian's sense of wholeness. He is now able to perceive himself as two distinct selves: one who possesses immutable beauty and the other who has knowledge and soul and consequently is subject to the ravages of time. He has to live a double life.'*
		- *'Narcissus wishes to be joined with his image, while Dorian wishes only for the eternal youth that his image seems to possess.'*
		- *'Dorian experiences every form of decadent pleasure and sensation imaginable. Through his journey, the physical form Dorian projects onto the world is the one Basil had been overwhelmed by-a façade of purity, youth, and innocence-while the actual state of his soul and its incessant degeneration is reflected on the painting itself.'*
		- *'The metaphor of the painting in the novel, which merges art and life, allows Dorian to violate taboos while avoiding moral consequences. Dorian survives public censure because he remains physically perfect. He alone is able to see the moral degeneration that takes place and is reflected in the painting.'*
		- *'Like the legendary Faust, Dorian barters moral responsibility for what he most desires: pleasure through art, perfumes, exotic music, and forbidden homosexual love.'*
		- *'Basil, who has stood for the moral dimension of all artistic endeavors, choses to counter Henry by becoming a figure of conscience for Dorian. Basil promises to withhold all judgement against Dorian until he has seen his soul. It is fitting that Dorian leads Basil to his painting for this purpose of revealing his soul, the same painting that Basil himself had refused to exhibit because it would reveal too much of the artist's soul.'*
		- *'The novel reveals Dorian's degeneration to be irreversible. In his downward spiral, Dorian leaves Henry, who is unable to fathom the debauched depths to which his protégé has fallen, far behind.'*
		- *'Eventually, the portrait degenerates murderously, killing the actual Dorian as he attempts to annihilate the image of his moral corruption. Dorian dies, but the painting takes on the youthful and pristine physical characteristics again.'*
		- *'In revealing the hero's irreversible and unrelenting end, the narrative becomes an ironic reminder of the moralistic conception of the art that Oscar Wilde opposed throughout his creative life.'*
	- ### The Poetry and Prose of Sylvia Plath - *God's Lioness - Sylvia Plath, Her Prose and Poetry by Wendy Martin*
		- *'For Wendy Martin, Sylvia Plath is an often-misunderstood writer who, because she courageously explored the taboo of her own emotions, experience, hostility and despair, 'challenged the traditional literary prioritization of female experience.'*
		- *'Thus, when writing about Plath's autobiographical novel, Martin concludes The Bell Jar chronicles Esther Greenwood's rite de passage from girlhood to womanhood, and explores such subjects as sexual initiation and childbirth which are, for the most part, taboo in women's fiction.'*
		- *'By focusing on the way Plath forged unapologetic art, Martin illuminates the many ways Plath is 'a pioneer and a pathfinder.'*
		- *'Apparently, Sylvia Plath played her social role so convincingly that few guessed at the intensity of her despair, but her novel, which is largely autobiographical, illuminates the sense of isolation conveyed by her poetry.'*
		- *'Esther expects more from life than free complexion and hair care advice and would rather be in a bar than a beauty salon. But her nightclub experiences with her glamorous friend Doreen and disc jockey Lenny Shepard serve only to teach her that in order to live life outside the ladies' luncheon circuit, a woman must attract an escort in order to experience the larger world.'*
		- *'Sickened by this parasitic femininity, she resolves to get by on her own; she wants to see life for herself.'*
		- *'The 'stale and sour' climate of Esther's inner world reflects the stifling conditions of her external life: the bell jar is a symbol for the internal chaos and despair produced by excessive external prohibitions.'*
		- *'Sylvia Plath was one of the first American women writers to refuse to conceal or disguise her true emotions; in articulating her aggression, hostility, and despair in her art, she effectively challenged the traditional literary prioritization of female experience.'*
	- ### A Rose for Emily by William Faulkner - *Usher, Poquelin, and Miss Emily: the Progress of Southern Gothic*
		- *'In this study of Faulkner's short story, Edward Stone deals with the elements that make Faulkner's story distinctly taboo: 'not only does this obsessed spinster continue for some years to share a marriage bed with the body of the man she has poisoned-she evidently derives either erotic gratification or spiritual sustenance from these ghastly nuptials. She becomes, in short, a necrophile or veritable saprophytic organism.'*
		- *'By tracing conventions employed by Edgar Allen Poe, Stone articulates what makes the short story emblematic of Faulkner's gothic style, one in which the taboo is wedded with grotesque.'*
		- *'Faulkner's are stories not only of horror, but everywhere of time and place. Our imaginations are thus fixed at once in both stories an an exact setting.'*
		- *'Here, then, are two stories presenting a central conflict between a proud and doomed but indomitable last representative of an important family of a bygone era of the South and the progress of an encroaching and usurping civilization.'*
	- ### Sabbath's Theatre by Philip Roth - *The Taboo in Philip Roth's Sabbath's Theatre by Julia F. Klimek*
		- Sabbath's Theater challenges the most seasoned Roth reader with its long list of taboos broken, transgressions enacted and imagined, and its general spirit of unapologetic defiance, both in the face of society's morals and of morality itself.'*
		- *'Sabbath manipulates and corrupts others into joining him in the breaking of taboos. He is driven by a fear of death and a wish to reach beyond its finality. Sabbath is traumatized by losses he cannot accept: first the death of his older brother Morty when he is still a boy, later the disappearance and possible death of his first wife Nikki, and finally the loss of his long-term lover Drenka.'*
		- *'Sabbath commits morbid and often offensive acts in his efforts to reconnect with these people, through memories and gestures. When he does succeed, his disregard for his own dignity is oddly touching, and readers empathize with Sabbath, in spite of his transgressions.'*
		- *'Everyone around Sabbath becomes part of Sabbath's dramatic performance, and the drama teeters on the verge of insanity.'*
		- *'The sexual content in Sabbath's performance is just as integral to his mission as offensiveness, sexual or other, to Roth's: by probing the limits of his readers' tolerance for difference and explicitness he exposes taboos, offering them up for negotiation and discussion-or just pleasure: as Shechter delights, 'The defiance simply is!'*
	- ### The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie - *Breaking Totems and Taboos: Rushdie's The Satanic Verses by Rossitsa Artemis*
		- *'Having lived under the threat of execution for many years, Rushdie has been made painfully aware not simply of the reception his works receive, but also of the vulnerability of the modern man in a world still governed by religious and political fundamentalism and prejudice.'*
		- *'Despite the enormous variety of his settings and plot lines, the common motif in all these literary works is Rushdie's questioning of reality, a preoccupation of what has been christened 'postmodern' literature.'*
		- *'His fantastic representations make a rather disconcerting point about modernity in all its aspects: social, religious, cultural, and political.'*
		- *'Both Rushdie and his characters are often controversial in their downright rejection of the permanency and stability our common beliefs about life and fiction require.'*
		- *'The Satanic Verses is a novel that celebrates the controversies that made Rushdie famous so early in his career: irreverence for the Muslim religion and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's racist politics.'*
		- *'The uncertainties that he values so highly are brought here to their most conspicuous state: an utmost disbelief in the grand narratives of religion and the questionable politics of Western--and Eastern---society, seen through the prism of what cultural theorist Jean-Francois Lyotard calls 'the postmodern condition.'*
		- *'It is understandable that the novel, with its emphasis on the 'mongrelization' of grand narratives, upset many cultural conservatives and religious fundamentalists who felt their way of life was under attack. The Satanic Verses is transgressive on many levels: language and imagery in the novel work together to break sacred taboos of Islamic mullahs, as well as some conservative Westerners, even Rushdie's most obvious novelistic transgressions are unpardonable.'*
		- *'From a post-colonial perspective, Rushdie rejects the claim of the West to be a metropolitan center, a righteous illuminator of backward nations and savior of indigenous cultures. The political demagogy of the West is a form of fundamentalism, one just as dangerous as religious fundamentalism.'*
		- *'The Satanic Verses implodes such doctrines, addressing the anxiety of living in a world that incessantly outgrows the wildest fictional reality.'*
	- ### The Poetry of Anne Sexton - *The Poetic Heroism of Anne Sexton by Diana Hume George*
		- *'In her essay 'The Poetic Heroism of Anne Sexton' critic Diana Hume George examines the taboo subject matter that appears throughout Sexton's poetry and its resonance with the Oedipus myth, as interpreted by Sigmund Freud and Brun Bettelheim.'*
		- *'For George, Sexton's attempts to confront her childhood neuroses recall Oedipus' search for truth. Sexton 'thought herself guilty of her mother's death, and of marrying her father,' and struggles to resolve her feelings through poetic disclosure.'*
		- *'By writing about her time spent in mental institutions and her feelings of familial guilt, George demonstrates how many of Sexton's poems play with this most sacred taboo.'*
		- *'I find Bettelheim's reading of Oedipus convincing and important, if not entirely new: Oedipus is a hero who is fated to feel guilty for something he has done but did not know he was doing and did not mean to do; and, more importantly, he is a quester after truth against tremendous inner and external odds, determined to recognize the truth when he finds it, no matter how painful it may be for him and for other people he loves.'*
		- *'To be born a woman in patriarchy is often to be compelled to live out precisely the ritual. The maternal urge becomes a parody of its first manifestation in the desire to present the father with a child. This, in the tortured psychic world of the poem, is the only true marriage; all others are only pale and inadequate reflections of this primal union.'*
	- ### The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift - *Biographical Introduction by W.E.H. Lecky*
		- *'W.E.H. Lecky attempts to illuminate the temperament that produced such 'coarse and irreverent' works as Tale of a Tub and Gulliver's Travels.'*
		- *'Pouring a torrent of ridicule and hatred on all its opponents,' Swift incorporated taboo material in his writings for moral purposes. For Lecky, though Swift 'indulged more habitually in coarse, revolting, and indecent imagery' than any other author of this period, 'his faults in this respect are rather those of taste than of morals.'*
		- *'Lecky concludes that Swift's satirical use of the taboo was also precipitated by his melancholic worldview: 'It was his deliberate opinion that man is hopelessly corrupt, that the evil preponderates over the good, and that life itself is a curse.'*
		- *'According to Lecky, this perspective informs Gulliver's Travels: as Swift himself once wrote, he intended his most famous work 'to vex the world rather than divert it.'*
	- ### Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy - *Tess of the D'Urbervilles: The Pure Woman by Geoffrey Wagner'*
		- *'Geoffrey Wagner examines Thomas Hardy's portrayal of femininity and its relation to the views of D.H. Lawrence and Simone de Beauvoir, as well as biological and anthropological debates regarding gender difference.'*
		- *'Writing 'in a culture which constantly took offence at the reading of erotic betrayal as prototypical of religious betrayal, and/or vice versa,' Hardy's novel explores how society 'executes Tess, as it did Camus's Meursault, and for not entirely dissimilar reasons.'*
		- *'In neither case is the murder the guilt; the revolt against convention is the real guilt.'*
		- *'Thus, for Wagner, Hardy's novel criticizes the double standard of an unjust, male-dominated society where feminine sexuality is held to be taboo and 'the female is the victim of the species'*
		- *'Hardy takes pains to present Tess as both a living, breathing, individual woman and one trying hard to defer to the models in her culture. In short, she exemplifies what one feminist has defined as  modern woman's true tragedy-'the sad thing for women is that they have participated in the destruction of their own eroticism.'*
		- *'It is important to be clear about Hardy's intentions here from the start. For his own reticences, compounded with those of his time, sometimes obscure-certainly for the contemporary student steeped in libertine literature-what shimmers through the imagery, in a manner in which of course it does in life. Tess liked sex.'*
		- *'Hardy has here seen that a moment has come in our civilization when meekness and humility are no longer values in the true sense...and all the less so since we pay such loud lip-service to them in church. We talk a lot about the virtues of humility, but, in American at any rate, encourage our sons to be aggressive, 'tough,' to 'lay' and 'whip their opposition in sports, to make a 'killing on the market.' We give meekness few emotional rights any more.'*
		- *'Intercourse must always have reproductive significance for the male. It does not so for the female: A woman ovulates, sheds an egg, usually but once a month, and during the long child-bearing period of her life is generally infertile; furthermore, ovulation is not with her response to copulation.'*
	- ### Ulysses by James Joyce - *Fetishizing the Bread of Everyday Life: The Taboo Gaze in 'Nausicaa' by Blake Hobby and Dustin Ryan*
		- *'When we think of James Joyce's Ulysses, it is easy to think of taboos, those things that we normally do not talk about in literature: fornication, excrement, urine, adultery, sadomasochism, racial epithets and slurs, foul language, and 'mutton kidneys that leave a faintly scented urine taste on the tongue'*
		- *'A fetish is any object to believed to have magical powers; fetishes are often surrounded by taboos.'*
		- *'There are two kinds of fetishized experiences working in 'Nausicaa,' both revolving around an adoring gaze.'*
		- *'Within the sight of each other, a man peers at a young woman on the beach while a congregation at a temperance retreat worships the Most Blessed Sacrament.'*
		- *'Bloom fetishizes Gerty and endows her with the 'pure' and 'angelic' qualities of the Virgin Mary, the Mary, Star of the Sea worshippers fetishize the consecrated Body of Christ. The adoring gaze unites sexual and religious scenes as the narrative voice shifts between the two fetishes. Thus, the objects of the Nausicaa' are not only deified, but are also sexualized.'*
		- *'Joyce presents our desires and our fantasies, the stuff of the taboo, as sacramental. In that sense, Joyce ruins the sacred truths, leaving us with a portrait of our humanity with all our foibles intact, presenting our taboos for the fetishes we make them to be.'*
- # THE TRICKSTER
  collapsed:: true
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665983495195_0.png)
	- ## The Trickster according to Bloom...
		- *'The figure of the Trickster is all but universal in the world's cultures, and generally emerged from shamanistic origins. Folklore and anthropology are essential to the study of the Trickster, and I particularly recommend the religious historian Mircea Eliade's seminal study, Shamanism.'*
		- *'This though is a volume about the literary theme of the trickster.'*
		- *'All 'practical jokesters' are tricksters, but the converse scarcely is true. Odysseus-Ulysses is the archetype of the survivor, and you do not want to be in the same boat with him. He will reach the shore, you will drown.'*
		- *'The evil trickster in the highest degree in Shakespeare is Iago, the truest diabolos in all of literature. The clowns and fools in the Shakespearean cosmos are too wise to be innocent but also too benign to be harmful.'*
		- *'Shakespeare balances his clowns and sprites between the Chaucerian models of the likeable but ambiguous Alice, the Wife of Bath, and the uncanny Pardoner, who is suspended between cupidity and faith.'*
		- *'The master of the trickster theme in modern literature, Franz Kafka, is a link to its long history in Yiddish culture, including on the stage and in prose fiction. After Kafka, we are all tricksters, evading our doom as best we can.'*
	- ## The Trickster according to Literature
		- ### The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn - *The Trickster Tricked: Huck Comes Out of the Fog in Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*
			- *'Mark Twain's great novel Huckleberry Finn is a book brimming with tricks, trickery, and tricksters.'*
			- *'Tricks of this sort help make Huckleberry Finn enormously funny, but sometimes the tricks have a darker and more disturbing effect. This is especially true of the tricks played on black characters, and it is particularly true of the trick played by Tom on Jim in the final chapters of the novel.'*
			- *'The paragraphs that now follow are among the most famous and most important in the novel: They mark a significant moment of transformation, a crucial stage in Huck's moral maturation and in his development toward ethical adulthood. What begins as a trick on Jim, designed to make him look and feel foolish, soon evolves into an episode in which it is Huck who not only behaves like a fool but eventually feels far worse than one.'*
			- *'The more Huck deliberately deceives Jim, however, the more Huck ironically enters into his own kind of moral fog.'*
			- *'It is only because Jim trusts Huck so deeply and feels such affection for him that he finally falls for Huck's trick. Indeed, only after Jim has begun to fall for Huck's trickery does he begin to refer to him by name again, signifying the shift in his thinking.'*
			- *'By the end of Chapter 15, Jim has already begun to emerge as the central moral character of the book-a characterization that becomes even more obvious when Twain tricks the reader against at the end of Chapter 23 with Jim's surprising self-condemnation for what he considers his own blameworthy behavior toward his small daughter.'*
			- *'Twain continually surprises the reader with his depiction of Jim and the layers and depth he gives to a character who might have easily remained a mere stereotype.'*
	- ### The Works of Sherman Alexie - *Futuristic Hip Indian: Alexie by Kenneth Lincoln*
		- *'Kenneth Lincoln calls Sherman Alexie a 'Huckster, con man, carny barker, stand-up comedian, Will Rogers to Jonathan Winters, Cheech & Chong to Charlie Hill.'*
		- *'Lincoln, one of the most respected scholars in American Indian studies, outlines the many ways that Alexie himself is a trickster figure. Focusing on Alexie's difficult-to-classify works and also on his public persona, Lincoln sees Alexie as a 'stand-up comedian' whose 'firecat imagination plays tricks on the reader, for our supposed good, for its own native delight and survival.'*
		- *'Lincoln argues that Alexie creates 'Indi'n vaudeville, then, stand-up comedy on the edge of despair.'*
	- ### The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade by Herman Melville - *The Confidence-Man: The Con-Man as Hero*
		- *'Paul Brodtkorb likens The Confidence-Man to modern works that challenge accepted notions of what it means to be human, convey a sense of absurdity, play with language and puns, and focus on the meaninglessness of existence.'*
		- *'For Brodtkorb, the protean confidence-man acts as a trickster, one who reveals the emptiness behind the world's many masks, the façade of meaning and order that crumbles under  his hoaxes.'*
		- *'As Brodkorb argues, the 'playful con-man, diffracted into various masquerades, is the hero of the book, its ground and condition, its spirit, and in his very playfulness even its potential savior. His presence is why the book still speaks to us today.'*
		- *'Brodtkorb challenges the reader to see Melville's confidence-man as a trickster whose machinations reveal the human experience as a masquerade: 'The book's basic vision is of masks; and underneath, masks, further masks; and under all masks there is more than a chance that there is nothing at all.'*
		- *'Much of The Confidence-Man's irony is directed against ordinary unconscious humanity because it blandly assumes that it knows itself when in fact it does not; usually, it is directed against the opposition between the Christian principles mouthed and the un-Christian principles acted.'*
		- *'Beyond this subjectivity, beyond the confidence-man's exploitation of his knowledge of this subjectivity, can be seen the fundamental ontological reason for human inconsistency: there is finally, no such thing as character.'*
		- *'Even in theories of character older and simpler than that of this book, self-knowledge is arrived at through subtle processes and is not easy. But in the book's perspective on human inconsistency, a further implication suggests itself: a precondition of knowing oneself would be personal consistency, yet a man could be consistent only if he had an immutable essence, or if he had a static idea of Man good for all occasions to which he could refer as if it were his essence.'*
		- *'A sense of impossibility of self-knowledge as well as knowledge of others underlies Mark Winsome's questions: 'What are you? What am I? Nobody knows who anybody is.' Incompatible as these questions are with his other doctrines of labels and universal goodness-'Emersonian' doctrines mocked by the entire narrative-Winsome in these questions implies the roots of his own inconsistency. Nobody knows self or other because there is no self or other to know; only roles exist, but roles change, and as they do, so, correlatively, do beliefs, the foundations of 'character.'*
		- *'To sum up: the novel tends to see human reality as confined to appearances. Roles, masquerades, are as far as one can go in determining a man's 'reality' at any given moment, and a role is probably the best that a man can be consistent with because, as the misanthropic one-legged man (therefore a one-sided man, according to the confidence-man, but he is more than adequately accurate about what is going on around him) says, "All doers are actors.'*
		- *'Every character in the book demonstrates its truth by 'acting' in the ordinary sense of playing a set or given role; like 'Signor Marzetti in the African pantomime,' they play 'the intelligent ape' till they seem it.'*
		- *'With masquerade spreading its meaning to include all the book's characters, a simple attitude of approval or disapproval of hypocrisy becomes, even for the characters themselves, irrelevant.'*
		- *'Rather masquerading seems in the book less a question of moral choice than a question of necessity, beyond which it can become a way of testing a dangerous, shifty world to see how it will react to one's posited self: it becomes a mask from behind which to reconnoiter.'*
		- *'Greed, egotism, and so forth operate in [con-men] rather mechanically. Such motives, so presented, are not very interesting in themselves and quickly pall. But the cosmopolitan is different. To a brother con-man, he is loyal. Further, in contrast to the dupes, his motives are pure: he cheats for the sake of cheating.'*
		- *'In short, we admire the final confidence-man: we respect his authority, his mastery, his paradoxical constancy, and what can only be called the disinterest of his motives. But our admiration is highly detached: it is manifested in something like amused contemplation, a distanced emotion.'*
		- *'The Confidence-Man, besides being a nihilistic gloss on 'All the world's a stage,' assumes with Ahab in his worst moments that beyond the mask lies the naught. Which is why the playful con-man, diffracted into various masquerades, is the hero of the book, its ground and condition, its spirit, and in his very playfulness even its potential savior. His presence is why the book still speaks to us today.'*
	- ### Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio - *Games of Laughter by Giuseppe Mazzotta*
		- *'Offering a comprehensive approach to Boccaccio's tales, Giuseppe Mazzotta focuses on the way laughter and games function in the Decameron.'*
		- *'For Mazzotta, 'Boccaccio shows both how laughter is a hollow mask which deceives, blinds us to what we lose, and how it is produced by a mask behind which the tricksters try and appropriate the world and...enjoy it.'*
		- *'Thus, as Boccaccio's stories are filled with tricksters, Boccaccio himself is a trickster, one who never provides a fixed authorial viewpoint from which the reader can begin to interpret his work.'*
		- *'By showing how Boccaccio subverts thought and plays with others' ideas, Mazzotta attempts to wrestle the Decameron away from medieval notions of reality and reductive critical interpretations, instead presenting it as ultimately irreducible, the masterwork of a playful disassembler.'*
		- *'The Decameron constantly moves between the dream of utopia and the pleasure of the representation: laughter is the precarious point where these polarities intersect and at the same time pull apart. This constant movement discloses laughter as the domain of the imaginary which seeks pretexts and occasions to become 'real' and is always a put-on.'*
		- *'The rhetorical name for this movement is catachresis, the figure of a borrowed property, the elusive borderland of madness where all efforts at sense are defied.'*
	- ### The Novels of William Golding - *The Prometheus Myth in the Novels of William Golding by Sohana Manzoor*
		- *'In his novels, William Golding often employs the image of suffering trickster Prometheus. Traditionally seen as a champion of mankind, Prometheus is the bringer of techne and fire.'*
		- *'For the classical Greek writer Aeschylus, Prometheus was a rebel, one who defied the gods by befriending humanity. He has also been seen as a trickster figure who upset the order of the human and the divine.'*
		- *'For his defiance, Prometheus is bound to a rock for eternity with a cruel punishment: Every day Zeus, in the form of an eagle, eats out his liver, which then regrows so that his torment is endless and excruciating.'*
		- *'For Sohana Manzoor, the Prometheus figure in the novels of William Golding represent humanity in the form of the trickster.'*
		- *'Golding's novels reflect a deep interest in mankind. He seems, however, not so much concerned about the redeeming features of human nature, but concentrates on the depraved side.'*
		- *'In his work, the fallen or the debased aspects of man and his intense sufferings are inter-linked, since his fallen nature goads man to commit sin and sin leads to suffering.'*
		- *'Yet Golding does not necessarily follow the traditional formula of sin-suffering-redemption. There is no perfect redemption in Golding's world, as he describes the complex world of modern men. These men suffer without knowing the reason for their suffering, and sometimes their whole lives are spent thus. Even if they know the reason, they cannot always help it.'*
		- *'A faithless, God-defying utilitarian-that is how modern man is, as portrayed by Golding.'*
		- *'Golding's men deliberately choose a safe aesthetic creed that does not demand religious practices. But this belief can scarcely sustain them. Whenever they are dragged out of their puny shells to confront things beyond their comprehension, they collapse. Those that survive often turn into half-crazy monomaniacs like Barclay or groveling creatures like Jocelyn in The Spire.'*
		- *'Perhaps what Golding wants to suggest is that human beings have never been quite ready to accept all that modern technology has offered them.'*
		- *'A critic of the lack of morality in modern men, Golding nevertheless follows the footsteps of his subjects closely and sympathetically. Understanding the intensity of man's suffering and pain, he shows that in a world such as ours, no redeemer can be perfect. In view of all these ideas, Golding's visions have been often termed pessimistic.'*
		- *'The figure of Prometheus, however, stands as a savior of mankind. By bringing back this redeeming symbol from time to time, Golding perhaps wanted to indicate that even though the world is corrupt and vile, there is always a possibility of redemption.'*
		- *'True that his Promethean characters are not always strong or faultless, or even effective enough to enlighten the dark, chaotic world, yet they symbolize the undying human spirit that refuses to surrender in the most oppressive and overwhelming situation'*
	- ### Hamlet by Youknowho - *The Grave Diggers in Hamlet by Frederick Warde*
		- *'In this selection from The Fools of Shakespeare: An Interpretation of Their Wit, Wisdom, and Personalities, Frederick Warde explicates one of the comic scenes in this famous tragedy-the passage in which the two men, who, in digging Ophelia's grave, engage in playful conversation, bantering with each other and Hamlet.'*
		- *'For Warde, the two are the sort of tricksters one might find in everyday life, artful representations fashioned by Shakespeare, the ultimate artisan, who captures the most poignant sentiment, infuses it with wit, and gives performers endless possibilities for play.'*
		- *'Thus, Warde concludes by regaling us with anecdotes about actors as tricksters who elicit laughter from audiences and one another.'*
	- ### House Made of Dawn by N. Scott Momaday - *The Trickster Discourse of House Made of Dawn by Susan R. Bowers
		- *'N. Scott Momaday's House Made of Dawn, the novel that inaugurated the Native American literary renaissance and helped force scholars and other readers to take Native American literature seriously, turned 40 in 2008.'*
		- *'The novel's use of 'trickster energy' allowed Momaday both to draw attention to the boundaries between cultures and to show how individuals caught in the no-man's-land can find their way'*
		- *'After serving his prison term, [Abel] is relocated to Los Angeles, where he finds a community of displaced Native Americans, but nonetheless is profoundly alienated. When he returns home again after a deadly beating, he discovers that his grandfather is dying.'*
		- *'Abel cannot re-enter tribal society because his experiences outside the tribe-in the war and latter in prison and Los Angeles-have so estranged him from its relationships and practices. But his tribal upbringing also renders him incapable of joining the majority culture, so that he becomes the quintessential outsider, wandering in the liminal space of the in-between.'*
		- *'The in-between, the space between boundaries of all kinds, is the realm of the trickster, an ancient figure who is sometime messenger and sometime thief, mediator between heaven and earth, the living and the dead.'*
		- *'Tricksters are characteristic of many cultures, but as Alan R. Velie declares, 'The trickster is an archetype universal among Indians, and in most tribes the most important mythic figure.'*
		- *'Tricksters are multidimensional. Michael Carroll contends that Trickster's two most important roles, usually held at the same time, are as selfish buffoon and the culture hero 'who makes human society possible.'*
		- *'The Native American trickster possesses the traits of such creatures as coyotes and ravens. Velie points out that Momaday has been influenced by the Kiowa and Blackfeet tricksters (Sendeh and Napi, respectively.) Both are benefactors of their tribes-Sendeh provides the Kiowa with the buffalo and the sun, and Napi is the creator of the Blackfeet.'*
		- *'But he notes that these 'tricksters are amoral figures' with huge appetites who are 'usually irresponsible and often cruel and bloody.'*
		- *'Vizenor seems to be saying that these narratives are not so much a stable whole as a fragile construction made of pieces of stories, a construction that, like a trickster, can change shape at any time. '*
		- *'In this way, House Made of Dawn mimics the temporality of oral narrative, so that for any given reader, it is a particular momentary whole constantly on the verge of collapse. In a similar vein, Amy J. Elias identifies what she calls a 'coyote aesthetics' that features the fragmentation of trickster tales and the constant flux of the trickster world.'*
		- *'Most significantly, she points out that this aesthetics can 'allow Native American writers to counter Gayatri Spivak's claim that 'There is no space from where the subaltern...subject can speak.'*
		- *'The instability of trickster discourse, its fragility and invitation to deconstruction, allows both author and reader to enter the liminal, interactive world of oral storytelling, which, in turn, places both writer and reader in the world of the trickster.'*
		- *'The idea that the narrative is a site of trickster energy is augmented by the presence of characters who exhibit trickster characteristics.'*
		- *'Tosamah's trickster role, however, is demonstrated most powerfully through how he epitomizes the power of words, since words carry such enormous power in American Indian culture, as Gary Witherspoon found when he studied the Navajo: 'By speaking properly and appropriately one can control and compel the behavior and power of the gods.'*
		- *'Momaday has written, 'A word has power in and of itself it comes from nothing into sound and meaning; it gives origin to all things. By means of words can a man deal with the world on equal terms.'*
	- ### A Hunger Artist by Franz Kafka - *Making the Incomprehensible Incomprehensible: The Trickery of Kafka's A Hunger Artist by John Becker*
		- *'Much like his hunger artist, we starve in Kafka's world. The ambiguities and contradictions we encounter in his stories are carefully constructed to starve readers of plausible answers. In so far as we can think of Kafka as a writer of oblique tales that defy expectation, 'common sense,' and easily digestible glosses, he resembles the figure of the trickster.'*
		- *'Found in the mythology of many different cultures, the half-divine trickster is a liminal figure poised on the threshold between life and death, the profane and the sacred, mortal and divine.'*
		- *'Mircea Eliade asserts that the trickster figure's presence in sacred literature '...reflects what can be called a mythology of the human condition. He opposes God's decision to make man immortal and to assure him an existence somehow paradisiacal, in a pure and rich world free of all contraries.'*
		- *'Thus, the trickster, a deceiving and fallible being who actively frustrates the orderliness of creation, is for Eliade a mythic personification of the ambivalences and mystery we encounter in an imperfect world.'*
		- *'As William Hynes notes in his deft and nuanced discussion of the trickster across cultures, 'all semblances of truth and falsity are subject to his rapid alchemy.'*
		- *'Many of Kafka's stories resemble parables, a genre of writing that employs allegory to demonstrate a moral truth.'*
		- *'The inversion of the hunger artist's martyrdom and its relationship to life and death is typical of trickster tales. In such tales, tricksters are mediators capable of crossing and redefining the divide between life and death.'*
		- *'As William Hynes notes, 'As situation-invertor, the trickster is often a psychopomp, a mediator who crosses and resets the lines between life and death...More often associated with conducting individuals to restored life, he can also be the messenger of death.'*
		- *'For Kafka, parables that point unequivocally to the sacred wisdom they are meant to demonstrate do so untruthfully; only through indeterminate, playful language can we begin to confront what is beyond our experience.'*
	- ### A Midsummer Night's Dream by Youknowho - *This Sport Well Carried Shall Be Chronicled: Puck as Trickster in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream by Robert C. Evans'*
		- *'Part of the problem of dealing with any figure as a trickster is the problem of defining the crucial term. William J. Hynes and William G. Doty, in one of the best available anthologies and overviews dealing with the topic (Mythical Trickster Figures: Contours, Contexts, and Criticisms) note that many disagreements and debates that occur among scholars who have long studied the issue.'*
		- *'They report, for instance, that some writers 'see the trickster as so universal a figure that all tricksters speak with essentially the same voice,' while other scholars 'counsel the tricksters belonging to individual societies are so culture-specific that no two of the articulate the same messages.'*
		- *'Although tricksters are often 'comical if not marginal figures' in many traditions, 'they represent sacred beings in some cultures, but not in others.'*
		- *'Moreover, some scholars have argued that the trickster 'figure progress developmentally within cultures as within an individual's psychological growth, learning over time to deal with its bodily and sexual appetites. Hence the figure represents a sort of primitive developmental level common to humanity.'*
		- *'One scholar has listed as many as sixteen different traits that allegedly characterize the typical trickster figure, while other students of the phenomenon have listed as few as six.'*
		- *'It is with little wonder, then, that in his last lines in the play, Puck the trickster calls himself 'honest Puck' and emphasizes his desire to 'be friends' and to 'restore amends.'*
		- *'In these lines, Punk is no longer playing the trickster as mischievous, deceitful thief or potentially malevolent practical joker; by this point he has become the trickster as comrade and kindly benefactor, the trickster as well-intentioned messenger sent, if not from the gods, then at least from a supremely creative and benevolent mind.'*
	- ### Odyssey by Homer - *A General View of the Epic Poem, and the Iliad and Odyssey by Rene Le Bossu*
		- *'A storyteller who is aided and disguised by the goddess Athena, Ulysses (Odysseus) survives as a kind of trickster, who foils his adversaries by artful deception.'*
		- *'In the following excerpt, Rene Le Bossu uses Aristotle's criteria in Poetics to evaluate both the Odyssey and the qualities and characteristics of Ulysses.'*
		- *'Bossu's Treatise of the Epick Poem is important for what it says and also for what others have said about it. Bossu's analysis is invaluable in coming to understand Ulysses's wily authorial ways. In the end, Bossu concludes that Ulysses' tricks demonstrate his wisdom, that the 'dissimulation of Ulysses is a part of his prudence.'*
		- *'As the truth which serves for foundation to this fiction is that the absence of a person from his own home or his neglect of his own affairs is the cause of great disorders, so the principal point of the action, and the most essential one, is the absence of the hero. This fills almost all the poem.'*

	- ### On the Road by Jack Kerouac - *Faith on the Run by Gary Lindberg*
		- *'In 'Faith on the Run,' Gary Lindberg examines Jack Kerouac's modern American trickster figure, ON the Road's Dean Moriarty, and his inspiration, Kerouac's friend Neal Cassady.'*
		- *'Lindberg describes Moriarty as a kind of Walt Whitman on speed, a con man with an affable and transgressive attitude: 'The world of particulars and appearances is a world of hassles and misleading entanglements, and much as Dean delights in complication, he leaves it behind on the road, rising above it, cruising past it, seeing beyond it, restoring his sense of control and order and personal authority.'*
		- *'Lindberg argues that by presenting Moriarty as 'an archaic trickster whose primal energy crashes through all cultural bounds,' Kerouac creates a breaker of taboos, a universal figure who inspires others in his pursuit of 'the ragged and ecstatic joy of pure being.'*
		- *'The faith they [confidence men] appeal to is not directed towards something else-faith in God or faith that the railroad will run by one's land. It is reflexive. A person with 'faith' in this sense is healthy, expansive, and energetic.'*
		- *'Although such a state of faith is a personal experience, it can also be shared. That is what the word confidence is all about. The person with extraordinary, buoyant, all-purpose faith and its accompanying energy can radiate this inner state to others.'*
		- *'He is, in the purest sense of the term, a confidence man, a sharer of the faith. In his presence something almost takes place. But since there is no sacramental ground for him, no elevating official ritual, his touches of divinity are encased in more squalid circumstances, and he is as likely to appear in a carnival as in a church.'*
		- *'Speed was Cassady's obsession. Acquaintances spoke of him as the fastest man alive. He ran instead of walking, honed his reflexes for quickness, drove fast so as to keep on the very edge between control and adventure.*
		- *'If the contemporary world involves rapid changes, perpetual complications, overturning's of the familiar, or what Alvin Toffler calls 'the kinetic image,' Neal Cassady had a way of riding its changes for thrills. Instead of worrying about disruptions of the present scenario, he delighted in the making and revising of schedules and thrived on the breathless movement from one situation to another.'*
		- *'The various re-creations of these monologues indicate that they were basically narratives of events and emotional entanglements, so rapid and digressive, so full of mishaps and mad scramblings, as to suggest that Cassidy in words was always trying to catch up with Cassidy in action.'*
		- *'What people saws in Neal Cassady's feverish activity was simply a modernized version of a very familiar American type, the protean, yeasaying bearer of confidence.'*
		- *'Sal Paradise, the narrator of Jack Keroac's On the Road, sees the book's central character, Dean Moriarty, as a hero in a variety of American styles--the spirit of the West, the energetic mover and doer, the cowboy, the Whitman-like enthusiast, 'that mad Ahab at the wheel' compelling others at hissing, incredible speeds across the country. But the subsuming model for the Cassady legend is of the American hero as a confidence man.'*
		- *"In Sal's usage, 'con-man' is a phrase of admiration-'the holy con-man with the shining mind,' 'a great amorous soul such as only a con-man can have'-and the novel explores the meaning and value of a confidence man in modern American life.'*
		- *'Sal Paradise is essential to the creation of a con man as hero, for someone has to register that radiant energy, someone has to receive and interpret it, almost like a priest.'*
	- ### Orlando by Virginia Wolf - *With Orlando in Wonderland by Rossitsa Artemis*
		- *'Considered by many literary critics a key text in feminism and, undoubtedly, a significant Modernist text, Orlando: A Biography especially challenges the readers' understanding of three key concepts in fiction: time, setting, and character.'*
		- *'The influential French philosopher Henri Bergson, a contemporary of Woolf's, distinguishes between the concept of temps (clock time), and duree (psychological time), and argues that clock time produces a false idea of time, an idea pinned to clocks and calendars and their pseudo-precision in measuring human time.'*
		- *'Psychological time, on the other hand, accounts for the individual consciousness and the way time becomes dissolved into 'moments of being' coexistent and coextensive as Woolf liked to imagine them.'*
		- *'However parodic in its conception, Orlando still speaks about the difficulties in narrating human consciousness and complex perceptions that inhabit it and form the self's relation to time and environment.'*
		- *'In Woolf's hands, even the most categorical and undeniable matter for the biographer, the length of the subject's life, becomes relative and negotiable.'*
		- *'As the biographer writes the story of Orlando's life and as Orlando herself contemplates the world that engulfs her, an amazing narrative that questions time and space, selves and gender identities, unfolds for the reader.'*
		- *'It portrays the picaresque life of the ultimate trickster: one who outwits past, present, and future in her longevity and protean identity.'*
	- ### Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead by Tom Stoppard - *Tom Stoppard as Trickster in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead*
		- *'There is much about Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead that leaves the audience with the distinct impression of being had. The audience is likely, even, to find itself sympathizing with Guildenstern from the opening scene, as Guildenstern considers whether calling heads, spinning, and losing more than 90 coins in succession means that 'We are now within, un-, sub-, or supernatural forces.'*
		- *'Here and throughout the play, we are left with the unmistakable impression that someone-or something-is making Rosencrantz and Guildenstern the butt of a grand cosmic and/or literary joke, that some trickster is causing the coins to fall as so not to comport with the laws of probability.'*
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  *'Trickster is at one and the same time creator and destroyer, giver and negator, he who dupes others and who is always duped himself. He wills nothing consciously. At all times he is constrained to behave as he does from impulses over which he has no control. He knows neither good nor evil yet he is responsible for both. He possesses no values, moral, or social, is at the mercy of his passions and appetites, yet through his actions all values come into being'*
		                                                                                                                 - Paul Radin
		  
		  #+END_QUOTE
		- *'What Stoppard is implying, then, is that Shakespeare, not himself, is the master trickster, as it is Shakespeare who has sentenced Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to an endless cycle of inevitable marches towards certain death, a perspective of Shakespeare that is wholly and uniquely Stoppard's.'*
	- ### Tar Baby by Toni Morison Praisesong for the Widow Paule Marshall - *The Journey as Crossing by Alma Jean Billingslea-Brown*
		- *'Alma Jean Billingslea-Brown discusses the original Tar Baby trickster tale and then analyzes how protagonists with trickster-like qualities confront folk roots and values in Toni Morrison's Tar Baby and Paule Marshall's Praisesong for the Widow'*
		- *'For Billingslea-Brown, both Tar Baby and Praisesong for the Widow treat rural communities in the South, which 'represent a return to folk roots, to folk values and traditions with which the protagonist must first reconnect, then accept or deny.'*
		- *'Defining the character's development and marking identity, these places are vital links in the expression of the 'return to the source' as affirmation of cultural continuity.'*
		- *'Billingslea-Brown contends that while the values and traditions that define the cultural identities are approached differently by their respective trickster-esque protagonists, they are ultimately salvaged and reclaimed by the conclusions.'*
		- *'To advance their thematic definitions of continuity and inscribe the motif of return, Toni Morrison and Paule Marshall both effect literal and metaphorical crossings of spatial, temporal, and cultural borders.'*
		- *'Using the structural device of the journey as voluntary movement across space and time, these two novels reverse and revise the historical journey of forced migration of African people to the New World. Beginning typically in the first cities of Europe and the United States, this journey advances to the Caribbean and concludes symbolically at the African 'source.'*
		- *'The literal crossings are mediated, however, with the configuration of the journey and a symbiology of place that situates folk communities in the rural south as crucial stopping points in the preparation for the final return.'*
		- *'These rural communities in the South represent a return to folk roots, to folk values and traditions with which the protagonist must first reconnect, then accept or deny.'*
	- ### The Tempest by Youknowwho - *The Tempest and A Midsummer's Night's Dream by Hermann Ulrici*
		- *'Hermann Ulrici examines the underlying view of existence suggested by the trickster figures that populate The Tempest's fantastical world.'*
		- *'Reading the play as an allegory of the struggle between good and evil, humanity and circumstance, Ulrici maintains that The Tempest is situated on the 'boundary where the airy kingdom of the land of wonders and mystery looks into the reality of every-day life, and conversely is looked by it.'*
		- *'According to Ulrici, 'Prospero's spirits are the personified resolves of fate, and Ariel, a kind of trickster, controls the 'pulse' of events in the play.'*
		- *'Every person of an imaginative or poetical turn of mind, probably knows from his own experience that peculiar state of mind, in which everything appears so strange, so mysterious and mystic that we can become wholly absorbed in the contemplations of a wild flower, of a murmuring brook, or of the hurrying clouds; a mood in which we feel as if, at every moment, something unheard-of must happen, or in which, at least, we long from the depths of our heart for some kind of wonderful occurrence, although in our immediate neighborhood everything moves on its usual course, nay although we ourselves feel perfectly content and happy in the everyday relations of our life and in our ordinary activity.'*
	- ### A Thousand and One Nights - *Seven Times a Trickster: The Tale of Sindbad by Monique Dasha Inciarte*
		- *'Deploying itself like a dizzying Chinese box, the story of Sindbad becomes a miniature of the central frame story of A Thousand and One Nights, a collection of stories about storytelling. Just as Shahrazad tells her stories to King Shahryar over many nights in intense episodes replete with monstrous creatures and spine-chilling cliffhangers, Sindbad the Seaman will tell his stories over seven evenings, seven riveting tales of voyage.'*
		- *'The desire and need to tell his story is one of the chief characteristics of the trickster Sindbad. Trickster myths often describe someone who justifies himself in his obsessive retelling. Tricksters have, above all, great rhetorical skill, and the retelling of their experience is often tailored to suit the audience and the need.'*
		- *'A trickster is always 'on the road' (or for our purposes, 'on the sea'); he is an inveterate traveler who cannot stay put.'*
		- *'Sindbad the trickster is perpetually in-between states and places: When he is in Baghdad he fancies the sea; when he is at sea he yearns for land; when he arrives at an exotic locale, he wants to return to Baghdad.'*
		- *'Lewis Hyde, in his book Trickster Makes this Word, describes the mythic trickster as 'the spirit of the doorway leading out, and of the crossroad of the edge of town...he is the spirit of the road at dusk, the one that runs from one town to another and belongs to neither.'*
		- *'Sindbad's travels showcase his superior cleverness and demonstrate how he exploits opportunity, as he 'regularly bumps into things he did not expect.' The last thing that needs to be said about Sindbad, and about all tricksters, is that they are exceedingly vital creatures Their supernatural urge to save themselves and survive what would kill any other being attests that they are in love with life.'*
	- ### Uncle Remus by Joel Chandler Harris - *Tricksters in Uncle Remus: His Songs and  Sayings by Robert C. Evans*
		- *'In other words, to what extent are both Remus and his creator more complex characters-more clever, more deceptive, more ironic and sly and manipulative-than they might initially seem?'*
		- *'One of the first critics to suggest a more complicated view of both Harris and Remus was Raymond Hedin, who argued in a 1982 article that Remus 'uses the tales and his own power as a storyteller to serve his own ends rather than anyone else,' and that 'Remus's innocence is more strategic than pastoral; he is never as guileless as he seems.'*
		- *'One of the most obvious and least controversial ways in which Remus is a trickster involves the various methods he actually uses to tell his tales.....Remus deliberately concludes on a note of suspense...Cunningly, then, Remus intentionally delays the much-desired ending of the story, postponing it for at least two evenings...…He is highly aware of his audience and of the impact he is having on the boy.'*
		- *'Numerous examples of this kind of narrative trickery-by both Remus and Harris-abound.'*
		- *'Perhaps the most intriguing examples of trickery by both Harris and Remus, however, involve those places in the tales where the stories about animals seem to reflect quite clearly the positions of blacks in pre-war and post-war Southern society.'*
		- *'Harris had thereby subtly invited his readers to interpret the tales as reflections on race relations, and some of the tales make it almost impossible to read them in any other way.'*
		- *'Continually, through the tales, Harris craftily uses Remus to suggest ideas that seem applicable to the injustices suffered by oppressed peoples.'*
		- *'At times the phrasing used by both Harris and Remus can seem positively disturbing in its racial overtones. Thus, during the course of telling one tale, Remus has promised to give the little boy a whip he has been making for him. At the end of the tale, Remus presents his gift, but he does so in a way that can seem unsettling to any reader familiar with the lynchings of blacks that were rampant in the South during the era when these tales were published.'*
		- *'Throughout the 'Remus' tales, Harris inserts moments that are potentially disturbing and unsettling for anyone familiar with abuses of power--abuses of the sort suffered by blacks both before and after the abolition of slavery.'*
		- *'The last comment-implying that 'fokes' have never gotten along very well together-is typical of the sly insinuations of which both Remus and Harris, as trickster-narrators, are so often capable. Remus explains how whites managed to wash off their blackness in a special pond, but the really memorable message of the tale is the one he emphatically repeats: 'de time wuz w'en we 'uz all niggers tergedder.' One implication of this statement-an implication borne out by the undeniable emotional power of the tales themselves-is that blacks, whites, despite their superficial differences, share a deeper bond than they might imagine.'*
		- *'Another implication is that although whites at present enjoy greater power than blacks, they may someday find themselves (either individually or as a group) returned to their original status as powerless 'niggers.'*
	- ### The Wife of Bath's Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer -  *Transforming the Trickster in Chaucer's Wife of Bath's Tale*
		- *'Chaucer uses familiar archetypes such as the trickster and the hero but often obscures fixed character identities. Determining the identity of the tricked and the trickster is not always an easy task. Likewise, the identity of the trickster often depends on the conventions of the genre used to tell the tale.'*
		- *'The romance as a genre has this unstable identity of the tricked and the trickster at its core. As William Paton Ker notes in Epic and Romance, 'Romance means nothing if it does not convey some notion of mystery and fantasy. To this extent, it lacks the direct statement of warlike virtue encountered in the epic.'*
		- *'The genre is typified by a tension resulting from the quest for a heroic ideal that remains, ultimately, unattainable. At the same time, this genre, built on quests, battles, and declarations of loyalty, or 'troth,' also revels in betrayal, games and impossible challenges.'*
		- *'Often, the token exemplifying the tale serves to remind characters and readers alike that the 'rules' governing a quest or game have, in fact, been broken and, simultaneously, fulfilled.'*
		- *'As an archetype, the trickster is characterized in two important ways: The most well known and obvious is that the trickster subverts authority. The less frequently considered corollary is that, in order to subvert authority, the trickster must somehow also lay claim to authority and the privileges and powers it bestows. Trickster characters like Loki in Norse myth or Raven in Native American folklore are also shape-shifters.'*
