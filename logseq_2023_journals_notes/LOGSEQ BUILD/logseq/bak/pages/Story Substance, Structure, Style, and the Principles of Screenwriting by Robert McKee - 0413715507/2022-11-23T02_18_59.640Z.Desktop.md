- # PART 1 - THE WRITER AND THE ART OF STORY
  collapsed:: true
	- ## INTRODUCTION
		- ### Story is about principles, not rules.
			- 'A rule says, 'You *must* do it *this way*.'
			- 'A principle says, 'This *works*...and has through all remembered time.'
			- 'Your work needn't be modeled after the 'well-made' play; rather, it must be *well made* within the principles that shape our art.
			- Anxious, and inexperienced writers obey rules.
			- Rebellious, unschooled writers break rules.
			- *Artists master the form.*
		- ### Story is about eternal, universal forms, not formulas.
			- 'All notions of paradigms and foolproof story models are nonsense.'
			- 'Despite trends we find an astounding variety of story designs, but no prototype.'
			- '*Story* urges the creation of works that will excite audiences and live in revival for decades.'
			- 'We need a rediscovery of the underlying tenets of our art, the guiding principles that liberate talent.'
		- ### Story is about archetypes, not stereotypes.
			- 'The archetypal story unearths a universally human experience, then wraps itself inside a unique, culture-specific expression.'
			- 'The stereotypical story reverses this pattern: It suffers a poverty of both content and form.'
			- 'An archetypal story creates settings and characters that are rare.'
			- 'Its telling illuminates conflicts so true to humankind that it journeys from culture to culture.'
			- 'Stereotypical stories stay at home, archetypal stories travel.'
			- 'No mater how intimate or epic, contemporary or historical, concrete or fantasized, the world of an eminent artist always strikes us as somewhat exotic or strange.'
			- 'We step wide-eyed into an untouched society, a cliché-free zone where the ordinary becomes extraordinary.'
			- 'Deep within these characters and their conflicts we discover our own humanity.'
			- 'We go to the movies to enter a new, fascinating world to inhabit vicariously another human being who at first seems so unlike us and yet at heart is like us, to live in a fictional reality that illuminates our daily reality.'
			- 'We do not wish to escape life but to find life, to use our minds in fresh, experimental ways, to flex our emotions, to enjoy, to learn, to add depth to our days.'
		- ### Story is about thoroughness, not shortcuts.
			- 'There's been no conspiracy to keep secret the truths of our art.'
			- 'The secrets of story have been as public as the library down the street.'
			- 'Nothing in the craft of storytelling is abstruse.'
			- 'If a writer fails to move us with the purity of a dramatized scene, he cannot hide behind his words.'
			- 'A writer cannot tell us what to think and how to feel.'
			- 'Writing is full of wonders but no unsolved mysteries.'
		- ### Story is about mastering the art, not second-guessing the marketplace.
			- 'No one can teach us what will sell, what won't, because *no one knows.'*
			- 'Nothing in our art is guaranteed.'
			- 'Rather than agonizing over the odds, put your energies into achieving excellence.'
			- 'Secure writers don't sell first drafts.'
			- 'Unfinished work invites tampering, while polished, mature work seals its integrity.'
		- ### Story is about respect, not disdain, for the audience.
			- 'When talented people write badly it's generally for one of two reasons:'
				- 'Blinded by an idea they're compelled to prove.'
				- 'Driven by an emotion they must express.'
			- 'When talented people write well, it is generally for this reason:'
				- 'They're moved by a desire to touch the audience.'
			- 'Filmgoers do not defend their emotions, rather they open to the storyteller often exhausting themselves.'
			- 'The audience is not only sensitive, but its collective IQ jumps twenty-five points.'
			- 'The audience is not only smart, it's smarter than most films.'
			- 'It's all a writer can do, using every bit of craft he's mastered, to keep ahead of the sharp perceptions of a focused audience.'
			- 'No film can be made to work without an understanding of the reactions and anticipations of the audience.'
			- 'You must shape your story in a way that both expresses your vision and satisfies the audience's desires.'
			- 'The audience is a force as determining of story design as any other element.'
		- ### Story is about originality, not duplication.
			- 'A story is not only what you have to say but how you say it.'
			- 'If content is cliché, the telling will be cliché.'
			- 'If your vision is deep and original, your story design will be unique.'
			- 'If the telling is conventional and predictable, it will demand stereotypical roles to act out of well-worn behaviors.'
			- 'If the story design is innovative, then settings, characters, and ideas must be equally fresh to fulfill it.'
			- 'We shape the telling to fit the substance, rework the substance to support the design.'
			- 'Never mistake eccentricity for originality.'
			- 'Difference for the sake of difference is empty.'
			- 'No serious writer would cage his vision inside a formula, or trivialize it into avant-garde fragmentations.'
			- ''Well-made formula may choke a story's voice, but art movie quirkiness will will make a bitch retarded.'
			- 'Too many filmmakers use infantile gimmicks on screen to mask their insecurities.'
			- 'A mature artist never calls attention to himself.'
			- 'A wise artist never does anything merely because it breaks convention.'
			- 'Great screenwriters are distinguished by a personal storytelling style that is inseparable from their vision, but in a profound way is their vision.'
			- 'The storyteller's story structure reveals his personal cosmology, his insight into the deepest patters and motivations for how and why things happen in the world-his map of life's hidden order.'
			- 'No matter who your heroes may be, we admire them because they are unique.'
			- 'Each has stepped out of the crowd because each selects a content like no one else, designs a form like no one else, combining the two into a style unmistakably his own.'
			- 'If you can't play every instrument in the orchestra, you are doomed to hum the same old tune.'
	- ## 1  THE STORY PROBLEM
		- ### THE DECLINE OF STORY
			- 'Day after day we seek an answer to the ageless question Aristotle posed in Ethics:'
				- 'How should a human being lead his life?'
				- 'But the answer eludes us.
			- 'To be entertained is to be immersed in the ceremony of story to an intellectually and emotionally satisfying end.'
			- 'All fine films, novels, and plays, through all shades of the comic and tragic, entertain when they give the audience a fresh model of life empowered with an affective meaning.'
			- 'Story isn't a flight from reality but a vehicle that caries us on our search for reality, our best effort to make sense out of the anarchy of existence.'
			- 'Media now gives us the opportunity to send stories beyond borders and languages to hundreds of millions, the overall quality of storytelling is eroding.'
			- 'Flawed and false storytelling is forced to substitute spectacle for substance, trickery for truth.'
			- 'Weak stories, desperate to hold audience attention, degenerate into multimillion-dollar demo reels.'
			- 'In Hollywood imagery becomes more and more extravagant, in Europe more and more decorative. The total effect transudes into the grotesque.'
			- 'A culture cannot evolve without honest, powerful storytelling.'
			- 'When society repeatedly experiences hollowed-out pseudo-stories, it degenerates.'
			- 'Asian filmmakers tell superb stories.'
		- ### THE LOSS OF CRAFT
			- 'The art of story is the dominant cultural force in the world.'
			- 'The art of film is the dominant medium.'
			- 'Today's would-be writers rush to the typewriter without first learning their craft.'
			- 'The knowledge they gain from reading and study equals or outweighs experience, especially if that experience goes unexamined.'
			- 'Self-knowledge is the key--life plus deep reflection on our reactions to life.'
			- 'What the novice mistakes for craft is simply his unconscious absorption of story elements from media consumed.'
			- 'The unschooled writer calls this 'instinct,' but it's merely habit and its rigidly limiting.'
			- 'The method of teaching creative writing in American universities has shifted from the intrinsic to the extrinsic.'
			- 'Trends in literary theory have drawn professors away from the deep sources of story towards language, codes, and text.'
			- 'The current generation of writers has been undereducated in the prime principles of story.'
			- 'Values, the positive/negative charges of life, are at the soul of our art.'
			- 'The writer shapes story around a perception of what's worth living for, what's worth dying for, what's foolish to pursue, the meaning of justice, truth-the essential values.'
			- 'The erosion of values has brought with it a corresponding erosion of story.'
		- ### THE STORY IMPERATIVE
			- 'Of the total creative effort represented in a finished work, 75 percent or more of a writer's labor goes into designing story.'
			- 'Designing story tests the maturity and insight of the writer, his knowledge of society, nature, and the human heart.'
			- 'Story demands both vivid imagination and powerful analytic thought.'
			- 'Each of the arts is defined by its essential form.'
			- 'A writer must grasp story *form*.'
		- ### GOOD STORY WELL TOLD
			- 'Good Story means something worth telling that the world wants to hear.'
			- 'Then you must bring to the work a vision that's driven by fresh insights into human nature and society, coupled with in-depth knowledge of your characters and your world.'
			- 'All that and a lot of love...'
				- 'The love of story--the belief that your vision can be expressed only through story, that characters can be more 'real' than people, that the fictional world is more profound than concrete.'
				- 'The love of truth--the belief that lies cripple the artist, that every truth in life must be questioned, down to one's own secret motives.'
				- 'The love of humanity--a willingness to empathize with suffering souls, to crawl inside their skins and see the world through their eyes.'
				- 'The love of sensation--the desire to indulge not only the physical but the inner senses.'
				- 'The love of dreaming--the pleasure in taking leisurely rides on your imagination just to see where it leads.'
				- 'The love of humor--a joy in the saving grace that restores the balance of life.'
				- 'The love of language--the delight in sound and sense, syntax and semantics.'
				- 'The love of duality--a feel for life's hidden contradictions, a healthy suspicion that things are not what they seem.'
				- 'The love of perfection--the passion to write and rewrite in pursuit of the perfect moment.'
				- 'The love of uniqueness--the thrill of audacity and a stone-faced calm when it is met by ridicule.'
				- 'The love of beauty--an innate sense that treasures good writing, hates bad writing, and knows the difference.'
				- 'The love of self--a strength that doesn't need to be constantly reassured, that never doubts that you are indeed a writer.'
				- 'You must love to write and bear the loneliness.'
			- 'Your goal must be a good story *well told.*'
			- 'This craft is neither mechanics nor gimmicks.'
			- 'It is the concert of techniques by which we create a conspiracy of interest between ourselves and the audience.'
			- 'Craft is the sum total of all means used to draw the audience into deep involvement, to hold that involvement, and ultimately to reward them with a moving and meaningful experience.'
			- 'Without craft, the best a writer can do is snatch the first idea off the top of his head, then sit helpless in front of his own work, unable to answer the dreaded questions: *Is it good? Or is it sewage? If sewage, what do?*
			- 'The conscious mind, fixated on these terrible questions, blocks the subconscious.'
			- 'When the conscious mind is put to work on the objective task of executing the craft, the spontaneous surfaces.'
			- 'Mastery of craft frees the subconscious.'
			- 'What is the rhythm of the writer's day?'
				- 'First you enter the imagined world.'
				- 'As characters speak and act, you write.'
			- 'What's the next thing you do?'
				- 'You step out of your fantasy and read what you've written.'
			- 'And what do you do as you read?'
				- 'You analyze, 'Is it good? Does it work? Why not? Should I cut? Add? Reorder?'
			- 'You write, you read; create, critique; impulse, logic; right brain, left brain; re-imagine, rewrite.'
			- 'And the quality of you rewriting, the possibility of perfection, depends on a command of the craft that guides you to correct imperfection.'
			- 'An artist is never at the mercy of the whims of impulse; he willfully exercises his craft to create harmonies of instinct and idea.'
		- ### STORY AND LIFE
			- 'The 'personal story' is a understructure, slice-of-life portraiture that mistakes verisimilitude for truth.'
			- Big 'T' Truth is located behind, beyond, inside, below the surface of things, holding reality together or tearing it apart, and cannot be directly observed.'
			- 'The 'guaranteed commercial success,' on the other hand, is an overstructured, overcomplicated, overpopulated assault on the physical sense that bears no relationship to life whatsoever. This writer is mistaking kinesis for entertainment.'
			- 'Spectacles of this kind replace imagination with simulated actuality.'
			- 'They use story as an excuse for heretofore unseen effects that carry us into a tornado, the jaws of a dinosaur, or futuristic holocausts. But like amusement park rides, their pleasures are short-lived.'
			- 'Every decade or so technical innovation spawns a swarm of ill-told movies, for the sole purpose of exploiting spectacle.'
			- 'The writers of portraiture and spectacle, indeed all writers, must come to understand the relationship of story to life: *Story is a metaphor for life.*
			- 'A story must abstract from life to discover its essences, but not become an abstraction that loses all sense of life-as-lived.'
			- 'A story must be *like* life, but not so verbatim that it has no depth or meaning beyond what's obvious to everyone on the street.'
			- 'Writers of portraiture must realize that facts are neutral.'
			- 'The weakest possible excuse to include anything in a story is: 'But it actually happened.''
			- 'Everything happens; everything imaginable happens.  But story is not life in actuality.'
			- 'Mere occurrence brings us nowhere near the truth.'
			- 'What happens is fact, not truth.'
			- 'Truth is what we *think about* what happens.'
			- 'Writers of spectacle must realize that abstractions are neutral.' (VFX, Editing, Sound, etc.)
			- 'The aesthetics of film are the means to express the living content of story, but must *never* become the end in themselves.'
		- ### POWERS AND TALENTS
			- 'Writers of portraiture or spectacle are weak in story, they may be blessed with one of two essential powers.'
				- 'Writers who lean toward reportage often have the power of the senses, the power to transport corporal sensations into the reader.'
				- 'Writers of action extravaganzas, on the other hand, often have the imaginative power to lift audiences beyond what is to what could be.'
				- 'Boy sensory perception and a lively imagination are enviable gifts, but, like a good marriage, one complements the other. Alone they are diminished.'
				- 'At one end of reality is pure fact; at the other end, pure imagination.'
				- 'Spinning these two poles is the infinitely varied spectrum of fiction.'
				- 'Strong storytelling strikes a balance along this spectrum.'
				- 'If your writing drifts to one extreme or the other, you must learn to draw all aspects of your humanity into harmony.'
				- 'You must place yourself along the creative spectrum: sensitive to sight, sound, and feeling, yet balancing that with the power to imagine.'
				- 'Writing also demands two singular and essential talents.'
					- 'The first is literary talent--the creative conversion of ordinary language into higher, more expressive form, vividly describing the world and capturing its human voices.'
					- 'The second is story talent--the creative conversion of life itself to a more powerful, clearer, more meaningful experience.'
					- 'Pure story talent is rare.'
					- 'Instinctive genius may produce a work of quality once, but perfection and prolificness do not flow from the spontaneous and untutored.'
					- 'Stories can be expressed any way human beings can communicate.'
					- 'The material of literary talent is words; the material of story talent is *life itself.*'
			- ### CRAFT MAXIMIZES TALENT
				- 'Given the choice between trivial material brilliantly told versus profound material badly told, an audience will always choose the trivial told brilliantly.'
				- 'Master storytellers know how to squeeze life out of the least of things, while poor storytellers reduce the profound to the banal.'
				- 'Story talent is primary, literary talent secondary but essential.'
				- 'Talent without craft is like fuel without an engine. It burns wildly but accomplishes nothing.'
				-
- # PART 2 - THE ELEMENTS OF STORY
	- > *A beautifully told story is a symphonic unity in which structure, setting, character, genre, and idea meld seamlessly. To find their harmony, the writer must study the elements of story as if they were instruments of an orchestra--first separately, then in concert.*
	- ## 2  THE STRUCTURE SPECTRUM
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### THE TERMINOLOGY OF STORY DESIGN
			- > *From an instant to eternity, from the intracranial to the intergalactic, the life story of each and every character offers encyclopedic possibilities. The mark of a master is to select only a few moments but give us a lifetime.*
			- 'The complex expanse of *life story* must become *the story told.'*
			- 'The *story told* is often the *life story*.'
		- ### STRUCTURE
			- 'A film isn't just moments of conflict or activity, personality or emotionality, witty talk or symbols.'
			- 'What the writer seeks are *events*, for an event contains all the above and more.'
			- > *STRUCTURE is a selection of events from the characters' life stories that is composed into a strategic sequence to arouse specific emotions to express a specific view of life.*
			- 'An event is caused by or affects people, thus delineating characters; it takes place in a setting, generating image, action, and dialogue; it draws energy from conflict producing emotion in characters and audience alike.'
			- 'Event choices cannot be displayed randomly or indifferently; they must be composed, and 'to compose' in story means much the same thing it does in music.'
			- 'What to include? To exclude? To put before and after what?'
			- 'To answer these questions you must know your purpose.'
			- 'The design of events needs a dual strategy.'
			-
			- #### Event
				- ''Event' means *change*.'
				- '*Story Events* are meaningful, not trivial.'
				- 'To make change meaningful it must, to begin with, happen to a character.'
				- > *A STORY EVENT creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a VALUE.*
				- 'To make change meaningful you must express it, and the audience must react to it, in terms of a value.'
				- '*Story Values* refers to the broadest sense of the idea. Values are the soul of storytelling. Ultimately ours is the art of expressing to the world a perception of values.'
				- > *STORY VALUES are the universal qualities of human experience that may shift from positive to negative, or negative to positive from one moment to the next.*
				- *'For example: alive/dead (positive/negative) is a story value, as are love/hate, freedom/slavery, truth/lie, etc.*
				- 'All such binary qualities of experience that can reverse their charge at any moment are STory Values.'
				- 'They may be...'
					- 'moral, good/evil;'
					- 'ethical, right/wrong;'
					- 'or simply charged with value.'
				- 'Although there's a place for coincidence in storytelling, a story cannot be built out of nothing but accidental events, no matter how charged with value.'
					- > *A Story Event creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a value and ACHIEVED THROUGH CONFLICT.*
			- #### Scene
				- > *A SCENE is an action through conflict in more or less continuous time and space that turns the value-charged condition of a character's life on at least one value with a degree of perceptible significance. Ideally, every scene is a STORY EVENT.*
				- 'Look closely at each scene you've written and ask:'
					- 'What value is at stake in my character's life at this moment?'
					- 'How is that value charged at the top of the scene?'
					- 'How is that value charged at the end of the scene?'
				- 'If the answer you write down at the end of the scene is the same note you made at the opening, you now have another important question to ask:'
					- 'Why is this scene in my script?'
				- 'If the value-charged condition of the character's life stays unchanged from one end of a scene to the other, nothing meaningful happens.'
				- 'The scene has activity--talking about this, doing that--but nothing changes in value. It is a nonevent.'
				- 'Why then is the scene in the story?'
				- 'The answer is almost certain to be 'exposition.'
				- 'It's there to convey information about characters, world, or history to the eavesdropping audience.'
				- 'If exposition is a scene's sole justification, a disciplined writer will trash it and weave its information into the film elsewhere.'
				- '*No scene that doesn't turn.* This is our ideal.'
				- 'We work to round every scene from beginning to end by turning a value at stake in a character's life from the positive to the negative or the negative to the positive.'
				- 'Adherence to this principle may be difficult, but it's by no means impossible.'
				- '*Action genres* turn on public values such as freedom/slavery or justice/injustice; the *Education genre* turns interior values such as self-awareness/self-deception or life as meaningful/meaningless.'
				- 'Regardless of genre, the principle is universal: If a scene is not a true event, cut it.'
				- > *Chris and Andy are in love and live together. They wake up one morning and start to squabble. Their spat builds in the kitchen as they hurry to make breakfast. In the garage, the fight becomes nastier as they climb into their car to drive to work together. Finally words explode into violence on the highway. Andy wrenches the car to the shoulder and jumps out, ending their relationship. This series of actions and locations creates a scene: It takes the couple from the positive (in love and together) to the negative (in hate and apart).*
				- 'The four shifts of place--bedroom to kitchen to garage to highway--are camera setups but not true scenes.'
				- 'Although they intensify behavior and make the critical moment credible, they do not change the values at stake.'
				- 'When the action reaches its Turning Point--a slamming car door and Andy's declaration, 'It's over!'--life turns upside down for the lovers, activity changes to action, and the sketch becomes a complete scene, a **Story Event**.'
				- 'The test of whether a series of activities constitutes a true scene is this:'
					- 'Could it have been written 'in one,' in a unity of time and place?'
				- 'In this case the answer is yes.'
				- 'A playwright might write this scene 'in one' because the staging limitations of the theatre often force us to keep the unities of time and place; the novelist or the screenwriter, on the other hand, might travel the scene, parsing it out in time and space to establish future locations, Chris's taste in furniture, Andy's driving habits--for any number of reasons.'
				- 'The variations are endless, but in all cases this is a single Story Event, the 'lovers break up' scene.'
			- #### Beat
				- 'Inside the scene is the smallest element of structure, the *Beat.*'
				- > *A BEAT is an exchange of behavior in action/reaction. Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene.*
				- 'Taking a closer look at the "lovers break up" scene:'
					- 'As the alarm goes off. Chris teases Andy and he reacts in kind. As they dress, teasing turns to sarcasm and they throw insults back and forth. Now in the kitchen Chris threatens Andy with: 'If I left you, baby, you'd be so miserable...' but he calls his bluff with 'That's a misery I'd love.' In the garage Chris, afraid he's losing him, begs Andy to stay, but he laughs and ridicules his plea. Finally, in the speeding car, Chris doubles his fist and punches Andy. A fight, a squeal of brakes. Andy jumps out with a bloody nose, slams the door and shouts, 'It's over,' leaving him in shock.'
						- 'This scene is built around six beats, six distinctively different behaviors, six clear changes of action/reaction: teasing each other, followed by a give-and-take of insults, then threatening and daring each other, next pleading and ridiculing, and finally exchanges of violence that lead to the last Beat and Turning Point: Andy's decision and action that ends the relationship and Chris's dumbfounded surprise.'
			- #### Sequence
				- 'Beats build scenes.'
				- 'Scenes then build the next largest movement of story design, the *Sequence.'*
				- 'Every true scene turns the value-charged condition of the character's life, but from event to event the degree of change can differ greatly.'
				- 'Scenes cause relatively minor yet significant change.'
				- 'The capping scene of a sequence, however, delivers a more powerful, determinant charge.'
				- > *A SEQUENCE is a series of scenes--generally two to five--that culminates with greater impact than any previous scene.*
				- 'It's useful to title each sequence to make clear to yourself why it's in the film.'
				- 'The story purpose of this 'getting the job' sequence is to take her from *NO JOB* to *JOB.*'
			- #### Act
				- 'Scenes turn in *minor* but significant ways; a series of scenes builds a sequence that turns into a *moderate*, more impactful way; a series of sequences builds the next largest structure, the *Act*, a movement that turns on a *major* reversal in the value-charged condition of the character's life.'
				- 'The difference between a basic scene, a scene that climaxes a sequence, and a scene that climaxes an act is the degree of change, or, more precisely, the degree of impact that change has, for better or worse, on the character--on the character's inner life, personal relationships, fortunes in the world, or some combination of all these.'
				- > *An ACT is a series of sequences that peaks in a climactic scene which causes a major reversal of values, more powerful in its impact than any previous sequence or scene.*
			- #### Story
				- 'A series of acts builds the larges structure of all: the *Story*.'
				- 'A story is simply one huge master event.'
				- 'When you look at the value-charged situation in the life of the character at the beginning of the story, then compare it to the value-charge at the end of the story, you should see the *arc of the film*, the great sweep of change that takes life from one condition at the opening to a changed condition at the end.'
				- 'The final condition, this end change, must be *absolute* and *irreversible*.'
				- 'Change caused by a scene could be reversed: The lovers in the previous sketch could get back together; people fall in and out and back in love again every day.'
				- 'A sequence could be reversed: The Midwest businesswoman could win her job only to discover that she reports to a boss she hates and wishes she were back in Terre Haute.'
				- 'An act climax could be reversed: A character could die, as in the Act Two climax of E.T., and then come back to life.'
				- 'Scene by sequence by act, the writer creates minor, moderate, and major change, but conceivably, each of those changes could be reversed.'
				- 'This is not, however, the case in the climax of the last act.'
				- > *STORY CLIMAX: A story is a series of acts that build to a last act climax or story climax which brings about absolute and irreversible change.*
				- 'If you make the smallest element do its job, the deep purpose of the telling will be served.'
		- ### THE STORY TRIANGLE
			- 'Plot is an accurate term that names the internally consistent, interrelated pattern of events that move through time to shape and design a story.'
			- > *To PLOT means to navigate through the dangerous terrain of story and when confronted by a dozen branching possibilities to choose the correct path. Plot is the writer's choice of events and their design in time.*
			- 'In either third-person or first-person, the novelist can directly invade thought and feeling to dramatize the tale entirely on the landscape of the protagonist's inner life.'
			- 'For the screenwriter such stories are far the most fragile and difficult.'
			- 'As John Carpenter said, 'Movies are about making mental things physical.'
			- 'Plot doesn't mean ham-handed twists and turns, or high-pressure suspense and shocking surprise.'
			- 'Events must be selected and their patterning displayed through time.'
			- 'In this sense of composition or design, all stories are plotted.'
			-
			- #### Archplot, Miniplot, Antiplot
				- 'The far corners of the art create a triangle of formal possibilities that maps the universe of stories.'
				- 'Within this triangle is the totality of writers' cosmologies, all their multitudinous visions of reality and how life is lived within it.'
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668406772347_0.png){:height 346, :width 404}
				- 'To understand your place in this universe, study the coordinates of this map, compare them to your work-in-progress, and let them guide you to that point you share with other writers of a similar vision.'
				-
				- 'At the top of the story triangle are the principles that constitute *Classical Design*.'
				- 'These principles are 'classical' to the truest sense: timeless and transcultural, fundamental  to every earthly society, civilized and primitive, reaching back through millennia of oral storytelling into the shadows of time.'
				- > *CLASSICAL DESIGN means a story built around an active protagonist who struggles against primarily external forces of antagonism to pursue his or her desire, through continuous time, within a consistent and causally connected fictional reality, to a closed ending of absolute irreversible change.*
				- 'This collection of timeless principles I call the Archplot: Arch in the dictionary sense of 'eminent above others of the same kind.''
				- 'CLASSICAL DESIGN - Archplot'
					- 'Causality'
					- 'Closed Ending'
					- 'Linear Time'
					- 'External Conflict'
					- 'Single Protagonist'
					- 'Consistent Reality'
					- 'Active Protagonist'
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668406869138_0.png){:height 232, :width 191}
				- 'The Archplot, however, is not the limit of storytelling shapes.'
				- 'Minimalism means that the writer begins with the elements of Classical Design but then reduces them--shrinking or compressing, trimming or truncating the prominent features of the Archplot.'
				- 'I call this set of minimalist variations *Miniplot*.'
				- 'Miniplot does not mean *no plot*, for its story must be as beautifully executed as an Archplot.'
				- 'Minimalism strives for simplicity and economy while retaining enough of the classical that the film will still satisfy the audience.'
				- 'MINIMALISM - Miniplot'
					- 'Open Ending'
					- 'Internal Conflict'
					- 'Multi-Protagonists'
					- 'Passive Protagonist'
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668406911332_0.png){:height 181, :width 205}
				- '*Antiplot*, the cinema counterpart to the antinovel or Nouveau Roman and Theatre of the Absurd.'
				- 'This set of antistructure variations doesn't reduce the Classical but reverses it, contradicting traditional forms to exploit, perhaps ridicule the very idea of formal principles.'
				- 'ANTI-STRUCTURE - Antiplot'
					- 'Coincidence'
					- 'Nonlinear Time'
					- 'Inconsistent Realities'
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668407137931_0.png){:height 165, :width 224}
				-
				- 'The Archplot is the meat, potatoes, pasta, rice, and couscous of world cinema.'
		- ### FORMAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE STORY TRIANGLE
			- #### Closed Versus Open Endings
				- 'The Archplot delivers a closed ending--all questions raised by he story are answered; all emotions evoked are satisfied.'
				- 'Miniplot, on the other hand, often leaves the ending somewhat open.'
				- 'Most of the questions raised by the telling are answered, but an unanswered question or two may trail out of the film, leaving the audience to supply it subsequent to the viewing.'
				- 'The question must be answerable, the emotion resolvable.'
				- 'All that has gone before leads to clear and limited alternatives that make a degree of closure possible.'
				- > *A Story Climax of absolute, irreversible change that answers all questions raised by the telling and satisfies all audience emotion is a CLOSED ENDING.*
				- > 'A Story Climax that leaves a question or two unanswered and some emotion unfulfilled is an OPEN ENDING.'
			- #### External Versus Internal Conflict
				- 'The Archplot puts emphasis on external conflict.'
				- 'The emphasis falls on their struggles with personal relationships, with social institutions, or with forces in the physical world.'
				- 'In Miniplot the protagonist may have strong external conflicts with family, society, and environment, but emphasis will fall on the battles within his own thoughts and feelings, conscious or unconscious.'
			- #### Single Versus Multiple Protagonists
				- 'The classically told story usually places a single protagonist--man, woman, or child--at the heart of the telling'
				- 'One major story dominates screentime and its protagonist is the star role.'
				- 'If the writer splinters the film into a number of relatively small, subplot-sized stories, each with a separate protagonist, the result minimalizes the roller-coaster dynamic of the Archplot and creates a variation of Multiplot variation of the Miniplot.'
			- #### Active Versus Passive Protagonist
				- The single protagonist of an Archplot tends to be active and dynamic, willfully pursuing desire through ever-escalating conflict and change.'
				- 'The protagonist of a Miniplot design, although not inert, is relatively reactive and passive.'
				- 'This passivity is compensated for either by giving the protagonist a powerful inner struggle or by surrounding him with dramatic events as in the Multiplot design.'
				- > *An ACTIVE PROTAGONIST, in the pursuit of desire, takes action in direct conflict with the people and the world around him.*
				- > *A PASSIVE PROTAGONIST is outwardly inactive while pursuing desire inwardly, in conflict with aspects of his or her own nature.*
			- #### Linear Versus Nonlinear Time
				- 'An Archplot begins at a certain point in time, moves elliptically through more or less continuous time, and ends at a later date.'
				- 'If flashbacks are used, they are handled so that the audience can place the story's events in their temporal order.'
				- 'An Antiplot is disjunctive, scrambling or fragmenting time to make it difficult, if not impossible to sort what happened into any linear sequence.'
				- 'Godard remarked that in his aesthetic a film must have a beginning, middle, and end...but not necessarily in that order.'
				- > *A story with or without flashbacks and arranged into a temporal order of events that the audience can follow is told in LINEAR TIME.*
				- > *A story that either skips helter-skelter through time or so blurs temporal continuity that the audience cannot sort out what happens before and after what is told in NONLINEAR TIME.
			- #### Causality Versus Coincidence
				- 'The Archplot stresses how things happen in the world, how a cause creates an effect, how this effect becomes a cause that triggers yet another effect.'
				- 'Classical story design charts the vast interconnectedness of life from the obvious to the impenetrable, from the intimate to the epic, from individual identity to the international infosphere.'
				- 'It lays bare the network of chain-linked causalities that, when understood, gives life meaning.'
				- 'The Antiplot, on the other hand, often substitutes coincidence for causality, putting emphasis on the random collisions of things in the universe that break the chains of causality and lead to fragmentation, meaninglessness, and absurdity.'
				- > *CAUSALITY drives a story in which motivated actions cause effects that in turn become the causes of yet other effects, thereby interlinking the various levels of conflict in a chain reaction of episodes to the Story Climax, expressing the interconnectedness of reality.*
				- > *COINCIDENCE drives a fictional world in which unmotivated actions trigger events that do not cause further effects, and therefore fragment the story into divergent episodes and an open ending, expressing the disconnectedness of existence.*
			- #### Consistent Versus Inconsistent Realities
				- 'An Archplot unfolds within a consistent reality but in this case doesn't mean actuality.'
				- 'Each fictional reality uniquely establishes how things happen within it.'
				- 'In an Archplot these rules cannot be broken--even if they are bizarre.'
				- > *CONSISTENT REALITIES are fictional settings that establish modes of interaction between characters and their world that are kept consistently throughout the telling to create meaning.*
				- 'All works in the *Fantasy* genre, for example, are Archplots in which whimsical rules of 'reality' are strictly obeyed.'
				- 'Having created story rules of causality, the writer of an Archplot must work within his self-created discipline.'
				- 'Consistent Reality, therefore, means an internally consistent world, true to itself.'
				- >*INCONSISTENT REALITIES are settings that mix modes of interaction so that the story's episodes jump inconsistently from one 'reality' to another to create a sense of absurdity.'*
				- 'In an Antiplot the only rule is to break the rules.'
				- 'Expressionism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Stream of Consciousness, Theatre of the Absurd, the antinovel, the cinematic antistructure may differ in technique but share the same result: a retreat inside the artist's private world to which the audience is admitted at the artist's discretion.'
				- 'The seven formal contradictions and contrasts listed above are not hard and fast.'
				- 'There are unlimited shades and degrees.'
				- 'All storytelling possibilities are distributed inside the story design triangle, but very few films are of such purity of form that they settle at its extreme corners.'
				- 'Each side of the triangle is a spectrum of structural choices, and writers slide their stories along these lines, blending or borrowing from each extreme.'
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668426096046_0.png){:height 362, :width 414}
			- #### Change Versus Stasis
				- 'Above the line drawn between Miniplot and Antiplot are stories in which life clearly changes.'
				- 'At the limits of Miniplot, however, change may be virtually invisible because it occurs at the deepest level of inner conflict.'
				- 'Below this line stories remain in stasis and do not arc.'
				- 'The value-charged condition of the character's life at the end of the film is virtually identical to that at the opening.'
				- 'Story dissolves into portraiture, either a portrait of verisimilitude or one of absurdity.'
				- 'I term these films *Nonplot.*
				- 'Although they inform us, touch us, and have their own rhetorical or formal structures, they do not tell story.'
				- 'Therefore, they fall outside the story triangle and into a realm that would include everything that could be loosely called 'narrative.'
				- 'Antistructured Nonplots also trace a circular pattern but turn it with absurdity and satire done in a supra-unnaturalistic style.'
		- ### THE POLITICS OF STORY DESIGN
			- 'In an ideal world art and politics would never touch.'
			- 'In reality they can't keep their hands off each other.'
			- 'So as in all things, politics lurks inside of the story triangle:'
				- 'The politics of taste,'
				- 'The politics of artistic versus commercial success.'
			- 'Americans are escapees from prisons of stagnant culture and rigid class who crave change.'
			- 'We change and change again, trying to find what, if anything, works.'
			- 'After weaving the trillion-dollar safety net of the Great Society, we're not shredding it.'
			- 'The Old World, on the other hand, has learned through centuries of hard experience to fear such change, that social transformations inevitably bring war, famine, chaos.'
			- 'The result is our polarized attitude toward story:'
				- 'The ingenuous optimism of Hollywood (not naïve about change but about its insistence on positive change) versus the equally ingenuous pessimism of the *art film* (not naïve about the human condition but about its insistence that it will never be other than negative or static).'
			- 'Minimalists overestimate the appetite of even the most self-absorbed minds for a diet of nothing but inner conflict.'
			- 'They also overestimate their talent to express the unseeable on screen.'
			- 'Hollywood's action filmmakers underestimate the interest of their audience in character, thought, and feeling, and, worse, overestimate their ability to avoid *Action* genre clichés.'
			- 'From story to story the writer may move anywhere within the triangle, but most of us feel more at home in one place or another.'
			- 'As you do, let me offer these points for you to weigh:'
				- #### The Writer Must Earn His Living Writing
					- 'Most human beings believe...'
						- 'that life brings closed experiences of absolute, irreversible change;'
						- 'their greatest sources of conflict are external to themselves;'
						- 'that they are the single and active protagonists of their own existence;'
						- 'that their existence operates through continuous time within a consistent, casually interconnected reality;'
						- 'and that inside this reality events happen for explainable and meaningful reasons.'
					- 'Classical design is a model of memory and anticipation.'
					- 'We collect and shape memories around an Archplot to bring back the past vividly.'
					- 'We mold our fantasies and hopes into an Archplot.'
					- 'Classical design displays the temporal, spatial, and causal patterns of human perception, outside which the mind rebels.'
					- 'The Archplot is neither ancient nor modern, Western nor Eastern; it is human.'
					- 'When the audience sense that  a story is drifting too close to fictional realities ti finds tedious or meaningless, it feels alienated and turns away.'
					- 'This is true of intelligent, sensitive people of all income and backgrounds.'
					- 'The vast majority of human beings cannot endorse the inconsistent realties of Antiplot, the internalized passivity of Miniplot, and the static circularity of Nonplot as metaphors for life as they live it.'
					- 'As the story reaches the bottom of the triangle the audience has shrunk to those loyal cinephile intellectuals who like to have their realities twisted once in a while.'
					- 'This is an enthusiastic, challenging audience...but a very small audience.'
					- 'If a Hollywood studio is going to take this wild ride with you, you must write a film that has at least a chance of recouping its huge risk.'
					- 'In other words, a film that leans toward the Archplot.'
				- #### The Writer Must Master Classical Form
					- 'The history of art is a history of revivals: Establishment icons are shattered by an avant-garde that in time becomes the new establishment to be attacked by a new avant-garde that uses its grandfather's for m of weapons.'
					- 'Rock'n'roll, which was named after black slang for sex, began as an avant-garde movement against the white-bread sounds of the postwar era.'
					- 'Now it's the definition of musical aristocracy and even used as church music.'
					- 'Respecting these cycles, great storytellers have always known that, regardless of background or education, everyone, consciously or instinctively, enters the story ritual with Classical anticipation.'
					- 'You'll know you understand it *when you can do it.*
					- 'The writer works at his skills until knowledge shifts from the left side of the brain to the right, until the intellectual awareness becomes living craft.'
				- #### The Writer Must Believe in What He Writes
					- 'Stanislavski asked his actors: Are you in love with the art in yourself or yourself in the art?'
					- 'You too must examine your motives for wanting to write the way you write.'
					- 'Each tale you create says to the audience: 'I believe life is like *this.*'
					- 'Every moment must be filled with your passionate conviction or we smell a phony.'
					- 'The young are taught that Hollywood and art are antithetical.'
					- 'A story is the embodiment of our ideas and passions in Edmund Husserl's phrase, 'an objective correlative' for the feelings and insights we wish to instill in the audience.'
					- 'When you work with one eye on your script and the other on Hollywood, making eccentric choices to avoid the taint of commercialism, you produce the literary equivalent of a temper tantrum.'
					- 'Angry contradiction of the patriarch is not creativity; it's delinquency calling for attention.'
					- 'Write only what you believe.'

	- ## 3 STRUCTURE AND SETTING
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### THE WAR ON CLICHé
			- 'This may be the most demanding time in history to be a writer'
			- 'By the time modern filmgoers sit down to your work, they've absorbed tens of thousands of hours of TV, movies, prose, and theatre.'
			- 'Cliché is at the root of audience dissatisfaction, and like a plague spread through ignorance, it now infects all story media.'
			- 'The cause of this worldwide epidemic is simple and clear; the source of all clichés can be traced to one thing and one thing alone: *The writer does not know the world if his story.*
			- 'Such writers select a setting and launch a screenplay assuming a knowledge of their fictional world that they don't have.'
			- 'Knowledge of and insight into the world of your story is fundamental to the achievement of originality and excellence.'
		- ### SETTING
			- > **A story's SETTING is four-dimensional**--*Period, Duration, Location, and Level of Conflict.*
			-
			- 'The first dimension of time is Period.'
			- 'Is the story set in the contemporary world? In history? A hypothetical future?
			- 'Or is it that rare fantasy which location in time is unknowable and irrelevant?'
				- > **PERIOD is a story's place in time.**
			- 'Duration is the second dimension of time.'
				- > **DURATION is the story's length through time.**
			- 'Location is the story's physical dimension.
			- 'What is the story's specific geography? In what town? On what streets? etc.'
				- > **LOCATION is a story's place in space.**
			- 'Level of Conflict is the human dimension.'
			- 'The cast of characters, containing its various levels of conflict, is part of a story's setting.'
			- 'Does your story focus on the inner, even unconscious conflicts within your characters?'
			- 'Or coming up a level, on personal conflicts?'
			- 'Or higher and wider, on battles with institutions in society?'
			- 'Wider still, on struggles against forces of the environment?'
			- 'Your story may be set at any one or any combination of these levels.'
				- > **LEVEL OF CONFLICT is the story's position on the hierarchy of human struggles.**
			- #### The Relationship Between Structure and Setting
				- 'A story's setting sharply defines and confines its possibilities.'
				- 'Within any world, no matter how imaginary, only certain events are possible or probable.'
				- > **A STORY must obey its own internal laws of probability. The event choices of the writer, therefore, are limited to the possibilities and probabilities within the world he creates.**
				- 'Each fiction world creates a unique cosmology and makes its own 'rules' for how and why things happen within it.'
				- 'Stories do not materialize from a void but grow out of materials in history and human experience.'
				- 'Once the audience grasps the laws of your reality, they feel violated if you break them and rejects your work as illogical and unconvincing.'
				- 'Seen this way, the setting may feel like a straitjacket to the imagination.'
				- 'There is no such thing as a portable story.'
				- 'An honest story is at home in one, and only one, place in time.'
			-
		- ### THE PRINCIPLE OF CREATIVE LIMITATION
			- 'Limitation is vital. The first step towards a well-told story is to create a small, *knowable* world.'
			- 'The constraint that setting imposes on story design doesn't inhibit creativity; it inspires it.'
			- 'All fine stories take place within a limited, knowable world.'
			- 'DR. STRANGELOVE is set in the office of General Jack D. Ripper, a B-52 Bomber heading for Russia, and the War Room of the Pentagon.'
			- 'It climaxes in planetary nuclear annihilation, but the telling is limited to three sets and eight principal characters.'
			- 'The world of a story must be small enough that the mind of a single artist can surround the fictional universe it creates and come to know it in the same depth and detail that God knows the one He created.'
			- By the time you finish your last draft, you must possess a commanding knowledge of your setting in such depth and detail that no one could raise a question about your world-from the eating habits of your characters to the weather in September--that you couldn't answer instantly.'
			- 'A 'small' world, however, does not mean a trivial world.'
			- 'Small,' in this case, means knowable.'
			- 'Commanding knowledge,' does not mean an extended awareness into every crevice of existence. It means knowledge of all that's germane.'
			- 'A limited world and restricted cast offer the possibility of knowledge in depth and bredth.'
			- >*The irony of setting versus story is this: The larger the world, the more diluted the knowledge of the writer, therefore the fewer his creative choices and the more cliched the story. The smaller the world, the more complete the knowledge of the writer, therefore the greater his creative choices. Result: a full original story and victory in the world on cliché.'*
		- ### RESEARCH
			- The key to winning this war is research, taking the time and effort to acquire knowledge.'
			- 'I suggest these specific methods: research of memory, research of imagination, research of fact.'
			- 'Generally, a story needs all three.'
			- #### Memory
				- 'Lean back from your desk and ask, 'What do I know from personal experience that touches my characters' lives?'
				- 'In your head it's only memory, but written down it becomes working knowledge.'
			- #### Imagination
				- 'Lean back and ask, 'What would it be like to live my character's life hour by hour, day by day?'
				- 'In vivid detail sketch how your characters shop, make love,  pray-scenes that may or may not find their way into your story, but drew you into your imagined world until it feels like deja vu.'
				- 'While memory gives us whole chunks of life, imagination takes fragments, slivers of dream, and chips of experience that seem unrelated, then seeks their hidden connections and merges them into a whole.'
				- 'Having found these links and envisioned the scenes, write them down.'
				- 'A working imagination is research.'
			- #### 'Fact'
				- 'Have you ever had writer's block?'
				- 'You're blocked because you have nothing to say.'
				- 'Research not only wins the war on cliché, it's the key to victory over fear and its cousin, depression.'
				- 'Research from memory, imagination, and fact is often followed by a phenomenon that authors love to describe in mythical terms.'
				- 'While research provides material, it's no substitute for creativity.'
				- A story is not an accumulation of information strung into a narrative, but a design of events to carry us to a meaningful climax.'
				- 'What's more, research must not become procrastination. Too many insecure talents spend years in study and never actually write anything.'
				- 'We do not first fill notebooks full of social biographical, and historical studies, and once all this work is done, begin to compose a story.'
				- 'Creativity is rarely so rational. Origination and exploration go on alternatively.'
				- 'As new ideas seed your story, story and characters grow; as your story grows, questions are raised and it hungers for more research.'
				- 'Creation and investigation go back and fourth, making demands on each other, pushing and pulling this way or that until the story shakes itself out, complete and alive.'
		- ### CREATIVE CHOICES
			- Fine writing is never one to one, never a matter of devising the exact number of events necessary to fill a story, then penciling in dialogue.'
			- 'When actors compliment each other, for example, they often say, 'I like your choices.' They know that if a colleague has arrived at a beautiful moment, it's because in rehearsal the actor tried it twenty different ways, then chose one perfect moment. The same is true for us.'
			- > **CREATIVITY means creative choices of inclusion and exclusion**
			- 'If you know the craft, you know how to cure clichés: Sketch ten different ways two high-school lovers meet.
			- 'True inspiration comes from a deeper source, so let loose your imagination.'
			- 'You needn't write out these scenes in full. You're on a search for ideas, so simply sketch the broad strokes of what happens.'
			- 'Once you've exhausted your best ideas, survey your list, asking these questions:'
				- 'Which scene is truest to my characters?'
				- 'Truest to their world?'
				- '*And has never been on the screen quite this way before?*'
				- 'This is the one you write into the screenplay.'
			- 'If your scene is cliche, but your instinct tells you its *the one*, start a new list.
			- 'A dozen different ways two high-school lovers meet by having adjacent lockers.'
			- 'Research this world, hang out, observe the crows, get involved, until you know the high-school locker scene like no writer before you.' *Ok so, this is fiction, so arguably you wouldn't want this 'research' to be at an actual high-school.*
			- 'Scanning your new list you ask the same questions as before.'
			- 'If your finished screenplay contains every scene you've ever written, if you've never thrown an idea away,  if your rewriting is little more than tinkering with dialogue, your work will almost certainly fail.'
			- 'If, however, research inspires a pace of ten to one, even twenty to one, and if you then make brilliant choices to find that 10 percent of excellence and burn the rest, every scene will fascinate and the world will sit in awe of your genius.'
			- 'No one has to see your failures unless you add vanity to folly and exhibit them.'
			- 'Genius consists not only of the power to create expressive beats and scenes, but of the taste, judgement, and will to weed out and destroy banalities, conceits, false notes, and lies.'
	- ## 4 STRUCTURE AND GENRE
		- ### THE FILM GENRES
		  collapsed:: true
			- 'Through tens of thousands of years told at fireside, four millennia of the written word, twenty-five hundred years of theatre, a century of film, and eight decades of broadcasting, countless generations of storytellers have spun story into an astonishing diversity of patterns.'
			- 'To make sense of this outpouring, various systems have been devised to sort stories according to shared elements, classifying them by *genre.*'
			- 'No two systems, however, have ever agreed on which story elements to use in the sorting, and, therefore, no two agree on the number and kind of genres.'
			- 'Aristotle gave us the first genres by dividing dramas according to the value-change of their ending versus their story design.'
			- 'The result is his four basic genres: Simple Tragic, Simple Fortunate, Complex Tragic, Complex Fortunate.'
			- 'While scholars dispute definition sand systems, the audience is already a genre expert.'
			- 'This two-handed trick is impossible without a knowledge of genre that surpasses the audience's.'
			- 'Below is the genre and subgenre system used by screen-writers--a system that's evolved from practice, not theory, and that turns on differences of subject, setting, role, event, and values.'
				- 1. **LOVE STORY.** Its subgenre, **Buddy Salvation**, substitutes friendship for romantic love.
				- 2. **HORROR FILM.** This genre divides into three subgenres: the **Uncanny,** in which the source of horror is astounding but subject to 'rational' explanation, such as beings from outer space, science-made monsters, or a maniac; the **Supernatural,** in which the source of horrid an 'irrational' phenomenon from the spirit realm; and the **Super-Uncanny,** in which the audience is kept guessing between the other two possibilities.
				- 3. **MODERN EPIC** (the individual versus the state).
				- id:: 6376f717-4c2f-414e-ad09-0ac0c3728538
				  4. **WESTERN.** The evolution of the genre and its subgenres is brilliantly tranced in Will Wright's *Six Guns and Society*
				- 5. **WAR GENRE.** Although war is often the setting for another genre, such as the **Love Story,** the **WAR GENRE** is specifically about combat. **Pro-War** versus **Antiwar** are its primary subgenres. Contemporary films generally oppose war, but for decades the majority covertly glorified it, even in its most grisly form.
				- 6. **MATURATION PLOT.** or the coming-of-age story.
				- 7. **REDEMPTION PLOT.** Here the film arcs on a moral change within the protagonist from bad to good.
				- 8. **PUNITIVE PLOT.** In these the good guy turns bad and is punished.
				- 9. **TESTING PLOT.** Stories of willpower versus temptation to surrender.
				- 10. **EDUCATION PLOT.** This genre arcs on a deep change within the protagonist's view of life, people, or self rom the negative (naive, distrustful, fatalistic, self-hating) to the positive (wise, trusting, optimistic, self-possessed).
				- 11. **DISILLUSIONMENT PLOT.** A deep change of worldview from the positive to the negative.
				- 12. **COMEDY.** Subgenres range from **Parody** to **Satire** to **Sitcom** to **Romantic** to **Screwball** to **Farce** to **Black Comedy**, all differing by the focus of comic attack (bureaucratic folly, upper-class-manners, teenage courtship, etc.) and the degree of ridicule (gentle, caustic, lethal).
				- 13. **CRIME.** Subgenres vary chiefly by the answer to this question: From whose point of view do we regard the crime? **Murder Mystery** (master detective's POV); **Caper** (master criminal's POV); **Detective** (cop's POV); **Gangster** (crook's POV); **Thriller** or **Revenge Tale** (victim's POV); **Courtroom** (lawyer's POV); **Prison Drama** (inmate's POV); **Espionage** (spy's POV); **Newspaper** (reporter's POV); **Film Noir**(POV of a protagonist who may be part criminal, part detective, part victim of a femme fatale.)
				- 14. **SOCIAL DRAMA.** This genre identifies problems in society--poverty, the education system, communicable diseases, the disadvantaged, antisocial rebellion, and the like--then constructs a story demonstrating a cure. It has a number of sharply focused subgenres: **Domestic Drama** (problems within the family), the **Woman's Film** (dilemmas such as career versus family, lover versus children), **Political Drama** (corruption in politics), **Eco-Drama** (battles to save the environment), **Medical Drama** (struggles with physical illness), and **Psycho-Drama** (struggles with mental illness).
				- 15. **ACTION/ADVENTURE.** This often borrows aspects from other genres such as **War** or **Political Drama** to use as motivation for explosive action and derring-do. If **ACTION/ADVENTURE** incorporates ideas such as destiny, hubris, or the spiritual, it becomes the subgenre **High Adventure.** If Mother Nature is the source of antagonism, it's a **Disaster/Survival Film.**
			- Taking a still wider view, supra-genres are created out of settings, performance styles, or filmmaking techniques that contain a host of autonomous genres.
			- They are like mansions of many rooms where one of the basic genres, subgenres, or any combination might find a home:
				- 16. **HISTORICAL DRAMA.** History is an inexhaustible source of story material and embraces every type of story imaginable. The treasure chest of history, however, is sealed with this warning: What is past must be present. A screenwriter must find an audience today. Therefore, the best use of history, and the only legitimate excuse to set a film in the past and thereby add untold millions to the budget, is anachronism--to use the past as a clear glass through which  you show us the present.
			- Many contemporary antagonisms are so distressing or loaded with controversy that it's difficult to dramatize them in a present-day setting without alienating the audience. Such dilemmas are often best viewed at a safe distance in time. **HISTORICAL DRAMA** polishes the past into a mirror of the present, making clear and bearable the painful problems of racism, religious strife, or violence of all kinds, especially against women.
			- Despite an antiquated setting, within minutes an audience can feel immediately at home with corrupted aristocrats--they are us.
				- 17.**BIOGRAPHY.** This cousin to **Historical Drama** focuses on a person rather than an era. **BIOGRAPHY,** however, must never become a simple chronicle. The biographer must interpret facts as if they were fiction, find meaning of the subject's life, then cast him as the protagonist of his life's genre.
			- These caveats apply equally to the subgenre **Autobiography.**
			- For while it's true that the unexamined life is not worth living, it's also the case that the unlived life isn't worth examining.
				- 18. **DOCU-DRAMA.** A second cousin to **Historical Drama,** **DOCU-DRAMA** centers on recent rather than past events.
				- 19. **MOCKUMENTARY.** This genre pretends to be rooted in actuality or memory, behaves like documentary or autobiography, but is utter fiction. It subverts fact-based filmmaking to satirize hypocritical institutions: the backstage world of rock'n'roll, the Catholic Church; middle-class mores; journalism; politics; and crass American values.
				- 20. **MUSICAL.** Descended from opera, this genre presents a 'reality' in which characters sing and dance their stories. it's often a **Love Story, ** but it can be **Film Noir**; **Social Drama;** **Punitive Plot**; **Biography**. Any genre can work in musical form and all can be satirized in **Musical Comedy.**
				- 21. **SCIENCE FICTION.** In hypthetical futures that are typically technological dystopias of tyranny and chaos, the **SCIENCE FICTION** writer often marries the man-against-state **Modern Epic** with **Action/Adventure.** But, like history, the future is a setting in which any genre may play. Andrei Tarkovsky used sci-fi to act out the inner conflicts of a **Disillusionment Plot.**
				- 22. **SPORTS GENRE.** Sport is a crucible for character change. This genre is a natural home for the **Maturation Plot;** the **Redemption Plot;** the **Education Plot;** the **Punitive Plot;** the **Testing Plot;** the **Disillusionment Plot;** the **Buddy Salvation;** or **Social Drama.**
				- 23. **FANTASY.** Here the writer plays with time, space, and the physical, bending and mixing the laws of nature and the supernatural. The extra-realities of **FANTASY** attract the **Action** genres but also welcome others such as the **Love Story;** **Political Drama/Allegory;** **Social Drama;** or **Maturation Plot.**
				- 24. **ANIMATION.** Here the law of universal metamorphism rules: Anything can become something else. Like **Fantasy** and **Science Fiction,** **ANIMATION** leans toward the **Action** genres of cartoon **Farce;** or **High Adventure;** **Maturation Plots**; but as the animators of Eastern Europe and Japan have shown, there are no restraints.
			- Lastly, for those who believe that genres and their conventions are concerns of 'commercial' writers only, and that series art is nongenetic, let me add one last name to the list:
				- 25. **ART FILM.** The avant-garde notion of writing outside the genres is naïve. No one writes in a vacuum. The **ART FILM** has become a traditional genre, divisible into two subgenres **Minimalism** and **Antistructuralism,** each with its own complex of formal conventions of structure and cosmology. Like **Historical Drama**, the **ART FILM** is a supra-genre that embraces other basic genres: **Love Story, Political Drama,** and the like.
			- Although this slate is reasonably comprehensive, no list cna ever be definitive or exhaustive because the lines between genres often overlap as they influence and merge with one another.
			- Each writer's homework is first to identify his genre, then research its governing practices.
			- There is no escaping these tasks.
			- We're all genre writers.
			-

		- ### THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRUCTURE AND GENRE
			-
