				- When will we have begun? Where – or when – does a literary text begin? This question raises a series of fundamental problems in literary criticism and theory. Does a text begin as the author puts his or her ﬁrst mark on a piece of paper or keys in the ﬁrst word on a computer? Does it begin with the ﬁrst idea about a story or poem, or in the childhood of the writer, for instance? Or does the text only begin as the reader picks up the book? Does the text begin with its title, or with the ﬁrst word of the so-called ‘body’ of the text? 
				  This extraordinary opening sentence is all about beginnings. Thematically, it establishes the poem to be about the ﬁrst disobedience of Adam and Eve which ‘Brought death into the world, and all our woe’. But it is also about itself as a beginning: it assures us that this is the ﬁrst time that such a project has been attempted (‘Things unattempt yet in prose or rhyme’). It is as if the opening to a poem could be the equivalent of a moon-landing – one small step for John Milton ...Rather differently, the opening sentence is about itself as a beginning in the sense that it is asking the ‘Heavenly Muse’ for inspiration. It is about the way that poems are conventionally thought to begin – in inspiration. This produces a strange paradox of beginnings: the origin of the poem, inspiration, comes after the beginning of the poem. In other ways, too, Milton’s opening unsettles any simple notion of opening or beginning. Not only does the poem talk about a beginning (the eating of the fruit of know-ledge) but it also refers to a future return to a time before that beginning (‘regain the blissful seat’), a restoration which will be both the beginning of a new age and a repetition of a previous state.
				  There is another way in which this beginning is not a beginning: it repeatedly refers us back to other texts. Milton refers to Moses (‘That shepherd’) in the belief that he ‘taught’ the children of Israel the creation story – in other words, that he wrote the opening books of the Old Testament. In this respect, the muse that Milton’s poem addresses and invokes is a second-hand muse. Contrary to its claims to originality, this opening echoes and alludes to various other openings. ‘Of man’s ﬁrst disobedience . . . Sing Heavenly Muse’ repeats the conventional apostrophe of such classical openings as Homer’s Iliad and Virgil’s Aeneid; ‘In the beginning’ repeats the opening to the Gospel according to St John (‘In the beginning was the Word’), and so on. Finally, the very syntax of Milton’s sentence displaces the beginning of the poem, in particular by holding back the main verb of the sentence – ‘Sing’ – until line six.

				- Despite the complications of Milton’s opening, however, at least it tries (or pretends to try) to begin at the beginning, rather than in the middle. Beginning in the middle – in medias res – is the other way to begin. One of the most famous beginnings-in-the-middle is Dante’s opening to The Divine Comedy (c. 1307–20): There are at least three different middles here: the middle of ‘our life’, the middle of a dark wood, the middle of a narrative. Dante conﬂates life, journey and narrative, and suggests the uncanny terror of beginning at such a moment of middling. In particular, the uncanniness of ‘mi ritrovai’ suggests the hallucinatory terror of (re-)ﬁnding, of retrieving oneself. But Dante’s opening might also suggest that there are no absolute beginnings – only strange originary middles. No journey, no life, no narrative ever really begins: all have in some sense already begun before they begin. But this is not to say that we can do without the concept of the beginning. Where would we be without a beginning? Where would a text be?
				  The paradox of the beginning having already begun is wittily presented by Laurence Sterne in the opening of his novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759) in terms of both the beginning of a narrative and the beginning of a life:
				  This opening is a comic version of Philip Larkin’s equivocal opening line to his poem ‘This Be The Verse’ (1974): ‘They fuck you up, your mum and dad’. Tristram Shandy complains because his parents were thinking of something else at the moment of his conception and he is afraid that in consequence his whole life has been fucked up. As his uncle Toby remarks a few pages later, ‘My Tristram’s misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the world’ (7). Tristram Shandy famously confronts the intractable problem of how to end an autobiography: such a text can never catch up with itself because it takes longer to write about life than it takes to live it. In this sense, no autobiography can ever end. But Tristram Shandy is also about how to begin – how to begin at the beginning – and how we begin.

				- If beginnings always have a context and are therefore determined by what comes before, the opening to Tristram Shandy also makes it clear that, in turn, beginnings determine what comes after. This is true of literary as of other beginnings: beginnings augur, acting like promises for what is to come. Such is the force of many well-known literary beginnings. The opening to Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice (1813) is apparently unequivocal: ‘It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife’ (1). This sets the stage for the whole novel. The topic is marriage, the tone is ironic. Austen proclaims the values of universalism (‘a truth universally acknowledged’), while satirizing them: what is acknowledged as a truth for upper middle-class men in early nineteenth-century England is not necessarily acknowledged un iversally. Before going on to pro-vide an ‘Explanatory’ note on its dialect, Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer’s Comrade) (1885) begins with a ‘notice’:
				  At once witty and bafﬂing, the sentence is both an entrance and a barrier to the novel. It reads something like the sentence ‘Do not read this sentence’, in that it both acknowledges that readers do try to ﬁnd motives and morals in narratives, and comically prohibits such a reading. Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick; or, The Whale (1851) is also framed by a number of what Gérard Genette calls ‘peritexts’ (Genette 1987) – by a contents page, a dedication, an ‘Etymology’ (of the word ‘Whale’) and ‘Extracts’ (several pages of quotations about whales) – before it begins with the famous words ‘Call me Ishmael’. Satirical prevarication and pedantry, combined with blustering assertiveness, characterize the whole novel. Virginia Woolf ’s Orlando (1928) opens (after a dedication, preface, contents page and list of illustrations) with a sentence that equivocates by appearing not to do so: ‘He – for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it – was in the act of slicing at the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters’ (13). The sentence begins a book about a person of uncertain or variable gender in a tone of strange uncertainty, with a suggestive mixture of decapitation and castration. By appearing not to, this opening sentence, like the novel as a whole, subtly undermines conventional ideas about gender identity. The ﬁrst sentence of Ford Madox Ford’s The Good Soldier (1915) is sheer heart-tugging seduction: ‘This is the saddest story I have ever heard’ (7). It is the sort of sentence from which a novel might never recover. And Proust’s famous under-stated opening to Remembrance of Things Past (1913–27) implies that there is no single beginning: ‘Longtemps, je me suis couché de bonne heure’ (‘For a long time I used to go to bed early’, 13). A studied reﬂection on the past, a sense of intimacy, the power of habit and repetition are what characterize Proust’s 3,000-page novel. As these examples suggest, one of the peculiarities of literary openings is that they are never single. The openings to Huckleberry Finn, Moby-Dick and Orlando produce multiple beginnings through their ‘peritexts’, but the other examples also present more than one beginning: The Good Soldier suggests both a story and its retelling (as well as other stories that are not as sad), while Proust’s opening gives a sense that narrative begins in repetition, that no single event can be said to be a beginning.

				- As we have begun to see, one of the ways in which a literary text multi-plies its beginning is through the deployment of peritexts – titles, subtitles, dedications, epigraphs, introductions, ‘notices’ and so on. A classic example would be the opening of T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land (1922). Before we arrive at the ﬁrst words of Eliot’s poem we encounter a series of multilingual hurdles. To start with, there is the title. The title, like all titles, is uncertainly poised between inside and outside. It both names the poem, as if from outside, and forms part of that poem. ‘The Waste Land’ both refers to a place or predicament – post-1918 Europe, for example – and names the strange ‘land’ that Eliot’s poem creates (like a waste land, the poem is full of debris from the past, fragmentary memories and quotations). Next we encounter the Latin and Greek of Petronius: ‘Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi in ampulla pendere, et cum illi pueri dicerent: ΣCβυλλα τC Θελεις; respondebat illa: Aποθαυειυ ΘBλω’ (‘For once I myself saw with my own eyes the Sibyl at Cumae hanging in a cage, and when the boys said to her “Sibyl, what do you want?” she replied, “I want to die” ’). As an epigraph, this quotation too may be said to be both inside and outside the poem, both a commentary on and a part of the text. The next hurdle is a tribute in Italian to Ezra Pound: ‘il miglior fabbro’ (‘the better craftsman’). Pound, as editor, was responsible for much of the ﬁnal shape of Eliot’s poem and therefore is in part the crafts-man of what follows. Even this tribute is a quotation: it comes from Dante’s Purgatorio and is in this sense too both part of Eliot’s poem and not part of it. Finally, there is a subtitle: ‘1. The Burial of the Dead’. This is a quotation from the Anglican burial service. Then we have what appear to be the ﬁrst words of the poem:
				  In these and other ways, Eliot’s poem displaces its own beginning. The beginning of the poem is no longer the ﬁrst stroke of the pen or keyboard. Through emphatic effects of intertextuality (including quotation, allusion, reference and echo), Eliot’s poem suggests that originality, the notion of beginning as singular, deﬁnable, stable is severely problematic. To ask where or when Eliot’s poem begins is to meet with a series of questions concerning the identity of the author, the text and reader, and ﬁnally of the Western literary tradition generally.

				- Dante's Purgatorio
					- The beginning of Dante's Purgatorio is significant for several literary reasons.
					- The first and most obvious is the continuation of the narrative from the previous work, Inferno, as the protagonist, Dante, and his guide, Virgil, move from the depths of Hell to the mountain of Purgatory.
					- This ==transition== from the ==darkness and suffering== of Hell to the more ==hopeful and redemptive== space of Purgatory is significant in its ==symbolism and contrast==.
					- The beginning of Purgatorio is also significant for its use of language and poetic devices.
					- Dante's use of ==terza rima==, a three-line stanza form with a==complex rhyme scheme== , creates a sense of ==forward momentum and movement==, mirroring the physical journey of the characters.
					- Additionally, Dante's use of imagery, such as the sunrise and the celestial spheres, adds to the sense of hope and renewal that permeates the beginning of Purgatorio.
					- Another literary significance of the beginning of Purgatorio is its focus on the theme of ==free will and personal responsibility==.
					- The souls in Purgatory are there to atone for their sins and prepare themselves for their ultimate redemption, but they are also actively working to better themselves and exercise their free will.
					- This emphasis on ==individual responsibility and the possibility of redemption== through personal effort is a key theme in Dante's work and a significant contribution to the literary tradition.

				- The Waste Land may seem to be unusually concerned with questions of origins and their displacement. But the kinds of effects of intertextuality that this opening explores are in fact fundamental to literary texts more generally. Literary texts, that is to say, are always constructed by and within a context or tradition. In his well-known essay ‘Tradition and the Individual Talent’ (1919), Eliot himself argues that ‘No poet, no artist of any art, has his [sic] complete meaning alone’: rather, what is important is the poet’s ‘relation to the dead poets and artists’ (Eliot 1975, 38). A poem, novel or play that does not in some sense relate to previous texts is, in fact, literally unimaginable. The author of such a text would have to invent everything. It would be like inventing a new language from scratch, without any reliance on already existing languages. In this sense, intertextuality (the displacement of origins to other texts, which are in turn displacements of other texts and so on – in other words, an undoing of the very idea of pure or straightforward origins) is fundamental to the institution of literature. No text makes sense without other texts. Every text is what Roland Barthes calls ‘a new tissue of past citations’ (Barthes 1981, 39).
			- [[#blue]]==1.5.2==
				- The opening of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land exemplifies how literary texts are always constructed within a ==context== or ==tradition==, and how they are fundamentally ==intertextual==.

				- The ==displacement of origins== to other texts is a key aspect of intertextuality, and is necessary for a text to make sense.
				- Eliot argued that the relationship between a poet and previous poets is important for creating meaning.
				- In fact, a text that does not relate to previous texts is unimaginable, like inventing a new language from scratch.

				- Eliot employs a range of literary techniques to illustrate the intertextuality of literary texts.
				- For instance, his use of allusion serves to enrich the meaning of the poem and provide insight into the themes and motifs that Eliot is exploring.
				- The poem is filled with references to a wide range of literary and cultural sources, such as ==Shakespeare==, Dante, and ==Hindu mythology==, which contributes to the complexity of the work and its significance.
				- Another technique that Eliot uses to highlight the intertextuality of literature is fragmentation and ==juxtaposition==.
				- "The Waste Land" is composed of a series of ==disconnected fragments and images==, which are woven together through ==a complex web of associations and contrasts==.
				- This technique reflects the fragmentation and disorientation of modern society and is also an example of how literary movements like ==modernism== and ==surrealism== influenced Eliot's work.
				- Overall, "The Waste Land" is a masterful example of how literary texts are constructed within a context or tradition and are fundamentally intertextual.
				- Eliot's use of allusion and fragmentation and his integration of various literary and cultural sources serve to create a complex and layered work that reflects the complexity of the modern world.

				- Two of the most compelling and most persistent myths of literary texts concern their origins. The ﬁrst is the idea that the most important aspect of any reading is an imagined meeting of the reader’s mind with that of the author – an idea that exempliﬁes what has been known, since a famous essay of that name (1946 rev. 1954), as the ‘intentional fallacy’ (the mistaken belief that what the author intended is the ‘real’, ‘ﬁnal’ meaning of the work and that we can or should know what this is (see Wimsatt and Beardsley 1995)). But if we cannot know the beginnings of a text in terms of what is available to us on the page, how much more difﬁcult it would be to discover the origins of the thought which impels the text. Does an author know where these thoughts come from? Are they in fact thoughts (conscious, coherent, consistent)?Whose ‘thoughts’ do we read when we read the beginning of The Waste Land? Eliot’s, Chaucer’s, Pound’s, Petronius’, Dante’s? Are they still the poet’s thoughts if the poet is said to be ‘inspired’? The second common myth involves the priority given to an individual reader’s ﬁrst reading of a text. According to this myth, all literary criticism involves a corruption of the original ‘experience’ of reading. Once upon a time (so this myth goes) we were able to read a novel (by Charlotte Brontë, say, or J.K. Rowling) and have a completely unadulterated reading experience, unsullied by any critical thinking or complexity. But although we often talk about literary texts as though they have been subjected to only one reading, we all know that this is in many respects simply a convenient ﬁction. Roland Barthes, in his book S/Z (1970), makes a point about the act of rereading as ‘an operation contrary to the commercial and ideological habits of our society’ and suggests that it is ‘tolerated only in certain marginal categories of readers (children, old people and professors)’ (Barthes 1990b, 15–16).

				- This idea, exemplified by the "==intentional fallacy==," presupposes that the ==author's intended meaning== is the final meaning of the work.
				- However, we cannot know the origin of a text's meaning, let alone the origin of the thought that drives the text.
				- The second myth is the belief in the priority of the individual reader's first reading of a text.
				- This myth suggests that ==literary criticism== corrupts the original reading experience. However, this is a convenient fiction, and rereading is often necessary for ==critical thinking==.

				- Roland Barthes' S/Z
					- Roland Barthes' S/Z is a significant work of literary criticism that challenges ==traditional notions of literary interpretation==.
					- In S/Z, Barthes conducts a structural analysis of Balzac's short story "Sarrasine" by breaking down the text into small components and examining how they function within the story's overall structure.
					- The work is significant for its exploration of the concept of intertextuality and how ==meaning is created through the interplay of various elements== within a text.
					- Barthes also emphasizes==the role of the reader in the creation of meaning== , arguing that the ==meaning of a text is not fixed== and can vary depending on the reader's interpretation.

			- ==1.6.3.1.1==
				- Origins of literary texts
					- The origins of literary texts refer to the historical, social, and cultural contexts in which a particular work of literature was produced.
					- Understanding the origins of a literary text can be important to interpreting and analyzing its meaning.
				- Imagined meaning
					- Imagined meaning refers to the subjective interpretation of a literary text by a reader.
					- Readers often bring their own experiences, beliefs, and biases to their interpretation of a work, and the imagined meaning of a text can vary widely among different readers.
				- Reader's mind
					- The reader's mind refers to the mental processes and responses of the reader when engaging with a literary text.
					- This includes both conscious and unconscious responses to the text, as well as the reader's understanding and interpretation of the work.
				- Intentional fallacy
					- The intentional fallacy refers to the assumption that the author's intention is the primary determinant of a literary work's meaning.
					- This fallacy is based on the belief that the author's intention is always clear and that the meaning of a work can be derived solely from the author's intention.
				- Author's intended meaning
					- The author's intended meaning refers to the meaning that the author intended to convey through their work.
					- This can include themes, motifs, symbols, and other literary elements that the author consciously incorporated into their writing.
					- However, the intended meaning of a work is not always clear or easily discernible, and can be subject to interpretation and reinterpretation over time.
				- Literary criticism
					- Literary criticism refers to the analysis, interpretation, and evaluation of literary works.
					- It involves examining the literary techniques, themes, and meanings of a work, as well as its historical and cultural context.
					- Literary criticism can take many forms, including academic scholarship, book reviews, and online discussions.
				- Critical thinking
					- Critical thinking refers to the process of analyzing and evaluating information in order to form a judgment or make a decision.
					- In the context of literature, critical thinking involves examining the text, considering its themes and meanings, and questioning assumptions or biases that may affect the reader's interpretation of the work.
				- Rereading
					- Rereading refers to the act of reading a literary work more than once.
					- Rereading can be important for gaining a deeper understanding of a work, identifying new themes or meanings, and refining one's interpretation of the text.
				- Meaning
					- Meaning refers to the significance or purpose of a literary work.
					- This can include themes, motifs, symbols, and other literary elements that contribute to the overall message or impact of the work.
					- The meaning of a work can be subject to interpretation and can vary among different readers.
				- Role of the reader
					- The role of the reader refers to the importance of the reader in shaping the meaning and interpretation of a literary work.
					- Readers bring their own experiences, beliefs, and biases to their engagement with a text, and these factors can influence their understanding and interpretation of the work.
					- The reader's role is thus crucial to the creation of meaning in literature.
				- Traditional notions of literary interpretation
					- Traditional notions of literary interpretation refer to the approach of analyzing and interpreting a literary work based on its author's intentions and the objective meaning of the text.
					- This approach emphasizes the authority of the author in determining the meaning of the work and assumes that the meaning is fixed and objectively identifiable.
				- Meaning is created through the interplay of various elements
					- The meaning of a literary work is not solely determined by the author's intentions, but rather is created through the interplay of various elements within the text, including themes, motifs, symbols, and language.
					- The meaning can also be influenced by the historical and cultural context in which the work was produced.
				- The role of the reader in the creation of meaning
					- The role of the reader in the creation of meaning is central to contemporary literary theory. Readers are seen as active participants in the interpretation of a text, bringing their own experiences, perspectives, and cultural contexts to their engagement with the work.
					- The meaning of a text is thus not fixed, but is shaped by the reader's interpretation.
				- Meaning of a text is not fixed
					- The meaning of a literary text is not fixed, but rather is subject to interpretation and reinterpretation over time.
					- The meaning can change depending on the reader's perspective, the historical and cultural context in which the work is read, and the evolving interpretations of literary critics and scholars.
					- The meaning of a text is thus always open to multiple readings and interpretations.

				- Professors – who are usually old people, very seldom children, though not infrequently an undecidable mixture of the two – include Roland Barthes, of course, and it is part of his aim to question the very idea of a single or ﬁrst reading. Rereading, he argues, contests the claim which would have us believe that the ﬁrst reading is a primary, naïve, phenomenal reading which we will only, afterwards, have to ‘explicate’, to intellectualize (as if there were a beginning of reading, as if everything were not already read: there is no ﬁrst reading . . . ). (Barthes 1990b, 16)

				  Once again, Eliot’s The Waste Land suggests some of the complexities involved in a ﬁrst reading. If the opening to Eliot’s poem refers to Chaucer’s, then when can we properly be said to read ‘April is the cureless month’? Surely we must reread it, once we have read it, with Chaucer’s words in mind. In which case the ﬁrst reading is inadequate. Less dramatically, perhaps, the same may be said of any other literary text: every reading (even a so-called ‘ﬁrst reading’) is at least in part a learned or programmed response, conditioned by other and others’ readings. In this respect, reading critically is, in T.S. Eliot’s words, ‘as inevitable as breathing’ (Eliot 1975, 37).
				  The present book is, fundamentally, about questions of origins, about beginning. It is concerned with how we might begin to read, to think about and write about literary texts. In particular, the book is about those uncertain origins – the author, the reader and the text – none of which can ever be taken for granted. Neither author nor reader nor text ﬁnally or properly constitutes a beginning. As with ‘beginning literary studies’ (which we have begun now, haven’t we?), the idea that everything begins with the author or with the reader or with one particular text is both deeply compelling and deeply false.

				- Phenomenal reading
					- A phenomenal reading refers to a deeper, more interpretive engagement with a literary work.
					- This type of reading involves examining the language, symbols, themes, and other literary elements of the text to gain a deeper understanding of its meaning.
				- Programmed response
					- A programmed response refers to a predetermined or automatic reaction to a literary work.
					- This type of response may be based on preconceived notions or biases, and may prevent the reader from engaging fully with the text and discovering its deeper meanings.
				- Questions of origins
					- Questions of origins refer to the historical, social, and cultural context in which a literary work was produced.
					- Understanding the origins of a work can be important to interpreting its meaning and understanding the themes and motifs that the author is exploring.

				  more recent and perhaps more accessible book on beginnings is A.D. Nuttall’s
				  Openings (1992), which eschews theoretical discussion in favour of a concen-
				  trated focus on a small number of classic literary openings. On intertextuality,
				  see Graham Allen’s very readable Intertextuality(2000) and Mary Orr’s rather
				  more specialist Intertextuality (2003); and see Daniel Chandler’s chapter
				  on intertextuality in Semiotics: The Basics (2007), which is also available
				  online at www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem09.html. There has
				  been an enormous amount of work in recent years on questions of originality
				  and plagiarism in literature, much of it rather specialized, but see, in par-
				  ticular, Margaret Russett’s Fictions and Fakes (2006), Hillel Schwartz, The
				  Culture of the Copy (1996), and Françoise Meltzer, Hot Property (1994). For
				  a brilliant if sometimes polemically anti-theory approach to the question of
				  allusion, see Christopher Ricks, Allusion to the Poets (2002). On the origins
				  of creativity, see Timothy Clark’s difficult but inspirational book, The Theory

	- ### 2 Readers and Reading
	  collapsed:: true
		- **2.1**
		  collapsed:: true
			- In Percy Bysshe Shelley’s famous sonnet ‘Ozymandias’ (1818) the narrator speaks of meeting a traveler who reports having seen a vast shattered statue strewn across the desert. The statue is of Ozymandias, the thirteenth-century bc King Rameses II of Egypt (Ozymandias is the Greek name for this king). All that remains of the King of Kings and of his ‘works’ are a few broken fragments, a couple of legs and an inscription which commands the reader to despair. The poem, then, is about monuments, survival and the transience of even the greatest of us. But we might also notice that the poem is about readers and reading – the traveler reads a piece of writing, an inscription on the pedestal of a fragmented statue. The inscription commands the reader. And, rather differently, the word ‘read’ appears in line six, referring to the way that the sculptor understood the ‘passions’ of Ozymandias and was able to immortalize them in stone. Both the traveler and the sculptor are explicitly ﬁgured as readers, and we might also think about the ‘I’ of the ﬁrst line as another kind of reader –a listener to the traveler’s tale.
			  The poem, then, concerns a series of framed acts of reading. The sculptor reads the face of the king, the traveler reads the inscription, the narrative ‘I’ listens to the tale and, ﬁnally, we read the poem. One of the things that we might do with this poem is to think about these acts of reading. The poem can be thought about as what Paul de Man calls an ‘allegory of reading’ (de Man, 1979): it is not only a poem which can be read, it is also a poem about reading. One of the crucial questions of reading, for example, is how we can justify any particular reading: how can we tell if a particular reading or interpretation is valid? This is a question that goes to the heart of almost every debate in criticism and theory. In this respect the poem presents a paradox in that the traveler says that only a few fragments of the statue remain, that this is all that is left of Ozymandias and his great works. But if this is the case, how can the traveler know that the sculptor read the king’s passions ‘well’? In this way Shelley’s poem can be understood as telling a story or allegory about one of the central paradoxes of reading. To read ‘well’ is generally taken as meaning to read accurately or faithfully. But the question of which reading of a text is the most accurate is itself a question of reading.
		- 2.1.1
			- The poem "Ozymandias" by Percy Bysshe Shelley is about monuments, survival, and the transience of even the greatest of us.
			- It is also about readers and reading, as the sculptor, the traveler, and the narrator are all depicted as readers.
			- The poem can be seen as an allegory of reading, raising questions about how we can justify any particular reading and which reading is the most accurate.
			- The poem presents a paradox in that the traveler knows the sculptor read the king's passions well, but if only a few fragments of the statue remain, how can this be known?

			- ‘Ozymandias’, then, opens up a series of questions concerning readers and reading. In addition to the crucial question of how we can validate any reading (how we can know whether it is true or faithful), the poem also engages with other questions. Who is this traveler who reads the inscription, for example? And who is the ‘I’ who listens to, or ‘reads’, his story? Is the sculptor’s ‘mocking’ of the king’s face a kind of reading? What do such questions lead us to think about the power relations of any reading? Is it in the king’s power to command his readers to despair? Or to make them obey? Is the traveler’s reading of the inscription different from how that inscription might have been read while the king was alive? And does reading there-fore change over time – is reading historically determined? What does all of this suggest about reading more generally? In this chapter we shall begin to explore some of these questions, referring to Shelley’s poem as a way of summarizing some important developments in literary criticism and theory of the last few decades.
			  Some of the most widely publicized developments in literary theory of the second half of the twentieth century went under the umbrella term reader-response criticism’. Such developments are usually understood as a reaction against Anglo-American ‘new criticism’ of the post-war period. Before we discuss reader-response criticism itself, then, it might be useful brieﬂy to outline the position of new criticism with regard to readers and reading. Associated with such US critics as Cleanth Brooks, W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley, and indebted also to the principles of ‘practical criticism’ associated with the British critics I.A. Richards and F.R. Leavis, new criticism involved a way of reading that emphasized form – the importance of considering ‘the words on the page’ – rather than factors such as the life of the author and his or her intentions, or the historical and ideological context in which the text was produced. New critics considered that such questions, while no doubt interesting, were irrelevant to a consideration of the text itself: they thought of literary texts as ‘autonomous’, as self-sufﬁcient and self-contained unities, as aesthetic objects made of words. Correspondingly, new critics argued that to try to take account of readers’ reactions or responses in the con-text of, for example, a poem, was to introduce an alien and fundamentally extraneous factor. They even invented a term for what they saw as the ‘error’ involved in talking about a reader’s response in discussions of literary texts: they called it the ‘affective fallacy’. For new critics, then, what was import-ant was to pay scrupulous attention to the words of texts themselves, thus bypassing the subjective impressionism of the reader’s response.
		- 2.2.1
			- The poem "Ozymandias" raises questions about readers and reading, such as who is the traveler who reads the inscription and is the sculptor's mocking of the king's face a kind of reading?
			- These questions lead to a discussion of the power relations of any reading and whether reading is historically determined.
			- This chapter will explore some of these questions and reference developments in literary criticism and theory of the last few decades.
			- One of these developments is reader-response criticism, which emerged as a reaction against new criticism's emphasis on form and autonomy of literary texts.
			- New critics believed that readers' reactions or responses were irrelevant and even called it the "affective fallacy". Instead, they focused on the words of the text itself.
		- **2.3**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Like all critical movements, new criticism created its own special canon of literary works and authors. Shelley, notoriously, was not much in evidence in the new critical canon: in his inﬂuential book Revaluation (1936), F.R. Leavis had set the trend by caustically opining that Shelley was ‘almost unreadable’, and that the effect of his eloquence was ‘to hand poetry over to a sensibility that has no more dealings with intelligence than it can help’ (Leavis 1972, 171, 175). In his book The Romantic Poets, Graham Hough declared rather dismissively that ‘Ozymandias is an extremely clear and direct poem, advancing to a predetermined end by means of one ﬁrmly held image’ (Hough 1967, 142). Dismissing the poem in this way is odd in view of the fact that irony, ambiguity and paradox are key elements in the new critical weaponry of reading, and that all three are dramatically at stake in lines 10 and 11 of the poem, the inscription on the pedestal. ‘Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!’ is ironic, for example, from at least two perspectives. First, the line can be read as an example of ‘hubris’ or excessive pride on the part of Ozymandias, who is thus shown to be absurd. Second, it can be read as ironic from Ozymandias’s point of view: knowing that even he will die, Ozymandias inscribes these words for future generations, reminding us that even the greatest will be forgotten in time. These conﬂicting ironies produce both ambiguity and paradox – ambiguity concerning which reading is more valid, and paradox in the fact that the inscription appears to say two conﬂicting things.
			  Beginning in the late 1960s and becoming increasingly inﬂuential in the 1970s and early 1980s, reader-response criticism directly questioned the principles of new criticism. For critics and theorists such as Wolfgang Iser, Stanley Fish and Michael Riffaterre, questions of the literary text and its meaning(s) cannot be disengaged from the role that the reader takes. Although these and other reader-response critics have widely different approaches to literary texts, they all agree that the meaning of the text is created through the process of reading. What they object to in new criticism is the notion that a certain quality or ‘meaning’ of a literary text simply lies there in the text waiting for the reader or critic to come along and identify it. Graham Hough’s apparently objective assertion that ‘Ozymandias’ is ‘extremely clear and direct’, for ex-ample, elides the question of ‘to whom?’ Hough appears to generalize what is, in fact, his particular view of the poem. As we have tried to suggest, the poem may also be read very differently, as syntactically complex and semantically dense. The new critics’ sense that the meaning of a poem is simply there involves thinking of meaning (in Terry Eagleton’s memorable metaphor) as like a wisdom tooth, ‘waiting patiently to be extracted’ (Eagleton 1996, 77). Reacting against what we might characterize as the ‘dentistry’ school of criticism, reader-response critics recognize that the meanings of a text rely, in a dynamic way, on the work of the reader. Given that reading is a necessary dimension of any text, these critics attempt to plot the process of reading and the role of the reader.
		- 2.3.1
			- New criticism created its own canon of literary works and authors, and Shelley was not much in evidence.
			- However, the irony, ambiguity, and paradox in "Ozymandias" make it a suitable subject for new critical reading, despite dismissals by some critics.
			- Reader-response criticism emerged in the late 1960s and challenged the principles of new criticism by recognizing that the meaning of a text is created through the process of reading and that the reader's role is crucial.
			- The meanings of a text rely on the work of the reader, and reader-response critics attempt to plot the process of reading and the role of the reader.

			- Rather than closing down the questions of ‘who reads?’ and ‘what is reading?’, however, reader-response criticism has opened a postmodern Pandora’s box. Critics such as Norman Holland and David Bleich, for ex-ample, are interested in investigating ways in which particular individuals respond to texts, and with exploring ways in which such responses can be related to those individuals’ ‘identity themes’, to their personal psychic dis-positions – the individual character of their desires, needs, experiences, resistances and so on. This is often referred to as ‘subjective criticism’ or ‘personal criticism’. Such critics would not be interested in deciding which reading of line eleven of ‘Ozymandias’ is ‘correct’ because such correctness or accuracy is beside the point. Norman Holland, for example, argues that ‘interpretation is a function of identity’ and that ‘all of us, as we read, use the literary work to symbolize and ﬁnally to replicate ourselves’ (Holland 1980, 123, 124). To parody the logic of subjective criticism, we might suppose that a reader whose irregular potty-training has resulted in a pathological hatred of authority-ﬁgures will delight in the ironic treatment of the King of Kings in Shelley’s poem, while another reader who has early come to associate father-ﬁgures with absence and unreliability will see the poem as a poignant conﬁrmation of the inevitable disappearance of all fathers. Although Holland assures his reader that he is not ‘positing an isolated solipsistic self’ (Holland 1980, 131), this is precisely the danger that other critics have seen in this kind of criticism: such a reliance on the autonomy of the reader’s thoughts and feelings seems to lead to a state of delusion epitomized by Ozymandias’s hollow words.
			  Theorists such as Stanley Fish, on the other hand, argue that any individual reader is necessarily part of a ‘community’ of readers. Every reader, he suggests, reads according to the conventions of his or her ‘interpretive community’. In other words, an individual reader’s response, according to this model, is determined by the conventions of reading into which he or she has been educated within a particular socio-historical context. Our recognition of the equivocality of ‘Ozymandias’, for example, is determined by the fact that we have been taught to look and listen for ambiguity and polysemia in literary texts.
			  A third inﬂuential strand of reader-response criticism is exempliﬁed by the work of Wolfgang Iser. Iser elaborates ways in which the work of reading involves an interaction between elements of the text and the act of reading itself. He explores ways in which the text is ‘concretized’ – given shape or meaning in the act of reading. For Iser, neither the text nor the reader should be studied in isolation. Rather, the text produces certain ‘blanks’ or ‘gaps’ that the reader must attempt to complete: the reader ‘is drawn into the events and made to supply what is meant from what is not said’ (Iser 1995, 24). For Iser, the fact that we know nothing about the traveler in Shelley’s poem, for ex-ample, ‘spurs the reader into action’ (24). ‘Who is this traveler?’ we might ask. ‘What does he or she think about what is described in the poem?’ The text prompts us imaginatively to ﬁll in or ﬁll out such hermeneutic or interpretative ‘gaps’.
		- 2.4.1
			- Reader-response criticism has opened up a postmodern Pandora's box, with different critics exploring the ways in which particular individuals respond to texts and how these responses can be related to personal psychic dispositions. This is known as subjective or personal criticism.
			- Critics like Norman Holland argue that interpretation is a function of identity and that every reader uses the literary work to symbolize and replicate themselves.
			- However, others see a danger in relying too heavily on the autonomy of the reader's thoughts and feelings. Stanley Fish argues that every reader is part of an interpretive community and reads according to the conventions of that community.
			- Wolfgang Iser explores the ways in which the work of reading involves an interaction between elements of the text and the act of reading itself. For Iser, the text produces blanks or gaps that the reader must attempt to complete, spurring the reader into action.

			- During the 1980s and 1990s, the political dimensions of reading became increasingly central to critical debate. Literary texts have been read in terms of power relations, in accordance with Michel Foucault’s suggestion that ‘power is everywhere’ (Foucault 1981, 93) – even in reading. ‘Ozymandias’, in fact, produces multiple representations of the relationship between power and reading. Most explicitly there is the sculptor’s ‘reading’ of the power of the king.
			  The word ‘mocked’ means both ‘imitated’ or ‘copied’ and ‘ridiculed’ (a misrepresentation that represents more accurately or more cruelly). The commanding power of the king – his power, not least, to make the sculptor ‘read’ his face and to copy it on to stone – is resisted in that very reading, in that mockery. The sculptor’s ‘reading’ is both a copy, a faithful representation, and a reading which ridicules. Reading here is ﬁgured as both faithful, an action of subservience, and a subversive act of resistance to power, a transfer and trans-formation of power. Alternatively, we might consider ways in which the poem suggests that acts of reading are bound up in the historical speciﬁcity of power relations. The reading of the statue and the inscription, in this sense, changes over time. Someone contemporary with the King of Kings might read the commanding inscription – ‘Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!’ – as a statement of omnipotence. By contrast, a reader who, like the traveler, reads the inscription surrounded by the ‘lone and level sands’, by the absence of those works, their non-survival, can only read them ironically. What has remained, what has survived, is the work of the sculptor, the represented ‘passions’ of the king (itself a kind of reading), not his works. The power relations of text and reader have shifted decisively over time. Reading, in this sense, is not always and everywhere the same. As Robert Young comments, Shelley’s poem ‘demonstrates that meaning, like power, is not stable or ﬁxed, and that even power cannot guarantee a tyranny of meaning: although authors may have intentions when they write, once they have written they cannot control and ﬁx the meaning of any reading’ (Young 1991a, 238). Finally, we might extrapolate from this to think about the way in which any reading produces a certain relation of power. Shelley’s poem might itself be read as a kind of ‘cold command’ – a command to read. But any reading of the poem must constitute a form of resistance to such a command, a ‘mockery’ of that command, by the imposition or ‘stamping’ of its own interpretation on the poem. Reading survives the command of the text.
		- 2.5.1
			- The passage explores how the act of reading is intertwined with power relations, and how "Ozymandias" can be read as a text that produces multiple representations of the relationship between power and reading.
			- The sculptor's "reading" of the power of the king, for example, is both a faithful representation and a subversive act of resistance to power. Additionally, the poem suggests that the act of reading is historically determined and can change over time.
			- What was once read as a statement of omnipotence by someone contemporary with the King of Kings is now read ironically by a reader surrounded by the "lone and level sands."
			- Finally, the passage suggests that any reading produces a certain relation of power, and that reading survives the command of the text.
		- **2.6**
		  collapsed:: true
			- As part of this emphasis on power-relations, recent criticism has also given increased attention to questions of gender and race. Judith Fetterley, for ex-ample, has argued that female readers of classic US ﬁction (and, by implica-tion, of other literary texts) have been ‘emasculated’, by which she means that they have traditionally been taught to read ‘as men’ (Fetterley 1978). Writing in the late 1970s, Fetterley argues that women should begin to liberate themselves from the notion of a ‘universal’ reader (who is implicitly male) and from an identiﬁcation with male viewpoints in reading, and to develop speciﬁcally female models of reading. At stake here is, in Jonathan Culler’s terms, the question of what it would mean to read ‘as a woman’ (Culler 1983, 43–64): how might ‘reading as a woman’ be different from ‘reading as a man’? 
			  And do we know what it means to read ‘as a man’? It might be possible to think about Shelley’s poem in terms of gendered reading. If we can assume that the traveler is male (after all, few solitary European travelers were female in the early nineteenth century), then one can see that the poem is not only about male pride, but also about male reading. The poem, indeed, is overwhelmingly masculine, a text from which women have been excluded. Yet few critics have been troubled by questions of sexual difference in relation to ‘Ozymandias’: in this respect, we might suggest, the critical response has been ‘emasculated’. From Fetterley’s perspective, we might ask how a non-emasculated reading would respond to the masculine power-play of Shelley’s poem.
			  Critics concerned with questions of race and ethnicity have also developed speciﬁc strategies of reading and talking about reading. Theorists such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Henry Louis Gates Jr and Edward Said, for example, have transformed the nature of contemporary literary studies through their emphasis on questions of colonization, ethnic difference, racial oppression and discrimination, the position of the subaltern, the West and its construction of the ‘other’, imperialism and Orientalism. Edward Said, for instance, argues for what he calls ‘contrapuntal reading’ whereby, in reading a text, one ‘open[s] it out both to what went into it and to what its author excluded’ (Said 1993, 79). Our reading of Jane Eyre in terms of race and slavery in Chapter 24 suggests one such ‘contrapuntal’ reading. Similarly, Henry Louis Gates makes questions of reading central to black literary criticism and theory when he argues that black people in the United States have had to develop particular strategies of reading and interpretation for survival: Black people have always been masters of the ﬁgurative: saying one thing to mean something quite other has been basic to black survival in oppressive Western cultures. Misreading signs could be, and indeed often was, fatal. ‘Reading’, in this sense, was not play; it was an essential aspect of the ‘literacy’ training of a child. (Gates 1984, 6)
		- 2.6.1
			- The phrase "contrapuntal reading" is used by Edward Said to refer to a method of reading that involves opening a text to both what went into it and what the author excluded.
			- This method is useful in reading texts that deal with questions of colonization, ethnic difference, racial oppression and discrimination, the position of the subaltern, the West and its construction of the "other," imperialism, and Orientalism.
			- Similarly, Henry Louis Gates Jr. argues that black people in the United States have had to develop particular strategies of reading and interpretation for survival.
			- According to Gates, black people have always been masters of the figurative and reading has been an essential aspect of the "literacy" training of a child.
			- Black people have developed particular strategies of reading and interpretation that involve saying one thing to mean something quite other, and these strategies have been crucial for their survival in oppressive Western cultures.

			- A reading concerned with questions of race might start from the fact that this English poem deals with a racial other – Egyptian or African – and explore the way in which such otherness is inscribed in the poem. The fact that the land is referred to as ‘antique’, for example, entirely effaces any possibility of a contemporary civilization and culture there. There is nothing beside the barrenness of the ‘lone and level sands’. For this poem, Africa apparently only signiﬁes in terms of a mythical past.
			  The recent emergence of ecocriticism has allowed for important new ways of reading such a poem (see Chapter 16, below). From this perspective, 
			  ‘Ozymandias’ is concerned with the relationship between the human, speciﬁcally in this case an ancient human culture, and the environment. Once you think of the poem in this context, its force immediately alters. It is no longer a poem only about the relationships between people – the pharaoh, the sculptor, the traveler, the speaker and his addressee, the poet, the reader –but also about the effect that a civilization has had on its environment, on what is now the wasted landscape so poignantly described. According to such a reading, Shelley’s poem would be understood to respond to the ecological destruction caused by monumental human arrogance. This desolate land-scape (‘boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away’) can be seen not as ‘natural’ but as having been produced by human intervention (perhaps by over-cultivation, or through the redirection of water for irrigation or by other geo-engineering endeavors). After all, we can safely assume that in Ozymandias’s time, the land surrounding the statue was able to sustain the life that this poem represents only in its absence. An ecocritical reading would pay attention not only to the poem’s engagement with political and aesthetic questions, then, but also to the wider ramiﬁcations of its stark analysis of the eco-destruction that has typiﬁed human ‘civilization’ down the ages.
		- 2.7.1
			- An ecocritical reading of "Ozymandias" would focus on the relationship between human civilization and the environment, specifically in terms of the ecological destruction caused by human arrogance.
			- This reading would suggest that the barren landscape described in the poem was not a natural state but rather a result of human intervention such as over-cultivation or the redirection of water for irrigation.
			- The poem would be seen as a response to the devastating impact of human civilization on the environment.
			- This reading would shift the focus of the poem from its engagement with political and aesthetic questions to the wider ramifications of its analysis of eco-destruction.

		  collapsed:: true
			- Finally, a poststructuralist or deconstructive reading of ‘Ozymandias’ might, in addition to these concerns, trace the dispersal or dissolution of the reader’s identity in the act of reading and question the very possibility of interpretive mastery. For poststructuralists, there is a dynamic signiﬁcance in the question of which comes ﬁrst – the text or the reader? Is reading simply something that happens to a text as if by chance, something which leaves a text fundamentally unaltered? If so, then the role of the reader would appear to be determined by the text itself: each literary text would be like a set of instructions, a kind of recipe, for how it should be read. By contrast, the text may be understood as fundamentally incomplete, to be effected in the act of reading. In this case the text is remade in every reading. Rather than choosing between these two hypotheses, deconstructive theories of reading argue that both models are operative, in a peculiar double bind of reading: the reader makes the text and the text makes the reader. Deconstruction explores the space between these two possibilities and it seeks to highlight ways in which every reading and every text is unpredictable. Thus deconstruction is interested in the fact that while any text demands a ‘faithful’ reading, it also demands an individual response. Put differently, reading is at once singular (yours and nobody else’s) and general (conforming to patterns of meaning dictated by the text – a text that does not require you in order to function). Through analysis of these and other paradoxes, critics such as Paul de Man and J. Hillis Miller suggest ways in which reading is strange, unsettling, even ‘impossible’.
		- 2.8.1
			- In a poststructuralist or deconstructive reading of "Ozymandias," the emphasis is on the instability of meaning and the dissolution of the reader's identity in the act of reading.
			- This approach questions the possibility of interpretive mastery and explores the dynamic relationship between the text and the reader.
			- According to deconstructive theories, the text may be understood as fundamentally incomplete and remade in every reading.
			- This double bind of reading highlights the unpredictability of every reading and the paradoxical nature of the reader's relationship to the text.
			- Deconstruction, through the analysis of paradoxes, seeks to show that reading is strange, unsettling, and even "impossible."

			- How should we read the word ‘appear’ in line nine of Shelley’s poem (‘And on the pedestal, these words appear’), for example? What makes these words appear? The word ‘appear’ might be shown to challenge all conventional preconceptions concerning reading. In particular, it challenges us to rethink the relationship between a text on the one hand simply appearing, simply being there like a monument, to be read, appearing from nowhere, and on the other hand a text appearing in the sense of ‘seeming’, an apparition, made in reading. Is the text there, or do we make it appear, do we imagine it? Jacques Derrida has referred to the delirium of reading, a pun or ‘portmanteau’ word which combines the French ‘lire’ (‘to read’) with ‘delirium’, to suggest ways in which reading can be delirious or hallucinatory (Derrida 1979, 94, quoting Blanchot). Just as we can never know how ‘well’, how accurately or faithfully the sculptor has read the king’s passions, neither can we escape the dynamics of reading and delirium. In short, we can never stop reading because we can never ﬁnally know if what ‘appears’ in this poem is us reading or us being read. This is not to suggest we should therefore give up, either in despair or in indifference. Our very lives and identities are at stake. If, as we have argued, ‘Ozymandias’ is as much about readers and reading as about anything else, then we might see that the relation between reading and being read is strangely twisted: not only do we read the poem but the poem reads us. Like Ozymandias himself, we are fragmented, mute and transient: our ‘passions’ are read, and perhaps mocked, by the sculptor, in the form of the poem itself. After all, in reading this poem, we perhaps cannot avoid a ventriloquist's articulation, silent or not, of the king’s words – My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings, Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! How do you read that? What happens to you, to your name?
		- 2.9.1
			- The word ‘appear’ in line nine of Shelley’s poem can be read in multiple ways, challenging conventional preconceptions about reading.

			- We can never know how accurately or faithfully the sculptor has read the king’s passions, and we can never escape the dynamics of reading and delirium.

			  a number of ways of thinking about the figure of the author. It

			  on the level – nothing pretentious here, none of ‘that David Copperfield kind

			  writing. The sentence is playing a type of literary game with conventions of
			  novel openings. Of course, we quickly learn that the ‘I’ here is a 16-year-old
			  American boy called Holden Caulfield, but this is not something that is made
			  clear in the first sentence. All we can presume at this point is that we are reading that particular kind of text called a novel and that it has been written by
			  J.D. Salinger. The literary game that is set in motion by this opening sentence
			  has to do with the relationship between fiction (a novel) and truth (biography
			  or autobiography), as well as between an author and a narrator. This is suggested
			  by the apparently deprecating reference to David Copperfield (‘all that
			  David Copperfield kind of crap’). There is, then, a metafictional dimension
			  in this seemingly simple opening sentence – metafictional in the sense that it
			  explicitly refers to itself and draws attention to the fact that a story is being told.
			  The narrator invokes the protagonist of one of the ‘classic’ English nineteenth-century
			  novels and implies, even by denying it, a correlation with another
			  literary text.

			- The opening sentence of J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye can be interpreted in a number of ways, and it sets in motion a literary game with conventions of novel openings.
			- On one level, the sentence presents a candid, colloquial voice that addresses the reader directly and seems concerned with our wishes and desires.
			- However, the sentence is also furtive and evasive, as it does not reveal the specifics of the narrator's "lousy childhood" or who is speaking.
			- The word "it" is emphasized but equivocal, and it is not clear whether the "it" at the beginning of the sentence is the same as the "it" at the end.
			- The opening sentence also has a metafictional dimension, as it draws attention to the fact that a story is being told and explicitly refers to itself.
			- The reference to David Copperfield suggests a correlation with another literary text and implies a relationship between fiction and truth, as well as between an author and a narrator.
			- Ultimately, the opening sentence sets up a tension between the apparent straightforwardness of the voice and the underlying ambiguity and complexity of the narrative.

		  collapsed:: true
			- Both David Copperfield and The Catcher in the Rye offer a mixing of novel
			  and (auto)biography. In doing so, they provoke a series of fundamental questions
			  about the relationship between literary texts, narrators, characters and
			  authors. Above all, they provoke the question: who is speaking? In presenting
			  us with the voice of a fictional speaker, these texts draw attention to the figure
			  of the author as a sort of concealed or cryptic, haunting but unspecified presence.
			  Who is behind this ‘I’? The opening of The Catcher in the Rye thus introduces
			  a general question for literary criticism and theory, the question of the
			  presence of another ‘I’ – the haunting absent-presence of the ‘I’ who writes, of
			  the author. The author is a kind of ghost. Salinger’s novel provides more than
			  one illustration of this. A few pages further on, for example, Holden Caulfield
			  tells us:
			  What really knocks me out is a book that, when you’re all done reading it,
			  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could
			  call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn’t happen
			  much, though. I wouldn’t mind calling this Isak Dinesen up. And Ring
			  Lardner, except that D.B. [Holden’s brother] told me he’s dead. You take
			  that book Of Human Bondage, by Somerset Maugham, though. I read it last
			  summer. It’s a pretty good book and all, but I wouldn’t want to call
			  Somerset Maugham up. I don’t know. He just isn’t the kind of a guy I’d want
			  to call up, that’s all. I’d rather call old Thomas Hardy up. I like that Eustacia
			  Vye. (22)
			  Again, this passage is delightfully straightforward and yet extraordinarily
			  suggestive. It presents us with what is in many respects an undeniable truth, as
			  well as with what constitutes one of the curious effects of literature: literary
			  texts can generate powerful feelings of identification, not only between reader
			  and character but also, perhaps more enigmatically, between reader and
			  author. You really can be drawn into the feeling that the author is ‘a terrific friend of yours’ or that your appreciation and understanding of an author is
			  so intense it touches on the telepathic. Holden’s reference to getting on the
			  phone to the author is uncannily apposite: the rapport that exists between you
			  and your favorite author is indeed a sort of linguistic tele-link. The author
			  is an absent presence, both there and not there. You may feel that you understand
			  like nobody else what it is that the author is saying; and you may be
			  willing to acknowledge that this author can express your opinions, thoughts
			  and feelings as well as or even better than you yourself could. This is, in fact,
			  precisely how the greatness of Shakespeare is often described. It is what
			  William Hazlitt says, for example, in his 1818 lecture ‘On Shakespeare and
			  Milton’: ‘the striking peculiarity of Shakespeare’s mind’ is ‘its power of
			  communication with all other minds’ (Hazlitt 1910, 47).
			  At the same time, however, this passage from The Catcher in the Rye
			  prompts us to reflect on at least two other points. First, it is not (not usually,
			  anyway) a two-way friendship that a reader enjoys with an author. Indeed, this
			  one-waywardness is part of the fantasy of reading: the ‘author’ is generally not
			  someone whose telephone number you can readily acquire and with whom
			  you really can become terrific friends in the way that Caulfield is suggesting.
			  The author, in other words, is not so much an ‘actual’ author at all: rather,
			  it is your personal projection, your idea of the author. Second, it is also the
			  case that the author not only may be dead but in some respects is dead, even
			  when alive. Part of the irony and humor of this passage from Salinger’s novel
			  consists in the blurring of the distinction between living authors and dead
			  ones. For despite his concern with the problem of giving Ring Lardner a ring,
			  given that Ring Lardner cannot be rung (since he is dead), Holden Caulfield
			  concludes his ‘call-an-author’ fantasy by saying he would like to ‘call old
			  Thomas Hardy up’ – as if Hardy, though ‘old’, still lived. As we might all be
			  reasonably expected to know, Thomas Hardy is (and was, well before 1951) in
			  his grave. (Or to be more precise, in two graves: his heart is buried with the
			  body of his first wife, in Stinsford churchyard, Dorset; the rest of him is in
			  Westminster Abbey.)
		- 3.2.1
			- The mixing of novel and (auto)biography in David Copperfield and The Catcher in the Rye raises fundamental questions about the relationship between literary texts, narrators, characters, and authors.
			- Specifically, it prompts the question of who is speaking and draws attention to the figure of the author as a concealed, haunting but unspecified presence.
			- Salinger's novel illustrates this through Holden Caulfield's desire to call up authors as if they were friends, generating feelings of identification with the author and their work.
			- However, this desire is also marked by certain ironies and limitations.
			- Firstly, the author is often an absent presence, a personal projection of the reader's idea of the author.
			- Secondly, the author may also be dead, blurring the distinction between living and dead authors.
			- Holden's reference to wanting to "call old Thomas Hardy up" is humorous and ironic, as Hardy has long been deceased.
			- Ultimately, the presence of the author in literature is both powerful and elusive, prompting a complex relationship between author, reader, and text.

			- A lot has been said and written over the past few decades about ‘the death
			  of the author’. This paradoxical idea refers not to the empirical or literal death
			  of a given author, but to the fact that, in a radical sense, the author is absent
			  from the text. ‘The death of the author’ became a catch-phrase primarily on
			  account of an essay of that title, written by the French poststructuralist Roland
			  Barthes and first published in 1967. Barthes’s essay is flamboyant and
			  provocative. In part, he is arguing against the very common ascription of
			  authority to the figure of the author. People often ask, for example: ‘Is that
			  what Shakespeare (or Brontë or Dickens) really meant? Is that what the author intended?’ Such questions reflect what W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley
			  described, in an essay first published in 1946 (rev. 1954), as ‘the intentional
			  fallacy’ (Wimsatt and Beardsley 1995). In what became a conceptual cornerstone
			  of Anglo-American New Criticism, they argued that ‘the design or
			  intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for
			  judging the success of a literary work’ (Wimsatt and Beardsley 1995, 90).
			  All we have, they argued, is the text itself, and the work of criticism has no
			  business inquiring into the quite separate question of its author’s intentions.
			  Indeed, Wimsatt and Beardsley contend that any answer to the question of
			  what, for example, T.S. Eliot meant by ‘Prufrock’ ‘would have nothing to do’
			  with the poem itself (Wimsatt and Beardsley 1995, 99). Even if we were to go
			  to a living author and ask what he or she meant by a particular text, all we
			  would get would be another text (his or her answer), which would then, in
			  turn, be open to interpretation. Just because it comes ‘from the horse’s mouth’
			  does not mean that the horse is telling the truth, or that the horse knows the
			  truth, or indeed that what the horse has to say about the ‘words on the page’ is
			  necessarily more interesting or illuminating than what anyone else might have
			  to say. As anyone who has read an ‘interview with the author’ will know, the
			  words you get from the horse’s mouth often tell us more about the horse than
			  about the text we were trying to read: an author interview tends to take us away
			  from the strange specificity of the literary work into the labyrinths of biography,
			  projection and fantasy.
			  We could also ponder the question of ‘authorial intention’ in the light of psychoanalysis.
			  ‘Conscious intention’, in this respect, can always be considered
			  as subject to the unconscious workings of the mind. With psychoanalysis, it is
			  no longer possible simply to privilege consciousness as the sombre judge of
			  what is intended. The jurisdiction of ‘authorial intention’ falters here: what is
			  not meant can still (in another sense) be meant. ‘I didn’t mean to hurt you’
			  might, after all, mean ‘I did’. In the wake of psychoanalysis, in particular, it is
			  difficult if not impossible to suppose that intention can ever be pure and
			  unambiguous. Correspondingly, it is important to acknowledge some of the
			  implications of twentieth-century linguistics (Saussure, Chomsky, Pinker) as
			  regards this question of the author and his or her authority. Rather than say
			  that the author is in control of the language that he or she uses, we might consider
			  the idea that the language is as much in control of the author. In this
			  respect, language can be thought of as a kind of system within which any writer
			  must take a designated place: the system and rules of language inevitably dictate
			  the possibilities of what someone can say. An author is not God, after all.
		- 3.3.1
			- "The death of the author" refers to the idea that, in a radical sense, the author is absent from the text.
			- This idea became popular after Roland Barthes wrote an essay with that title in 1967.
			- Barthes was arguing against the common assumption that the author has ultimate authority over their work.
			- According to him, the text is what matters, and the work of criticism should focus on interpreting the text itself, rather than trying to decipher the author's intentions.
			- This argument is supported by the "intentional fallacy," which was described by W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley in 1946.
			- They argued that the author's intentions are not relevant to the interpretation of the text, and that the text should be judged on its own merits.
			- They contended that even if we were to ask a living author what they meant by a particular text, their answer would simply be another text, open to interpretation.
			- Psychoanalysis also challenges the idea of authorial intention, as conscious intention is always subject to the unconscious workings of the mind.
			- The implications of twentieth-century linguistics also suggest that language is in control of the author, rather than the other way around.
			- Ultimately, the idea of the death of the author challenges our assumptions about the relationship between the author and the text.
			- The author is not the ultimate authority over the text, and their intentions may not be clear or relevant to the interpretation of the work. The focus should be on the text itself and its relationship to the reader.

			- Barthes’s essay provides a strong sense of the ways in which we need, if not
			  to ridicule, at least to be skeptical about the idea of the author as the origin and
			  end of the meaning of a text. But rather than solving the problem of interpretive
			  authority, ‘The Death of the Author’ in certain respects simply transfers it.
			  Barthes ends his essay by declaring that ‘the death of the author’ coincides
			  with ‘the birth of the reader’ (Barthes 1977a, 118). But as we suggest in the
			  preceding chapter, such a claim is manifestly problematic: after all, the critique
			  of the notion of the Author (to which Barthes wittily gives a capital ‘A’, thus
			  highlighting the putatively god-like attributes of this figure) is just as valid as a
			  critique of the notion of the reader (who, in effect, simply acquires in Barthes’s
			  account a capital ‘R’ instead). Nevertheless, his essay does offer some crucial
			  and succinct remarks on the idea of the author and it remains a valuable
			  account. Barthes writes:
			  We know now that a text is not a line of words releasing a single ‘theological’
			  meaning (the ‘message’ of the Author–God) but a multi-dimensional space
			  in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The
			  text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture
			  . . . Once the Author is removed, the claim to decipher a text becomes quite
			  futile. To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it
			  with a final signified, to close the writing. (Barthes 1977a, 146)
			  In a sense the problem here is evident simply from the two words which frame
			  the above quotation: ‘Barthes writes’. We are still talking in terms of the author
			  and there could be little more persuasive indication of the idea that the author
			  is not dead (though Roland Barthes, sadly, is) than the use of the present tense:
			  Barthes writes. But at the same time we need to be careful here. The ‘death of
			  the author’, in Barthesian terms, is explicitly figurative or metaphorical, and
			  we could say, by way of a sort of corrective to possible misreading in this context,
			  that the author cannot die precisely because, as we’ve been suggesting,
			  the author is – always has been and always will be – a ghost. Never fully present
			  or fully absent, a figure of fantasy and elusiveness, the author only ever haunts.
			  It is also important to stress that Barthes is not in fact talking about ‘the author’
			  but ‘the Author’. Insofar as the metaphorical death makes sense, then, it is the
			  death of a particular concept of the Author that is at stake. In this respect
			  Barthes’s essay has to be seen in its cultural and historical context, as providing
			  a simplified but forceful articulation of a variety of intellectual positions
			  that emerged in the 1960s, in France and elsewhere.
		- 3.4.1
			- In summary, Barthes's essay "The Death of the Author" argues against the common assumption that the author is the ultimate source and authority of a text's meaning.
			- Instead, Barthes suggests that meaning is created through a complex interplay of cultural influences and interpretations by readers.
			- The idea of the author as a solitary genius or divine creator is dismissed as limiting and inaccurate.
			- However, while Barthes's essay challenges the authority of the author, it does not completely do away with the concept of the author. The author remains a figure of elusiveness and fantasy, neither fully present nor fully absent from the text.
		- **3.5**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Barthes’s essay should be read alongside Michel Foucault’s ‘What Is an
			  Author?’ (1969), an essay that is undoubtedly more systematic and rigorous
			  in many respects. More drily but more carefully than Barthes, Foucault provides
			  a forceful and luminous impression of the figure of the author as a
			  historical construction. The idea of the author is not a timeless given: the figure
			  and significance of the author varies across time, and from one culture to
			  another, from one discourse to another, and so on. As regards works of literature,
			  Foucault is concerned to criticize the notion of the author as ‘the principle
			  of a certain unity of writing’ (Foucault 1979, 151). In other words, like
			  Barthes, he calls into question the idea that the author is a god-like or (in more
			  Foucauldian terms) saint-like figure, that the author is the presiding authority
			  or principle of coherence for the understanding of a text. He does this primarily
			  by focusing on the historical and ideological determinations of the notion
			  of the author. He notes, for example, that
			  There was a time when the texts that we today call ‘literary’ (narratives,
			  stories, epics, tragedies, comedies) were accepted, put into circulation, and
			  valorized without any question about the identity of their author; their
			  anonymity caused no difficulties since their ancientness, whether real or
			  imagined, was regarded as a sufficient guarantee of their status. (Foucault
			  1979, 149)
			  And he emphasizes that, more recently, literary authorship has been integrally
			  bound up with changes in law and questions of copyright and ownership of
			  texts. Finally, like Barthes, Foucault is interested in the potentially revolutionary
			  effects of writing. ‘What Is an Author?’ affirms the jubilatory – because
			  anti-authoritarian (here the correlations between ‘author’ and ‘authority’
			  become explicit) – energies of a writing or discourse freed of the conventional
			  impositions of authorship. Foucault emphasizes the paradox that, while we
			  think of the author as ‘a perpetual surging of invention’, in fact ‘we make him
			  [or her] function in exactly the opposite fashion’. While we think of the author
			  as endlessly creative, in other words, our practice of reading and criticism
			  makes him or her into a locus of authority that confines meaning and
			  significance to a single univocal strand. Foucault thus concludes: ‘The author
			  is, therefore, the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we
			  fear the proliferation of meaning’ (159). We want there to be an identifiable
			  author for a text because this comforts us with the notion that there is a particular
			  sense to that text.
		- 3.5.1
			- Both Barthes and Foucault provide valuable critiques of the notion of the author as a singular, authoritative figure whose intentions and meaning must be privileged in the interpretation of a text.
			- They both argue that the author is a historical and cultural construction, and that the meaning of a text is not fixed or determined by the author's intentions, but rather is constantly evolving and subject to multiple interpretations.
			- They also both emphasize the potential liberatory effects of writing that is freed from the constraints of authorial authority and is open to multiple meanings and interpretations.
			- While Barthes focuses more on the multi-dimensionality of a text, drawing from a variety of cultural sources, Foucault highlights the role of the author as an ideological figure that constrains meaning and stifles the proliferation of multiple interpretations.
		- **3.6**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Barthes and Foucault, among many others, are interested in thinking about
			  literature in ways that do not depend on regarding the author as the origin of
			  the meaning of a text or as the authoritative ‘presence’ in that text. Contemporary
			  literary theory draws together threads from psychoanalysis (the ‘I’ is in
			  many ways by definition not in control of itself, since it is determined by what
			  it cannot control, in other words, by the unconscious), linguistics (language
			  speaks us as much as we speak language), ethnology (creativity, authorship,
			  etc. are differently constructed and conceived in different cultures) and feminism
			  (the Author with a capital A is in many respects clearly – and oppressively
			  – male: God, the Father, the patriarchal Presence). Nevertheless, the figure
			  of the author remains a decisive force in contemporary culture – for all kinds
			  of reasons, some of them entirely admirable. Thus in women’s writing,
			  for example, or in the study of supposedly non-mainstream (i.e. non-white,
			  non-US-or-European, non-middle-class, non-heterosexual) writing, there
			  has been and continues to be an emphasis on the person of the author, an
			  emphasis that is in some ways quite conventional and ‘conformist’. This
			  emphasis is particularly characteristic of what has come to be known as identity
			  politics. Such ‘conformism’ is understandable especially if, as theorists of
			  such writing sometimes claim, it is presented as the initial step in a longer-term
			  strategy of disturbing, dislocating and transforming anthropocentric, patriarchal,
			  white, bourgeois or ‘straight’ values. In truth, however, the literary works
			  that endure are those which exceed or elide all or any of the constraints
			  imposed by identity politics.
			  At the same time it is also true that what we think about a particular text,
			  how we read and understand it, can probably never be simply dissociated
			  from what we know (or think we know) of its author. The fact that we know
			  (assuming that we do) that John Keats died of tuberculosis at the tragically
			  early age of 25 cannot but affect the way we read those prophetically poignant
			  lines from ‘Ode to a Nightingale’ (1819), written only two years before his
			  death:
			  Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
			  To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
			  While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
			  In such an ecstasy!
			  Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—
			  To thy high requiem become a sod.
			  Similarly, the fact that Ezra Pound made Fascist propaganda broadcasts on
			  Italian radio cannot but affect the way that we read his Cantos. But it is still
			  important to bear in mind that there is something deeply problematic about
			  any straightforward reduction of a text to what we think we know of the
			  author’s life, thoughts, habits or ideas. In particular, the attempt to settle questions
			  of interpretation through appeals to the intentions of the author cannot
			  but be viewed with suspicion. It is not a question of simply denying or ignoring
			  authorial intention: some hypothesis of what an author intends is an important
			  element in reading and sense-making. But reading and sense-making
			  invariably overflow ‘mere’ authorial intention. Correspondingly, we could
			  say, it is not a question (as Barthes polemically argued) of simply ‘removing’
			  the author, but rather of acknowledging that s/he has a less central and authoritative,
			  in some ways more ghostly role. In this respect, we might say, the
			  author was dead from the start. Specifically, as Jacques Derrida has argued,
			  an author is ‘dead insofar as his [or her] text has a structure of survival even
			  if he [or she] is living’ (Derrida 1985a, 183). Like any piece of writing (even a
			  text-message), a literary work is capable of outliving its author. This capacity
			  for the text to live on is part of its structure, of what makes it a text. This is not
			  something that the author can control. More generally, no author owns the
			  meanings or the readings of his or her text.
		- 3.6.1
			- Overall, contemporary literary theory challenges the idea that the author is the sole or primary source of a text's meaning and significance.
			- Instead, literary theorists draw from fields such as psychoanalysis, linguistics, ethnology, and feminism to think about how texts and meanings are constructed and experienced.
			- While the figure of the author remains important in contemporary culture, particularly in identity politics, literary works that endure often exceed or elide the constraints of such politics.
			- It is also important to recognize that what we know about an author can shape how we read and understand their texts, but any straightforward reduction of a text to the author's intentions or life must be viewed with suspicion.
			- Rather, the author plays a ghostly, less central role in the structure and survival of a text.
			- Ultimately, no author can own the meanings or readings of their text.
		- **3.7**
		  collapsed:: true
			- As we have attempted to show, then, the idea of an author-centred reading
			  is in various ways flawed. No doubt it will never be possible to give up the
			  sense of phantasmatic identification with an author (‘I love Emily Brontë’,
			  ‘John Webster is my hero’). Nor, indeed, are we likely to stop reading literary
			  biographies and being interested in the apparently tangential issues of
			  authors’ love affairs, their compositional practices or even, if all else fails, their
			  shopping lists. But the relationship between life and work is highly complex
			  and highly mediated, and a key to the authorial life is by no means necessarily
			  a key to the literary text. Our identifications with and ideas about authors are,
			  in the final analysis, themselves forms of fiction. We may speculate, fantasize
			  and tell ourselves stories about an author; but the author is a sort of phantom.
			  In keeping with the notion that the author is necessarily a ghost, we could
			  suggest that the greatest literary texts are indeed those in which the author
			  appears most spectral. The most powerful works of literature are those which
			  suggest that they are singular, that no one else could have written them, and yet
			  that their authorship is, in more than one sense, a phantom issue. One need
			  think only, for example, of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the plays of Shakespeare,
			  Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye or
			  of course J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye, to realize that in a sense they
			  tell us nothing about their authors, even if they are texts in which we feel their
			  elusive presence in an especially forceful way. What Keats says of the poet is
			  true of authors generally. The poet as poet has no identity (Keats 1958,
			  1:387): he or she lives, and lives on, in the strange space of writing.
		- 3.7.1
			- In conclusion, the idea of the author as the origin and end of the meaning of a text has been challenged by many contemporary literary theorists.
			- Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault, among others, have shown that the notion of the author is historically constructed and varies across time, culture, and discourse.
			- While the author remains a decisive force in contemporary culture, especially in identity politics, the attempt to settle questions of interpretation through appeals to the intentions of the author is viewed with suspicion.
			- Instead, the author is seen as a ghostly presence in the literary text, and the most powerful works of literature are those that suggest their authorship is a phantom issue.

	  collapsed:: true
		- **4.1**
		  collapsed:: true
			- All of the chapters in this book are, in different ways, about the relationship
			  between texts and the world. How do texts represent the world?
			  Where does a text begin and end? Is an author an inhabitant of the world or
			  the creation of a literary text? To what extent is history a kind of text? And
			  what implications does this have for thinking about literature? Can literary
			  texts do things to the world as well as simply describe it? These are some of
			  the questions with which we engage in this book.
			  The relation between literary texts and the world has been a central problem
			  in criticism and theory at least since the fourth century BC when Plato
			  banished poets from his imaginary Republic for allegedly misrepresenting the
			  world. The very phrase ‘the text and the world’, however, immediately presents
			  a questionable distinction: its very formulation presupposes a difference
			  between a text on the one hand and the world on the other. This distinction is,
			  of course, a very common way of thinking about literature: it is implicit in a
			  certain understanding of mimesis or imitation, and in notions of realism and
			  naturalism, and of representation, as well as in metaphors which suggest that
			  literary texts offer a window onto the world or (in Hamlet’s words) hold
			  a mirror up to nature. All of these ways of thinking about literary texts start
			  from an assumed separation of the literary work, the text, from the world.
			  They imply that a literary text is not, in essence, part of the world. Actually,
			  over the centuries, writers have been trying to drive a stake into the heart of
			  this assumption: the text–world dichotomy is like a vampire that will not lie
			  down. The latest and most persistent of these vampire-killers are called poststructuralists.
			  Poststructuralism (including new historicism, deconstruction,
			  certain forms of feminism, postcolonialism and queer theory) consistently
			  undermines the very terms of this text–world dichotomy. Michel Foucault puts the point in a Nietzschean way: ‘if language expresses, it does so not in
			  so far as it is an imitation and duplication of things, but in so far as it manifests
			  . . . the fundamental will of those who speak it’ (Foucault 1970, 290).
			  Poststructuralists ask what it means to say that a literary text is different from,
			  separate from the world. Shouldn’t we say, rather, that such texts actually make
			  up our world? How can an act of inscription or an act of reading not be part of
			  the world? Is there a world without such acts? In a later chapter, we look at the
			  ways in which texts may be considered as performative, as acts of language
			  which themselves do things, as well as just talk about things. In this chapter, we
			  shall explore the idea that literary texts are acts that destabilize the very notion
			  of the world and that disturb all assumptions about a separation between
			  world and text.

			- The relationship between texts and the world has been a central problem in criticism and theory since ancient times.
			- The assumption that there is a separation between a literary work and the world is implicit in notions of mimesis, realism, and representation. However, poststructuralism challenges this assumption and consistently undermines the very terms of the text-world dichotomy.
			- Poststructuralists ask how literary texts can be considered separate from the world when acts of inscription and acts of reading are part of the world.
			- They argue that literary texts are acts that destabilize the notion of the world and disturb assumptions about a separation between world and text.

			- In order to consider this proposition, we shall discuss Andrew Marvell’s
			  poem ‘To His Coy Mistress’ (1681). The poem presents itself as a work of
			  seduction. The speaker addresses his ‘coy mistress’ and attempts to persuade
			  her to go to bed with him:
			  Had we but world enough, and time,
			  This coyness, lady, were no crime.
			  We would sit down, and think which way
			  To walk, and pass our long love’s day.
			  5 Thou by the Indian Ganges’ side
			  Shouldst rubies find: I by the tide
			  Of Humber would complain. I would
			  Love you ten years before the flood:
			  And you should, if you please, refuse
			  10 Till the conversion of the Jews.
			  My vegetable love should grow
			  Vaster than empires, and more slow.
			  An hundred years should go to praise
			  Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze.
			  15 Two hundred to adore each breast:
			  But thirty thousand to the rest.
			  An age at least to every part,
			  And the last age should show your heart:
			  For, lady, you deserve this state,
			  20 Nor would I love at lower rate.
			  But at my back I always hear
			  Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near:
			  And yonder all before us lie
			  Deserts of vast eternity.
			  25 Thy beauty shall no more be found;
			  Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound
			  My echoing song: then worms shall try
			  That long-preserved virginity:
			  And your quaint honour turn to dust;
			  30 And into ashes all my lust.
			  The grave’s a fine and private place,
			  But none, I think, do there embrace.
			  Now, therefore, while the youthful hue
			  Sits on thy skin like morning dew,
			  35 And while thy willing soul transpires
			  At every pore with instant fires,
			  Now let us sport us while we may,
			  And now, like amorous birds of prey,
			  Rather at once our time devour,
			  40 Than languish in his slow-chapped power.
			  Let us roll all our strength, and all
			  Our sweetness, up into one ball:
			  And tear our pleasures with rough strife,
			  Thorough the iron gates of life.
			  45 Thus, though we cannot make our sun
			  Stand still, yet we will make him run.
			  As soon as we ask even the simplest questions about this poem we come up
			  against the problem of representation, the problem of the relationship
			  between the text and the world. Perhaps the most obvious question that we
			  would want to ask is whether the poem should be read as really a poem of
			  seduction: is the speaker the same as the poet and, if so, is this text really
			  addressed to a woman Andrew Marvell knew? Or should we understand the
			  speaker to be a fictional construction and the ‘real’ addressee to be another
			  reader – us, for example – a reader or readers not explicitly addressed but
			  nevertheless implied by the text? Most readings of the poem assume that the
			  latter is the case, that rather than attempting to seduce a woman, this poem
			  presents a fictional dramatization of such an attempt. In this sense, it may seem
			  that the poem is categorically separate from the ‘real’ world and from ‘real’
			  people. But this poetic attempt at seduction does not just take place between a
			  fictive woman and speaker. In various ways, ‘To His Coy Mistress’ challenges
			  our thinking on fiction and the real. For example, regardless of whether the
			  mistress is conceived as real or fictive, the poem has effects on us. In particular,
			  such a poem can be considered as performative – in the sense that it
			  performs an act not so much of sexual as of textual seduction. It tries to entice
			  us to read and to read on and to draw us into another world – a world of
			  reading that is both fictional and real.
		- 4.2.1
			- The excerpt suggests that literary texts, such as Andrew Marvell's poem "To His Coy Mistress," challenge the notion of a separation between the text and the world.
			- The poem is presented as a work of seduction, and the speaker attempts to persuade a coy mistress to go to bed with him.
			- The excerpt raises questions about the relationship between the text and the world, and whether the poem should be read as a real attempt at seduction or a fictional dramatization.
			- However, the excerpt suggests that the poem has effects on the reader, regardless of whether the mistress is real or fictive, and can be considered performative in the sense that it performs an act of textual seduction, enticing the reader into a world of reading that is both fictional and real.
		- **4.3**

			- But Marvell’s poem does not stop here. It can be shown to engage with the
			  world through the use of a number of specific discourses. The seduction
			  is mediated not only by reference to other kinds of literary texts (poems of
			  seduction, love poems, the blazon, the carpe diem or memento mori motif
			  and so on), but also in terms of other kinds of discourse (biblical, classical,
			  colonial, philosophical, scientific, military). In this respect, the poem could
			  be seen as an example of what the Russian critic M.M. Bakhtin calls
			  ‘heteroglossia’, in that it embraces a series of overlapping codes and discourses.
			  This complex jumble of discourses positions the text in relation
			  to ‘the world’ – even if we try to read the poem as simply fictional.
			  Indeed, rather than thinking of texts on one side and ‘the world’ on the
			  other, we might reflect on the idea that everything human that happens in the
			  world is mediated by language. Language, as Jean-Jacques Lecercle puts it,
			  ‘always reminds us that it, and no one else, is speaking, that whenever we
			  believe we rule over our words, we are in the grip of an unavoidable but nevertheless
			  delusive illusion’ (Lecercle 1990, 265). In this context we could
			  attempt to clarify the notoriously controversial statement by Jacques Derrida,
			  in his book Of Grammatology (1976, 158, 163), that ‘There is nothing outside
			  the text’. This much quoted and much misunderstood slogan is, in fact, a misleading
			  translation of the French sentence ‘Il n’y a pas de hors-texte’, which is
			  perhaps better rendered as ‘There is no outside-text’. The latter version is
			  preferable because it is easier to see that it is saying something credible. When
			  Derrida makes this statement he is talking about reading. His point is not that
			  there is no such thing as a ‘real world’ but that there is no access to the real
			  world of, for example, Marvell’s poem, except through the language of the
			  poem. In other words, there is no reading of ‘To His Coy Mistress’ that is not
			  dependent, precisely, on language: the ‘real world’ of the poem is the poem.
			  We cannot go beyond or transcend the text to Marvell’s coy mistress since our
			  only access to her is through the poem. But Derrida is also making a larger,
			  more difficult claim, arguing that there is no way to conceive, imagine or even
			  perceive ‘the world’ without stubbing our toes on the question of language.
			  Put very crudely, Derrida suggests there is no access to ‘the world’ except,
			  in the broadest sense, through language. ‘Language’ here need not be simply
			  verbal, but may include everything that works as a system of signs. Even
			  without words, for example, seduction is an affair of language – there is the
			  language of eyes, gestures, touch, a complex olfactory system, and so on.
			  Derrida and other theorists of deconstruction, then, regard the text–world
			  opposition as untenable if also perhaps unavoidable. In this respect, those
			  critics of Derrida who argue that his is a ‘pure’ textualism which cannot
			  account for power or politics are simply failing to recognize – or choosing to
			  ignore – the extent to which political, social, economic and historical forces
			  are bound up in language, in discourse, in representation.
		- 4.3.1
			- In light of this, we can see that Marvell’s poem ‘To His Coy Mistress’ is not
			  simply a work of seduction, but a complex work that engages with the world
			  through the use of various discourses and codes.
			- The poem’s use of language, its allusions to various historical and cultural discourses, and its very existence as a text all contribute to the way in which it engages with and affects the
			  world.
			- The poem is not simply a reflection of the world, nor is it a separate,
			  isolated object.
			- Rather, it is a part of the world, and it has effects on the world
			  through the way in which it positions itself in relation to various discourses
			  and codes.
			- In this sense, we can see that literary texts are not simply passive
			  reflections of the world, but active agents that have the potential to do things
			  in and to the world.
		- **4.4**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Some of these points may become clear if we take a closer look at a few
			  details of Marvell’s poem. The poem explicitly plays upon an opposition
			  between text and world. It begins by claiming that if there were ‘world enough,
			  and time’, the speaker would spend many hundreds of years praising the
			  woman’s beauty. Thus the opening verse-paragraph immediately establishes
			  an opposition between words and deeds, between talking and making love,
			  between language and the body – between the text and the world. And, in a
			  self-consuming rhetorical gesture, the poem argues against any more discourse,
			  any more talk. It argues for the disposal or rejection of speech in favour
			  of action – the action of the joining of two bodies. In this sense, the whole
			  poem may be read in terms of a conflict played out between the text and the
			  world, an attempt to go beyond its own discourse to the body of the woman. At
			  the same time, however, and paradoxically, the poem appears to suggest that
			  this separation of text and world is itself impossible. The poem culminates in
			  a rejection of speech or discourse and in a militaristic metaphor for the violent
			  exchange between two bodies (‘Let us roll all our strength, and all / Our sweetness,
			  up into one ball: / And tear our pleasures with rough strife / Thorough
			  the iron gates of life’). But this final rejection of speech in favour of action
			  simply results in silence, the end of the poem: it does not, cannot, go beyond
			  talk to the body of the woman. For the speaker, there is no escape from talk,
			  language, discourse, no pure body without, outside of, this poem.
			  Nevertheless, at various points in the poem, the speaker does attempt to
			  point beyond language, to refer to the woman’s body – here and now. At the
			  beginning of the third verse-paragraph, for example, he describes a blush
			  which suffuses the woman’s body:
			  Now, therefore, while the youthful hue
			  Sits on thy skin like morning dew,
			  And while thy willing soul transpires
			  At every pore with instant fires,
			  Now let us sport us while we may . . .
			  What we might call the poem’s ‘fiction of immediacy’ (the sense that the
			  speaker is addressing a woman who is present and that the action of this poem
			  takes place in ‘real time’) becomes fully apparent at this point, when the
			  speaker refers directly to the altering state of the woman’s body. In addition to the insistent deixis of ‘Now . . . Now’, this sense of immediacy is generated
			  through complex rhetorical strategies. For example, the blush or sweat which
			  ‘transpires / At every pore’ is read as a sign of the inner ‘fires’ produced by the
			  ‘willing soul’ of the woman. In its most direct reference to the woman’s body,
			  at this ‘instant’, here and now, the poem is highly figurative. The complicated
			  metaphoricity of these lines, their sheer insistent textuality, dissolves any
			  illusion of corporeal presence. Moreover, as we have suggested, the speaker
			  interprets the woman’s blush just as we interpret his lines. The fiction of
			  immediacy in Marvell’s poem, the reiterated force of the ‘now’, is derived
			  above all perhaps from the extraordinary turn that occurs at the start of the
			  second verse-paragraph: ‘But at my back I always hear / Time’s wingèd chariot
			  hurrying near’. This ‘always’ evokes the constant imminence of something,
			  an unceasing urgency and apprehension that is always there, always ‘hurrying
			  near’, regardless of whether we are reading or making love, writing or fighting.
		- 4.4.1
			- Marvell’s poem ‘To His Coy Mistress’ uses the opposition between text and world to explore the relationship between language and the body.
			- The poem sets up an opposition between words and deeds, and between talking and making love.
			- At the same time, however, the poem suggests that this separation of text and world is impossible.

			- There is no escape from talk, language, discourse, no pure body without, outside of, this poem.
			- Despite this, the speaker attempts to point beyond language to refer to the woman’s body.
			- The sense of immediacy is generated through complex rhetorical strategies and metaphors, which dissolve any illusion of corporeal presence.
			- The constant imminence of time’s winged chariot evokes a sense of urgency and apprehension that is always there, regardless of whether we are reading or making love, writing or fighting.
			- Ultimately, the poem suggests that language is inextricably bound up with the body and with the world, and that there is no escape from the mediation of language in human experience.

		  collapsed:: true
			- ‘The text and the world’ names a false opposition. Texts cannot but be part
			  of the world. To talk about texts as ‘representing’ reality simply overlooks ways
			  in which texts are already part of that reality, and ways in which literary texts
			  produce our reality, make our worlds. In this respect we may be prompted to
			  ask what is at stake not only in the narrator’s but in Marvell’s and in Western
			  culture’s representations of the female body. In particular, we might ask what
			  is involved in the violence embedded within Marvell’s figuration of the woman
			  as a body and as dead – as a corpse. What is the relationship between aesthetic
			  and erotic contemplation in this representation on the one hand and its imagining
			  of the woman’s death on the other? In her influential book Over Her
			  Dead Body: Death, Femininity and the Aesthetic (1992), Elisabeth Bronfen
			  has explored the multiple ways in which patriarchy figures the conjunction of
			  femininity with death and the aesthetic, and the fact that the female body as
			  an object of aesthetic contemplation is also bound up with a certain violence
			  towards femininity, towards women. According to this thinking, the very status
			  of Marvell’s poem as a classic, as a showcase poetic urn in the imaginary
			  museum of English literary history, its reproduction in classrooms, lecture
			  theatres, anthologies and in books such as our own, produces and reinforces
			  the cultural construction of ‘woman’ as allied with death and with the aesthetic.
			  Indeed, Bronfen would argue that such a poem and its reception have
			  a crucial social and cultural function since, like other representations of the
			  death of a beautiful woman, the poem exemplifies patriarchy’s repression of
			  the fact of the (male) subject’s own death by the displaced representation of
			  that death in the ‘other’ (the woman). The linguist Roman Jakobson famously
			  defines the ‘poetic function’ of language as ‘a focus on the message for its own
			  sake’ (Jakobson 1960, 365), and the critical tradition has tended to respond to Marvell’s poem in just this way, reading it as a self-reflexive, autonomous work
			  of art which transcends the interests of the world. But if instead we read it as a
			  powerful and influential expression of the cultural construction of femininity,
			  we see that the distinction that is embedded in our chapter title – between the
			  text and the world – has dissolved.
		- 4.5.1
			- The opposition between "the text and the world" is false because literary texts are already a part of reality and shape our understanding of the world.
			- When we view texts as simply "representing" reality, we overlook the ways in which they actively participate in the construction of our reality.
			- The representation of the female body in Marvell's poem raises important questions about the relationship between aesthetic contemplation and violence towards women.
			- Elisabeth Bronfen's book, Over Her Dead Body: Death, Femininity and the Aesthetic, examines how patriarchy often associates femininity with death and the aesthetic, and how the cultural construction of "woman" as allied with death is reinforced by the reproduction of classic works like Marvell's poem in classrooms, anthologies, and literary histories.
			- This poem, along with other representations of the death of a beautiful woman, exemplifies patriarchy's repression of the male subject's own mortality by displacing it onto the female "other."
			- While some have approached Marvell's poem as a self-reflexive work of art that transcends worldly interests, a feminist reading reveals it as a powerful expression of cultural constructions of femininity that blur the boundary between the text and the world.

			  Edward Said’s The World, the Text, and the Critic (1983), especially the title

			  is contained in the work of Raymond Williams, whose 1961 book The Long
			  Revolution (1992) has been deeply influential for British cultural materialism
			  in particular. Roland Barthes’s classic book Mythologies (1972) demonstrates

	- ### 5 The Uncanny
	  collapsed:: true
		- **5.1**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Literature is uncanny. What does this mean? To try to define the uncanny
			  is immediately to encounter one of its decisive paradoxes, namely that
			  it has to do with a troubling of definitions, with a fundamental disturbance of
			  what we think and feel. The uncanny has to do with a sense of strangeness,
			  mystery or eeriness. More particularly it concerns a sense of unfamiliarity
			  which appears at the very heart of the familiar, or else a sense of familiarity
			  which appears at the very heart of the unfamiliar. The uncanny is not just a
			  matter of the weird or spooky, but has to do more specifically with a disturbance
			  of the familiar. Such a disturbance might be hinted at by way of the
			  word ‘familiar’ itself. ‘Familiar’ goes back to the Latin familia, a family: we all
			  have some sense of how odd families can seem (whether or not one is ‘part of
			  the family’). The idea of ‘keeping things in the family’ or of something that
			  ‘runs in the family’, for instance, is at once familiar and potentially secretive or
			  strange. As an adjective ‘familiar’ means ‘well acquainted or intimate’, ‘having
			  a thorough knowledge’, etc., but as a noun it carries the more unsettling,
			  supernatural sense of ‘a spirit or demon supposed to come to a person esp a
			  witch, etc, at his or her call’ (Chambers Dictionary). We might think here, for
			  example, of the demonic ‘familiar’ that is said to haunt Bertha Mason in
			  Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre (1847) or, more comically, of the 12-year-old
			  Maud’s ‘supernatural companion’ in Elizabeth Bowen’s superb novel A World
			  of Love (1955).
			  Here are a couple of examples of the uncanny. First: you walk into a room in
			  a house you have never visited before and suddenly you have the sense that
			  you have been there before and that you even seem to know what will happen
			  next. This kind of experience has even developed its own name, déjà vu. Or,
			  second example: you are in some public place (a shop perhaps or a train) and you catch sight of someone whom you think looks rather disturbing, and then
			  you realize that you have caught sight of this person reflected in a window or a
			  mirror and that this person is yourself.
		- 5.1.1
			- The concept of the uncanny is difficult to define, as it involves a sense of unfamiliarity or eeriness within the familiar.
			- It is not just a matter of the weird or spooky, but rather a disturbance of the familiar that challenges our perceptions and expectations.
			- This paradoxical experience of the uncanny can be illustrated by examples such as déjà vu or the unsettling feeling of seeing oneself reflected in a window or mirror.
			- The word "familiar" itself, which has both a common and supernatural connotation, also hints at the uncanny's unsettling nature.
			- In literature, the uncanny often manifests through themes such as repetition, animism, automatism, and ghosts, and is intimately tied to language and the sense of a crisis in relation to it.
		- **5.2**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The uncanny has to do with making things uncertain: it has to do with
			  the sense that things are not as they have come to appear through habit and
			  familiarity, that they may challenge all rationality and logic. Let us nevertheless
			  suggest thirteen (unlucky!) forms that the uncanny can take:
			  1. Repetition. For example, strange repetition of a feeling, situation, event
			  or character. Two obvious examples of the uncanny, in this respect,
			  would be the experience of déjà vu (the sense that something has happened
			  before), and the idea of the double (or doppelgänger).
			  2. Odd coincidences and, more generally, the sense that things are fated to
			  happen. Something might happen, for example, that seems ‘too good to
			  be true’ or that suggests, despite the fact that you do not believe in God,
			  that someone or something is pulling the strings.
			  3. Animism. This is the rhetorical term referring to a situation in which what
			  is inanimate or lifeless is given attributes of life or spirit. In the last sentence
			  of Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights (1847), for example, we read
			  of ‘the soft wind breathing through the grass’ – a potentially uncanny
			  instance of animism.
		- 5.2.1
			- The uncanny refers to a sense of strangeness and mystery that challenges our sense of familiarity and logic.
			- It can take various forms, such as strange repetition, odd coincidences, and animism, where inanimate objects are given attributes of life or spirit.

			- 2. Deja Vu, Foreshadowing
			- 3. Animism
		- **5.3**
		  collapsed:: true
			- 4. Anthropomorphism – that is to say, a more specific (because specifically
			  human) form of animism. It is the rhetorical figure that refers to a situation
			  in which what is not human is given attributes of human form or shape:
			  the legs of a table or the face of a cliff would be examples of anthropomorphism,
			  though they might not immediately or necessarily provoke a
			  feeling of uncanniness. In a similar fashion, children’s toys and fairy tales
			  present many possibilities for thinking about anthropomorphism: we
			  may think of such things (dolls or household utensils coming to life and
			  talking) as decidedly not uncanny, but there is perhaps also a strange,
			  potential slipperiness here. It is perhaps not by chance that children
			  and children’s toys loom large in certain books and films about the supernatural.
			  (A fairy tale is not as far from a horror story as we might initially
			  suppose.) An uncanny story frequently involves a mingling of such
			  elements. It is crucial to the strange and disturbing atmosphere of
			  Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s story The Yellow Wallpaper (1892) that the
			  room in which the narrator is confined is a former children’s nursery.
			  More immediately and more obviously uncanny, however, would be the
			  anthropomorphic character of the wallpaper in this room. There is, for
			  example, the moment when the narrator tells us about the ‘kind of subpattern’
			  in the wallpaper: ‘in the places where [the wallpaper] isn’t faded
			  and where the sun is just so – I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort
			  of figure, that seems to skulk about behind’ (18).
			  5. Automatism. This is a term that can be used when what is human is perceived
			  as merely mechanical: examples of this would be sleepwalking,
			  epileptic fits, trance-states and madness. The narrator of The Yellow
			  Wallpaper would clearly fit into this category (especially when she is
			  ‘creeping’ round and round her room at the end), but a sufficiently careful
			  reading of, say, Keats’s trance-like ‘Ode to a Nightingale’ (1819) might
			  also prove interesting in this context. The question at the end of Keats’s
			  poem is about trance and, perhaps, madness. In a sense it is a question
			  that haunts literature in general: ‘Do I wake or sleep?’ To suggest briefly one other example, the writing of D.H. Lawrence is full of people in states
			  of trance and seizure. Towards the end of ‘The Rocking-Horse Winner’
			  (1912), for instance, there is a description of Paul and his mother: ‘The
			  Derby was drawing near, and the boy grew more and more tense. He
			  hardly heard what was spoken to him, he was very frail, and his eyes were
			  really uncanny. His mother had sudden seizures of uneasiness about him’
			  (745). Robots and other automata (such as Terminator), on the other
			  hand, are also potentially uncanny, for the opposite reason: what is
			  perceived as human is in fact mechanical.

			- Anthropomorphism refers to giving non-human things human-like attributes, such as toys or household items coming to life and talking. Automatism, on the other hand, is when human behavior is perceived as mechanical or automatic, such as sleepwalking or madness.
			- The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman is an example of the uncanny through anthropomorphism, as the wallpaper in the room where the narrator is confined takes on a strange and disturbing character.

			- 6. A sense of radical uncertainty about sexual identity – about whether a
			  person is male or female, or apparently one but actually the other. This is
			  made dramatically clear, for instance, in the uncanny revelation in the
			  course of Neil Jordan’s film The Crying Game (1992), when an apparently
			  female character turns out to have the genitalia of a man; but we could also
			  think of the uncanniness of gender in, for example, Virginia Woolf ’s
			  Orlando (1927), Jeanette Winterson’s Sexing the Cherry (1989) and
			  Written on the Body (1992), and Jeffrey Eugenides’s Middlesex (2002).
			  7. A fear of being buried alive. This may seem a somewhat refined example
			  of the uncanny, but it is relevant insofar as it is related more broadly
			  to images or experiences of claustrophobia, of being unexpectedly and
			  unpleasantly stuck (for instance in an elevator, or in a swamp, or simply in
			  a room with the last person in the world you would like to be left alone
			  with). An extreme but fascinating instance of the uncanny in this context
			  would be Edgar Allan Poe’s story ‘The Premature Burial’ (1844) – about
			  a man who has an obsessive fear of being buried alive and goes to great
			  trouble and expense to have his family crypt designed in such a way as to
			  allow him to escape, in the (one might have thought laughably unlikely)
			  event of being buried alive by mistake. In a broader sense, however, we
			  could reflect on the uncanny feelings encountered in all the aspects of
			  being locked in, of enclosure and confinement, in Brontë’s intensely
			  claustrophobic Wuthering Heights or in Tennyson’s short but extraordinarily
			  evocative poem ‘Mariana’ (1830).
			  8. Silence. Intriguingly, this is an example proposed by Freud, though
			  he himself is effectively silent on the subject of what makes it uncanny.
			  The potentially uncanny qualities of silence are particularly evident in
			  a work such as Henry James’s The Turn of the Screw (1898). There is,
			  for example, the strangely silent encounter on the stairs, between the
			  governess and the dead Peter Quint:
			  It was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close quarters that gave
			  the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a place and at such an hour we still at least
			  would have spoken. Something would have passed, in life, between us;
			  if nothing had passed one of us would have moved. The moment was
			  so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make me doubt
			  if even Iwere in life. I can’t express what followed it save by saying that
			  the silence itself . . . became the element into which I saw the figure
			  disappear. (135)
		- 5.4.1
			- To continue the list of forms that the uncanny can take:
			  6. A sense of radical uncertainty about sexual identity can be uncanny, as depicted in literature such as Virginia Woolf’s Orlando (1927) or Jeffrey Eugenides’s Middlesex (2002).
			- The fear of being buried alive or of claustrophobia, as seen in Edgar Allan Poe’s story “The Premature Burial” (1844), or in the confinement depicted in Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights or Tennyson’s poem “Mariana” (1830).
			- Silence can also be an uncanny element in literature, as seen in Henry James’s The Turn of the Screw (1898) with the strangely silent encounter between the governess and the dead Peter Quint.
		- **5.5**
		  collapsed:: true
			- 9. Telepathy. This is an uncanny idea not least because it involves the
			  thought that your thoughts are perhaps not your own, however private
			  or concealed you might have assumed them to be. Literature is pervaded
			  by examples of the telepathic. Alongside some of the texts already mentioned,
			  such as Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, ‘The Rocking-Horse
			  Winner’ and The Turn of the Screw, we might think, for instance, of
			  George Eliot’s The Lifted Veil (1878) – the very title of which gestures
			  towards uncanny relevation. Eliot’s narrator, Latimer, describes how he
			  suddenly becomes capable of reading others’ thoughts. In this way he
			  presents an uncanny example of one of the most fundamental characteristics
			  of narrative fiction: he becomes a telepathic narrator.
			  10. Death. In particular, death as something at once familiar – ‘all that lives
			  must die’, as Gertrude puts it (Hamlet, I, ii, 72) – and absolutely unfamiliar,
			  unthinkable, unimaginable. As the Anglican Book of Common Prayer
			  declares: ‘In life we are in the midst of death.’
			  11. The death drive. This term, initially deriving from Sigmund Freud’s
			  remarkable essay of 1920, ‘Beyond the Pleasure Principle’ (Freud 1984),
			  refers to the idea that everyone at some level (consciously or unconsciously)
			  is driven by a desire to die, to self-destruct, to return to a state of
			  inanimacy. By a sort of uncanny reversal or displacement of perspective,
			  then, life would not be about living, progressing and developing, about
			  pleasure, vitality and staying healthy. Instead, and without our even
			  necessarily realizing it, life is about what W. B Yeats calls the ‘longing
			  for the tomb’ (Yeats 1977), in other words an uncannily strange return
			  or recurrence (the desire to return to non-being, the desire not to be).
			  Literature is packed with examples. We might think, once again, of
			  Wuthering Heights, ‘The Rocking-Horse Winner’, ‘Ode to a Nightingale’,
			  ‘Mariana’ or, of course, Hamlet.
			  12. Ghosts. In some ways, perhaps, this is the uncanny par excellence. The
			  notion of the ghost unsettles all distinctions between being alive and
			  being dead, the real and the unreal, the familiar and the unfamiliar. A
			  ghost is the very embodiment of strange repetition or recurrence: it is a
			  revenant, it comes back. (For more on this particular form of uncanniness,
			  see Chapter 18.)
			  13. Language. The word ‘uncanny’ is singular: it is not just a case of something
			  being ‘weird’, ‘spooky’, or ‘eerie’. An uncanny feeling or experience
			  is intimately bound up with language, and more particularly perhaps
			  with a kind of crisis in relation to language. We call it ‘uncanny’ but we are
			  also rather at a loss, we experience uncertainty, we encounter (however
			  fleetingly) the sense of something beyond language, unnamable.
		- 5.5.1
			- The tenth form of the uncanny listed in the text is death, which is familiar and yet also unfamiliar and unimaginable.
			- The text refers to the Book of Common Prayer, which states that "in life we are in the midst of death."
			- The idea of death is a fundamental theme in literature, as it touches on the inevitability of our own mortality and our own uncertain fate after death.
			- Examples of this theme in literature include Hamlet, where the eponymous character grapples with his own mortality and the meaning of life, and "Mariana" by Tennyson, which evokes a sense of despair and melancholy by describing the decay and decay of a landscape.
			- The eleventh form of the uncanny listed in the text is the death drive, which refers to the idea that everyone, consciously or unconsciously, is driven by a desire to return to a state of inanimacy, to self-destruct, or to die.
			- This desire for self-annihilation is a central concept in Freud's essay "Beyond the Pleasure Principle."
			- The text suggests that literature is full of examples of this theme, such as "Wuthering Heights," "The Rocking-Horse Winner," "Ode to a Nightingale," and "Mariana." In each of these works, characters are driven to self-destructive behavior or have a fascination with death, highlighting the uncanny idea that life is not about living, progressing, and developing, but rather about the longing for the tomb.
			- Ghosts - This form of the uncanny is described as the par excellence. The notion of a ghost challenges the distinction between being alive and being dead, blurring the lines between the real and the unreal, and the familiar and the unfamiliar.
			- A ghost is a representation of strange repetition or recurrence, as it is a revenant that returns. This form of the uncanny is extensively explored in literature, and the idea of a ghost is a significant element in many horror stories and tales.
			- Language - The concept of the uncanny is closely connected with language, and more specifically, with a crisis in relation to language.
			- The author explains that the term "uncanny" is singular, and it is not merely a case of something being eerie, spooky, or weird.
			- An experience of the uncanny is linked to a sense of something beyond language, which cannot be easily articulated or expressed. This could lead to a feeling of being at a loss or experiencing uncertainty. The relationship between language and the uncanny is significant, as it is through language that we attempt to define and understand our experiences, yet the uncanny remains a concept that cannot be fully grasped through language alone.

			- In sum, then, the uncanny can be described as the thoughts and feelings
			  that may arise on those occasions when the homely becomes unhomely,
			  when the familiar becomes uncomfortably strange or the unfamiliar becomes
			  strangely familiar. Alternatively, the uncanny is – in the words of the German
			  philosopher F.W.J. Schelling – that which ‘ought to have remained . . . secret
			  and hidden but has come to light’. Schelling’s definition of the uncanny is
			  quoted by Sigmund Freud in his essay, published in 1919, entitled ‘The
			  “Uncanny” ’ (‘Das Unheimliche’). In fact, most of the account of the uncanny
			  which we have given so far is indebted to this extraordinary text. When Freud
			  chose to write an essay on the uncanny he was opening up a very strange can
			  of worms.
			  Freud’s essay is largely focused on literature and in particular on a reading
			  of E.T.A. Hoffmann’s story ‘The Sand-Man’ (1816). In this respect it
			  is slightly unusual, since Freud wrote comparatively little that could be
			  described as literary criticism or literary theory. But few of Freud’s essays have
			  had a more pervasive impact on literary studies. What is especially fascinating
			  about Freud’s essay is the way in which it prompts us to ask various questions
			  about boundaries and limits: How much of Freud’s essay is psychoanalysis
			  and how much is literature? Where does reason become imagination and
			  imagination reason? Where does science become fiction and fiction science?
			  Where does literature end and literary criticism or literary theory begin?
			  It has become something of a truism to note that Freud’s writings can be
			  thought about in at least two basic and quite different ways. First, there is the
			  Freud of the so-called popular imagination: Freud the patriarchal, bourgeois,
			  nineteenth-century Viennese Jew, who believed that everything has to do with
			  sex. This Freud has very firm views and spouts these in the form of rather
			  mechanically predictable theories, the most celebrated and fundamental
			  of which is perhaps the Oedipus complex. Second, however, there is the other
			  Freud, a Freud who did not fully realize what he was saying, who was for
			  various reasons (historical as much as personal) unable to see or develop the
			  implications of what he was saying, not least because these implications regularly
			  exceed or interfere with his own proposed themes and assumptions.
			  This second Freud is a Freud who is, we could say, different from himself, and who constitutes what is sometimes referred to as ‘the new Freud’ or ‘French
			  Freud’ (in acknowledgment of the work done by the French psychoanalyst
			  Jacques Lacan and others), a result in other words of what has been called ‘the
			  rereading of Freud’ or ‘the return to Freud’.
		- 5.6.1
			- The concept of the uncanny can be described as the experience of discomfort that arises when something familiar becomes unsettlingly strange, or when something unfamiliar becomes eerily familiar. This notion was introduced by German philosopher F.W.J. Schelling, and was further developed by Sigmund Freud in his essay "The 'Uncanny'".
			- In this essay, Freud examines E.T.A. Hoffmann's story "The Sand-Man" and its relation to the concept of the uncanny. Although Freud is primarily known for his contributions to psychoanalysis, his essay on the uncanny has had a significant impact on literary studies.
			- Freud's essay raises a number of questions regarding the boundaries between reason and imagination, science and fiction, and literature and literary criticism.
			- It is often noted that there are two distinct interpretations of Freud's work: the popular conception of Freud as a patriarchal, bourgeois, nineteenth-century Viennese Jew who believed that everything has to do with sex, and the more nuanced interpretation of Freud as a complex thinker whose ideas have been reinterpreted and developed in a variety of ways.
			- The latter interpretation of Freud has been referred to as the "new Freud" or "French Freud", and is the result of what has been called "the rereading of Freud" or "the return to Freud". This second Freud is one whose ideas are seen as having implications that he may not have fully realized, and whose work continues to be reinterpreted and developed by scholars today.
		- **5.7**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Freud’s ‘The “Uncanny” ’ provides one of the most dramatic and stimulating
			  manifestations of these two Freuds. On the one hand there is the Freud
			  who believes (and in some sense needs to believe) that literature and psychoanalysis
			  can be simply and clearly separated off from each other, and that
			  psychoanalysis can significantly contribute towards a scientific and objective
			  understanding of literary texts. On the other hand, there is the Freud who
			  shows (often only inadvertently) that the ‘literary’ is stranger and more
			  disturbing than psychoanalysis, science or rationalism in general may be able
			  or willing to acknowledge. The essay gives us two Freuds, or a kind of double-
			  Freud, and this double spends the essay investigating the importance among
			  other things of the idea of the double. What makes the double uncanny?
			  According to Freud’s essay, the double is paradoxically both a promise of
			  immortality (look, there’s my double, I can be reproduced, I can live forever)
			  and a harbinger of death (look, there I am, no longer me here, but there: I am
			  about to die, or else I must be dead already). The notion of the double undermines
			  the very logic of identity.
			  All of this is suggested, in fact, by the English title of Freud’s essay, where
			  the word ‘uncanny’ is in quotation marks. This putting-into-quotation-marks
			  itself constitutes potential breeding grounds for the uncanny – for the ‘uncanny’
			  is in a sense always in quotation marks. The uncanny might thus be
			  thought of as a kind of ghost-effect that haunts all words, however self-evident
			  or ‘familiar’ they may appear to be. We could illustrate this most easily perhaps
			  by trying to imagine what it would be like if proper names (such as ‘London’,
			  ‘Hillary Clinton’, ‘God’) were suddenly used only in quotation marks – thus
			  giving a new sense to the phrase ‘scare quotes’. Language itself, then, becomes
			  uncanny. Indeed, very often the more familiar a word, the more uncanny it
			  can become. Every ‘word’, for example, is capable of being put into quotation
			  marks and the act of putting it into quotation marks makes that word a little
			  strange, as if different from itself, referring to something or somewhere else.
			  This is a general point, also, about repetition: repetition of a word (‘Words,
			  words, words’, as Hamlet says) can give rise to a sense of hollowness,
			  strangeness, even spookiness.
			  Repetition is a key aspect of the uncanny, as Freud’s essay makes clear. The
			  uncanny is not simply a matter of the mysterious, bizarre or frightening: as
			  we have tried to suggest, it involves a kind of duplicity (both doubling and
			  deception) within the familiar. This logic of the uncanny, whereby the familiar turns into, or becomes contaminated by, the unfamiliar, is evident in the word
			  ‘uncanny’ (or, in German, ‘unheimlich’) itself. ‘Uncanny’ is the opposite of
			  ‘canny’, meaning ‘skilful’, ‘shrewd’, ‘knowing’ (from Old English kunnan,
			  ‘to know’, especially in the sense ‘to know how to be able to do something’).
			  But the word ‘canny’ shades into its opposite: in Scottish English in particular,
			  ‘canny’ can suggest unnatural or excessive skilfulness, shrewdness or
			  knowing. This capacity for a word to contain or to turn into its opposite
			  is what Freud elsewhere talks about as the ‘antithetical’ meanings of ‘primal
			  words’ (see Freud 1957a). We consider another example of this in Chapter 30,
			  where ‘pleasure’ can be seen – at least in certain contexts – to entail its opposite
			  (‘pain’). Masochism is the term conventionally used to gloss this contradictory
			  logic according to which pain can be pleasure or pleasure pain.
		- 5.7.1
			- In his essay "The 'Uncanny'", Sigmund Freud explores the concept of the uncanny, which refers to the unsettling feeling that arises when the familiar becomes uncomfortably strange or when the unfamiliar becomes strangely familiar.
			- Freud's essay is focused primarily on literature and is centered around a reading of E.T.A. Hoffmann's story "The Sand-Man". The essay investigates the importance of the idea of the double, which is paradoxically both a promise of immortality and a harbinger of death.
			- Freud argues that the uncanny is characterized by a kind of duplicity within the familiar and is evident in the very word "uncanny" itself, which is the opposite of "canny".
			- He also notes that language itself can become uncanny, particularly through repetition, and that words can contain or turn into their opposites.
			- Freud's essay presents two different perspectives on the relationship between literature and psychoanalysis, and prompts questions about the boundaries and limits of reason, imagination, science, and fiction.

		  collapsed:: true
			- Analysis of the word ‘uncanny’ seems ineluctably, even fatalistically, bound
			  up with an experience of the uncanny, an experience which disturbs any
			  attempt to remain analytically detached and objective. This is strikingly clear
			  from the early pages of Freud’s essay, in which he seeks to show how the
			  German word for ‘homely’ (‘heimlich’), with its connotations of ‘private’,
			  ‘hidden’, ‘secret’, inevitably conceals its opposite – the ‘unhomely’ or unheimlich.
			  From this it may be concluded that the uncanny cannot readily be
			  avoided or denied: ultimately, the uncanny is aligned with death. As a form of
			  strange disruption, questioning and uncertainty, the idea of the uncanny may
			  be frightening, but it also continues to be a crucially important and productive
			  area for literary study.
			  The uncanny, then, is an experience – even though this may have to do with
			  the unthinkable or unimaginable. It is not a theme which a writer uses or
			  which a text possesses. The uncanny is not something simply present like
			  an object in a painting. It is, rather, an effect. In this respect it has to do with
			  how we read or interpret (interestingly, it makes no difference here whether
			  we are talking about something in a book or something in the so-called outside
			  world). In other words, the uncanny has to do, most of all, with effects of
			  reading, with the experience of the reader. The uncanny is not so much in the
			  text we are reading: rather, it is like a foreign body within ourselves.

			- In this final section, the text concludes that the idea of the uncanny is intrinsically linked to an experience that cannot be avoided or denied.
			- The analysis of the word itself reveals its connotations of disruption and uncertainty, ultimately aligned with death.
			- The uncanny is not a theme used by a writer or present like an object in a painting, but rather an effect that has to do with how we read and interpret.
			- In this sense, the uncanny is an experience that is located within the reader themselves, a foreign body that disturbs and disrupts their sense of the familiar. Despite its potentially frightening aspects, the uncanny remains an important and productive area for literary study.

	- ### 6 Monuments
	  collapsed:: true
		- **6.1**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Thou art a monument without a tomb,
			  And art alive still while thy book doth live,
			  And we have wits to read, and praise to give.
			  Ben Jonson’s poem ‘To the Memory of My Beloved, The Author,
			  Mr. William Shakespeare, And What He Hath Left Us’ was originally
			  published as a preface to the First Folio edition of Shakespeare’s collected
			  plays in 1623, just seven years after the Bard’s death. In these lines Jonson
			  addresses the topic of this chapter: the nature of the literary monument
			  and the way in which the writings of living authors are posthumously transformed
			  into monuments to those authors’ lives and work. The poet is, in
			  Jonson’s seemingly paradoxical formulation, a ‘monument without a tomb’,
			  and is ‘alive still’ despite his death. The paradox that Jonson explores involves
			  the idea that the poet is both alive and dead: after his death the poet still ‘lives’
			  through the ‘life’ of his ‘book’, which itself lives just as long as we read it and
			  praise it. Exploring this paradox of the literary afterlife, the poem is performative.
			  It performs an act of monumentalization, since it is designed not only to
			  remind the reader of the value of Shakespeare’s work (the word ‘monument’,
			  we may remind ourselves, originates in the Latin monere, to remind) but also,
			  in so doing, to establish that value. In fact, the publishing venture to which
			  Jonson contributes his poem plays a crucial part in the monumentalization
			  of the poet: the publication of a posthumous ‘Collected Works’ is itself a sign
			  of the importance of the dead poet’s work, an index of his genius. Contrary
			  to Dryden’s sense that the poem was ‘an insolent, sparing, and invidious
			  panegyric’ (quoted in Donaldson 1988, 718), Jonson’s intention seems to
			  have been to ‘honour’ Shakespeare. This is the first stage in the poet’s transcendence of his time and in his establishment as a ‘classic’. Shakespeare
			  ‘was not of an age’, Jonson asserts, ‘but for all time!’ (l.43).
			  The Second Folio of Shakespeare’s plays, published nine years later
			  in 1632, included an anonymous sixteen-line poem (written in fact by
			  John Milton) entitled ‘An Epitaph on the Admirable Dramatic Poet, W.
			  Shakespeare’. Like Jonson’s poem, Milton’s begins by remarking on the fact
			  that the poet had been buried in Stratford rather than, as might be thought
			  more appropriate, Westminster Abbey (where, as Jonson notes, Chaucer,
			  Spenser and Francis Beaumont are buried). Milton also plays on the opposition
			  of life and death in the idea that Shakespeare has built for himself a
			  ‘live-long monument’. But he develops Jonson’s notion of the relationship
			  between reading and monumentalization by exploring the idea that we,
			  readers, through our ‘wonder and astonishment’ at Shakespeare’s art, are
			  made ‘marble with too much conceiving’. For Milton, we ourselves are
			  monuments to the poet’s genius, his living tomb:
			  What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones
			  The labour of an age in piled stones,
			  Or that his hallowed relics should be hid
			  Under a star-ypointing pyramid?
			  Dear son of memory, great heir of fame,
			  What need’st thou such weak witness of thy name?
			  Thou in our wonder and astonishment
			  Hast built thyself a live-long monument.
			  For whilst to the shame of slow-endeavouring art,
			  Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart
			  Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book,
			  Those Delphic lines with deep impression took,
			  Then thou our fancy of itself bereaving,
			  Dost make us marble with too much conceiving;
			  And so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie,
			  That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.
		- 6.1.1
			- The poem "To the Memory of My Beloved, The Author, Mr. William Shakespeare, And What He Hath Left Us" by Ben Jonson and the anonymous poem "An Epitaph on the Admirable Dramatic Poet, W. Shakespeare" included in the Second Folio of Shakespeare's plays both deal with the nature of the literary monument and the posthumous transformation of an author's writings into a monument to their life and work.
			- Jonson's poem performs an act of monumentalization by reminding the reader of the value of Shakespeare's work and establishing that value.
			- The publication of a posthumous 'Collected Works' is also a sign of the importance of the dead poet's work and an index of his genius.
			- Milton's poem builds on Jonson's notion of the relationship between reading and monumentalization and explores the idea that readers, through their 'wonder and astonishment' at Shakespeare's art, are made 'marble with too much conceiving' and become monuments to the poet's genius, his living tomb.
		- **6.2**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Both Jonson and Milton, then, articulate a series of questions around the
			  idea of the monument, around the idea of the monumentalization of literary
			  texts. How does an author enter the ‘canon’? What is the relationship between
			  monumentalization and reading? Do literary texts become static, frozen into
			  their own tombs of eternity, or do they change with time and with each new
			  generation? What is at stake in the literary critical process of canonization
			  and monumentalization? What is gained and what lost? Literary texts, as the
			  epitaphs by Jonson and Milton suggest, are themselves places where such
			  questions are inaugurated, first posed and first pondered.
			  As we have seen, Jonson and Milton both express a certain ambivalence in
			  their sense of the value of the monument and the process of monumentalization.
			  They assert that Shakespeare needs no physical tomb, a structure that
			  is at once a reminder of life and signifier of death. The third and fourth lines
			  of Milton’s poem sneer at the idea that Shakespeare’s ‘hallowed relics should
			  be hid / Under a star-ypointing pyramid’. The lines suggest that the act of
			  remembering, of monumentalizing the poet, is also an act of hiding, disguising,
			  defacing him, and they remind us that this is precisely what we do when
			  we bury the dead: by burying them we honour them but at the same time
			  we hide them from sight, as if they are as much objects of terror and taboo
			  as they are of veneration and awe. As Jonson and Milton recognize, the
			  acts of monumentalization in which they are engaged when they write on
			  Shakespeare are also acts of burial. And it might be argued that we are engaged
			  in a similar dynamic whenever we read, talk and write about literary texts – not
			  least, of course, when we write works of literary criticism. As Paul de Man
			  has argued in an essay on Shelley, the transformation of literary texts into ‘historical
			  and aesthetic objects’ involves a certain burial of those texts: what we
			  do with dead poets, he remarks, ‘is simply to bury them, to bury them in their
			  own texts made into epitaphs and monumental graves’ (de Man 1984, 121).
			  The impulse to honour the dead, that is to say, is at the same time an impulse
			  to bury them, to do away with them, to forget them, to be done with them.
			  This, it might be said, is the fundamental tension of the institution of literary
			  studies, an irreducible conflict between at once remembering and forgetting
			  the dead.
			  The paradox is broached rather differently in Frank Kermode’s The Classic
			  (1975), a book that has itself become a minor classic in discussions of literary
			  value, the canon and the nature of the institutionalization of literature.
			  Kermode comments on the tension between endurance and changeability that
			  constitutes the canon: ‘the books we call classic possess intrinsic qualities that
			  endure, but possess also an openness to accommodation which keeps them
			  alive under endlessly varying dispositions’ (Kermode 1975, 44). Just as
			  Jonson defines Shakespeare as ‘not of an age but for all time’, so Kermode is
			  attempting to think about the way that such a text or such an oeuvre ‘speaks’ to
			  all generations and is as such ‘timeless’. But he also suggests that it can only
			  be ‘timeless’ by signifying differently at different times, so that it is, as such,
			  time-bound. For Kermode, it is the possibility of a certain ‘openness’ to interpretation,
			  what he terms the text’s ‘accommodation’, which allows what we
			  call a ‘classic’ to survive. Kermode evokes a sense of the classic as the living
			  dead, surviving endlessly on or in new readers. His account has certain
			  implications for notions of authorial intention and for ideas about the limits
			  of interpretation: if a literary text can be read and reread at different times,
			  in accordance with their varying (conscious and unconscious) interests,
			  prejudices, ideas and conventions, then it would seem that the text cannot be
			  limited to a single or univocal interpretation. If this position is correct,
			  Kermode comments, we must somehow ‘cope with the paradox that the
			  classic changes, yet retains its identity’. And this has the further consequence
			  that the text must be ‘capable of saying more than its author meant’, even if it
			  were the case that saying ‘more than he meant was what he meant to do’.
			  Strange as it might seem, a ‘classic’ author may have meant what he or she cannot
			  have known that he or she meant. Ultimately, Kermode suggests, ‘the text
			  is under the absolute control of no thinking subject’ and is ‘not a message from
			  one mind to another’ (Kermode 1975, 80, 139).

			- The notion of the literary monument and the process of monumentalization is a complex and paradoxical one, as explored by both Ben Jonson and John Milton in their poems commemorating William Shakespeare.
			- Their ambivalence towards the idea of the monument raises questions about the relationship between monumentalization and reading, the role of the critic in the canonization process, and the tension between remembering and forgetting the dead.
			- Paul de Man argues that the institutionalization of literature involves burying the dead poets in their own texts, transforming them into objects of remembrance and forgetting simultaneously.
			- On the other hand, Frank Kermode proposes that the classic is a living dead, possessing intrinsic qualities that endure while also remaining open to interpretation and signifying differently at different times.
			- For Kermode, the classic must be capable of saying more than its author meant, and the text is not a message from one mind to another.
			- Ultimately, the literary monument and the process of monumentalization are complex and contradictory concepts, involving both commemoration and burial, endurance and changeability, and the tension between authorial intention and the limits of interpretation.

			- These ideas about the canon, about literary survival and about the nature
			  of the ‘classic’, bring us back to questions of meaning, interpretation and
			  authorial intention which we address elsewhere in this book. But here we are
			  also concerned with another question, one that is equally fundamental to this
			  book and to the practice and discipline of literary criticism more generally:
			  the question of literary value. Readers will no doubt have noticed the way in
			  which Bennett and Royle repeatedly employs terms of valuation: we refer, for
			  example, to Milton’s ‘great epic poem’ in Chapter 1, to Elizabeth Bowen’s
			  ‘superb’ novel in Chapter 5, to the opening paragraph of Middlemarch as
			  ‘extraordinary’ in Chapter 8, to Sheridan’s The School for Scandal as ‘one
			  of the greatest eighteenth-century English comedies’ in Chapter 12. We also
			  repeatedly use such terms as ‘haunting’, ‘powerful’, ‘disturbing’, ‘singular’ to
			  suggest our positive valuation of texts, and seem to ascribe value, more or less
			  explicitly, to aspects of texts that we see as funny, complex, undecidable,
			  unsettling, and so on. In other words, Bennett and Royle, like any other work
			  of literary criticism or theory, is benetted and embroiled in value judgements.
			  This situation is unavoidable: even if we were to exclude value-laden terms
			  from our critical vocabulary, we (have to) choose certain texts to read and talk
			  about and such choices can in themselves be taken to imply judgements of
			  value. Indeed, it may be said that the primary aim of critical discourse, the
			  impulse for talking about books, is to persuade someone else to appreciate
			  what the critic finds valuable about a literary text.
			  The bases on which judgements about literary value are made, however,
			  are not easy to define. One of the most intriguing things about T.S. Eliot’s classic
			  essay ‘What is a Classic?’ (1945) is the way that he repeatedly uses the word
			  ‘mature’ as a kind of talisman to express what he sees as valuable in literary
			  texts. Indeed, for Eliot, in this essay at least, it amounts to the very definition
			  of a classic: ‘If there is one word on which we can fix, which will suggest
			  the maximum of what I mean by the term “a classic”, it is the word maturity’
			  (Eliot 1975, 116). He then goes on to use the words ‘mature’ (as adjective
			  and verb) and ‘maturity’ a total of 23 times in the same paragraph: ripeness
			  is certainly all, it would seem, as far as Eliot is concerned. Eliot’s essay
			  was written in 1944. He was 56 in that year, which might be one reason why
			  maturity seemed so attractive to him. It’s possible, of course, that four years of
			  world war also had some influence on this thinking – if only because maturity
			  was at a premium, so many of the young having died in battle. Either way,
			  it would seem strange now, in the twenty-first century, to find a critic so
			  confident about the values to be ascribed to the notion of ‘maturity’. In general,
			  it might be said, ‘mature’ is no longer part of the critical vocabulary of
			  value. And what strikes us now about Eliot’s use of the word is the fact that he
			  nowhere says what he means by it, what he means when he says that a literary
			  text is ‘mature’. We can all tell when a peach is ripe but can we tell a mature
			  poem from an immature one? What do we do with it – squeeze it? Is Shelley’s
			  Adonais mature? Is it more or less mature than Pope’s Essay on Man, or
			  Spenser’s Epithalamion, or Eliot’s TheWaste Land? Is maturity even seen as
			  valuable any more? As a critical term, ‘mature’ has become almost risible. And
			  yet, for Eliot, it is crucial to his project of exploring the notion of the ‘classic’
			  and to his concept of literary value. This is not to say that Eliot was foolish or
			  irresponsible in his terminology: rather, it exemplifies the fact that critical
			  vocabularies change over time while always being in any case somewhat
			  porous, unstable, contentious. In the eighteenth century, the vocabulary of
			  value included ideas of proportion, probability and propriety; the Romantics
			  developed a vocabulary of the sublime, imagination and originality; while
			  nearer to our time, the New Critics valued complexity, paradox, irony and
			  tension in poems, and postmodern critics valorize disjunction, fragmentation,
			  heteroglossia, aporia, decentring.
		- 6.3.1
			- The authors of this book acknowledge the challenge of defining literary value, a fundamental question in the practice of literary criticism.
			- While they recognize the use of value-laden terms in their own discourse, they also acknowledge the difficulty in defining the bases on which such judgments are made.
			- T.S. Eliot's essay "What is a Classic?" is an example of how a critic attempts to define literary value. For Eliot, "maturity" is a talismanic term that signifies the maximum of what he means by a classic.
			- However, Eliot's repeated use of the word does not provide a clear definition of what he means by "mature" and what makes a literary text mature. The critical vocabulary of value changes over time and varies between different schools of literary criticism.
			- While the eighteenth century valued proportion, probability, and propriety, the Romantics developed a vocabulary of the sublime, imagination, and originality. The New Critics valued complexity, paradox, irony, and tension, and postmodern critics valorize disjunction, fragmentation, heteroglossia, aporia, and decentring.

			- Alongside changes in critical vocabulary, there are changes in how literary
			  monuments are perceived and valued. The most obvious example would be
			  the reception of Shakespeare himself. While Jonson and Milton declared, very
			  soon after his death in 1616, that Shakespeare had earned a place in the literary
			  canon, in fact his reputation developed much more slowly and patchily
			  than this would suggest. Indeed, during much of the eighteenth century his
			  work was criticized as brilliant but faulty: he was seen as a poet of ‘nature’
			  rather than learning, and was faulted for his versification and diction, his endless
			  punning, his handling of plot and characterization, the improbability of
			  his narratives, for not obeying the unities of time and place, and so on (see
			  Vickers 1981, 1–86). It was only towards the end of the eighteenth century
			  that an unalloyed and arguably uncritical sense of Shakespeare’s monumental and timeless genius became commonplace. Indeed, throughout the eighteenth
			  and even into the nineteenth century his plays were regularly rewritten
			  to iron out his faults and make him more amenable to contemporary tastes.
			  Thus King Learwas never performed on the English stage in its original form
			  during the eighteenth century because its ending was held to be too gloomy –
			  a happier, more appropriate ending was written for it by Nahum Tate in 1681
			  and became the standard acting text. In the present day, the perception and
			  valuation of Shakespeare remains deeply indebted to the Romantic conception
			  of his work as sublime, even sacred. At the same time, this conception of
			  Shakespeare has undergone radical demystification and deconstruction in the
			  work of such critics as Terence Hawkes, Jonathan Dollimore, Joel Fineman,
			  Catherine Belsey, John Drakakis, Margreta de Grazia and others.
			  In recent years, much attention has been given to the construction of the
			  literary canon. In particular, critics have explored the ways in which the canon
			  is bound up with questions of education, class, economics, race, ethnicity,
			  colonization, sexual and gender difference, and so on. This has led to a largescale
			  reassessment of both the canon itself and how evaluations take place.
			  The notion of literary value as an inviolable essence has disintegrated. Our
			  sense of the apparently impersonal and autonomous realm of the aesthetic has
			  been irrevocably complicated. More than ever we are made aware of how far
			  our own individual judgements are subject to social, political and institutional
			  constraints. More than ever we are made aware of how far the canon is a fabrication.
			  Thus, for example, critics have devoted much energy in recent years
			  to discovering or rediscovering women writers and writers from different
			  racial and ethnic backgrounds whose work has been neglected. In the case of
			  women writers, it is often argued that such authors have been overlooked precisely
			  because they are women, since, with a few notable exceptions (Austen,
			  the Brontës, Woolf, Plath, for example), the patriarchal ethos of the literary
			  critical establishment has tended to efface or marginalize women’s writing in
			  general. The publication of such anthologies as Gilbert and Gubar’s Norton
			  Anthology of Literature by Women (1985), Roger Lonsdale’s Eighteenth-
			  Century Women Poets (1989), Andrew Ashfield’s Romantic Women Poets
			  (1995, 1998), and Angela Leighton and Margaret Reynolds’s Victorian
			  Women Poets: An Anthology (1995), have altered the shape of the canon in and
			  beyond the academy. More generally, what Elaine Showalter calls ‘gynocriticism’
			  and publishing ventures such as Virago and the Woman’s Press have
			  altered our literary historical maps by rediscovering numerous forgotten (or
			  never recognized) authors, and critics have devoted a great deal of energy to
			  the work of re-editing their writings, as well as to the critical, biblio- and
			  biographical tasks of new evaluations.
			  Such reassessments and rediscoveries force us to face a series of difficult
			  and complex questions concerning literary value and critical evaluation. Is
			  literary value eternal and unchanging or is it contingent and dependent on
			  readers and the institutions of criticism? Are we simply constructing new,
			  exclusive canons when we discover ‘neglected’ writers, or are we rethinking
			  the whole idea of ‘the canon’ and canonization? Is there such a thing as literary
			  value? If so, how can it be described and defined? What are we doing when we
			  make such judgements? Is there, as Steven Connor argues, an ‘imperative’ or
			  ‘necessity’ of value (Connor 1992, 8)?

		  collapsed:: true
			- The recent rethinking of the canon, then, involves both a reassessment of
			  which texts should be in the canon and a rethinking of the idea of the canon
			  itself. Such reassessments have hardly gone unchallenged. One of the most
			  stubbornly provocative challenges to what, in his view, has become the modern
			  critical orthodoxy, is Harold Bloom’s The Western Canon (1994). Bloom’s
			  ‘single aim’ is to ‘preserve poetry as fully and purely as possible’ against the
			  politicizing of what he calls the ‘school of resentment’. For Bloom, the school
			  of resentment is typified by those critics who argue that the literary critical
			  institution has valorized the work of ‘dead white males’ at the expense of the
			  work of marginalized writers – women, say, or Afro-Caribbeans or Hispanics
			  or gays or the working classes (Bloom 1994, 18). For these ‘resentful’ critics,
			  the work of criticism cannot be disengaged from the work of social and political
			  critique since the traditional canon operates as an ideological justification
			  of the values (often racist, heterosexist, patriarchal, colonial and elitist) of the
			  male, Western, establishment figures which it enshrines. For Bloom, by contrast,
			  literature is and should be an antisocial body of work. Literary texts, he
			  argues, even work against political and social improvement: indeed, for
			  Bloom, great writers ‘are subversive of all values’. Reading their work with a
			  view to forming our ‘social, political, or personal moral values’ would merely
			  make us ‘monsters of selfishness and exploitation’ (29). The canon, for Bloom,
			  is elitist and discriminatory or it is nothing. Accordingly, his book is itself
			  elitist. Bloom lists the 3,000 books and authors that he claims make up the
			  Western canon. He then narrows this down to 26 books/authors to which his
			  volume is devoted. In the final analysis, though, Bloom’s canon comes down
			  to a single author by whose work all else must be judged. We will not be
			  surprised by now to learn that that author is William Shakespeare. Bloom’s
			  argument for the Western canon relies, finally, on Shakespeare’s unique genius:
			  Shakespeare’s eminence is, I am certain, the rock upon which the School of
			  Resentment must at last founder. How can they have it both ways? If it is
			  arbitrary that Shakespeare centres the Canon, then they need to show why the dominant social class selected him rather than, say, Ben Jonson, for that
			  arbitrary role. Or if history and not the ruling circles exalted Shakespeare,
			  what was it in Shakespeare that so captivated the mighty Demiurge,
			  economic and social history? Clearly this line of inquiry begins to border on
			  the fantastic; how much simpler to admit that there is a qualitative difference,
			  a difference in kind, between Shakespeare and every other writer,
			  even Chaucer, even Tolstoy, or whoever. Originality is the great scandal
			  that resentment cannot accommodate, and Shakespeare remains the most
			  original writer we will ever know. (Bloom 1994, 25)
			  Bloom is compelling. The apparent continuity in the valuation of Shakespeare
			  from the eighteenth century to the present does indeed seem to validate such
			  a judgement of his work as a unique and uniquely original phenomenon, and
			  this is confirmed by what seems to be our instinctive sense on reading him that
			  we are encountering something original, unique, ‘for all time’. It is hard to get
			  round our sense, our intuitive sense, on reading Shakespeare, that his work is
			  simply, unquestionably richer, more complex, more endlessly fertile, than that
			  of other writers, even of other ‘canonical’ writers.
			  And yet, and yet . . . Still we might have nagging doubts. How do we know
			  that our ‘intuition’ is not itself a learned response, that our ‘instinctive’ sense
			  of Shakespeare’s genius is not, itself, a result of our schooling? If we see our
			  appreciation of Shakespeare as an effect of social conditioning, we might
			  feel that his work does not have the eternal qualities we thought it did.
			  Moreover, we might notice that Bloom’s ‘explanation’, his offering of the case
			  of Shakespeare as a final arbiter for his judgement about aesthetic judgement,
			  tells us nothing about the grounds for such claims: indeed, the questions that
			  Bloom poses for the ‘school of resentment’ might also be asked of his own
			  work, since his account of Shakespeare as different, as original and so on,
			  is no more an explanation than the ‘history’ or ‘class’ which his opponents
			  offer. Bloom’s is, finally (and proudly), a monumentalizing gesture: his very
			  language allies Shakespeare with the material of the tomb itself in its metaphor
			  of the ‘rock’, and eternalizes him and abstracts him from history in its comment
			  that he is ‘the most original writer we will ever know’. We are led back,
			  then, to the question with which we began this chapter: is that what we want of
			  our writers? Monuments?
		- 6.5.1
			- The concept of the literary canon is being rethought through a reassessment of which texts should be included and a rethinking of the idea of the canon itself.
			- Harold Bloom’s The Western Canon is a challenge to the modern critical orthodoxy, which he argues politicizes literary criticism by valorizing the work of ‘dead white males’ at the expense of marginalized writers. Bloom believes that literature should be an antisocial body of work that works against political and social improvement.
			- His argument for the Western canon relies on Shakespeare’s unique genius, which he views as a difference in kind that sets him apart from all other writers. While Bloom’s perspective is compelling, it raises questions about the learned nature of our appreciation of Shakespeare and the validity of our intuition that his work is richer, more complex, and more original than that of other writers.
			- Ultimately, Bloom’s approach is a monumentalizing gesture that raises the question of whether monuments are what we want from our writers.

			- It might seem ironic that what would appear to be the deeply conservative,
			  reactionary, elitist position of Harold Bloom should find confirmation in the
			  writings of that monument of socialism, Karl Marx. And yet Marx himself
			  affirms the sense that, as far as art goes, the crucial question is not how artists
			  reflect on or are influenced by their time but rather just the strange fact of their
			  survival: the difficulty lies not in understanding that the Greek arts and epic are
			  bound up with certain forms of social development. The difficulty is that
			  they still afford us artistic pleasure and that in a certain respect they count as
			  a norm and as an unattainable model. (Marx 1973, 111; Quoted in Guillory
			  1993, 322)
			  This, then, is what remains to be explained: the way that literary works
			  remain with us, haunt us, still, beyond the conditions of their production,
			  whatever may be our legitimate concerns for human and social justice. Just
			  this remaining, this endurance of the haunting singularity of the literary text, is
			  what keeps us coming back to it as our preoccupations, desires, prejudices
			  and commitments change. What baffles and enthrals – what Bloom is
			  responding to in his flawed but deeply productive defence of the canon – is
			  the singularity and uncanny force of the literary. It is this characterization
			  of Shakespeare as a ‘monument without a tomb’ – a monumentalizing and
			  anti-monumentalizing phrase – that Bloom shares with Jonson. And it is the
			  undecidable nature of such gestures, the sense that we bury poets as we raise
			  monuments of reading to them and our sense that, still, they hold over us an
			  uncanny, haunting power, which brings us to them, brings us back to them.

			- The passage discusses the recent rethinking of the literary canon, including reassessments of which texts should be included in it and a rethinking of the concept of the canon itself.

			- Bloom's argument for the Western canon is based on the unique genius of William Shakespeare, which he sees as a qualitative difference that makes Shakespeare the most original writer of all time.
			- However, the chapter questions whether such a monumentalizing gesture is what we want from our writers. The passage concludes with a discussion of Karl Marx's affirmation of the survival of literary works as a norm and an unattainable model, and the enduring power of the singularity and uncanny force of the literary.

			  stakes involved in how canons are formed and regarded. Barbara
			  Herrnstein Smith’s Contingencies of Value (1988) offers a persuasive proposal
			  for a pragmatic sense of literary value and the canon. John Guillory’s Cultural
			  Capital (1993) is a densely argued polemic for the ‘inevitability of the social
			  practice of judgement’ and of the inextricability of aesthetic and economic
			  ‘value’; Guillory is influenced by the work of the French sociologist Pierre

			  (1984) offers an important account of the social, cultural, economic and political
			  issues embedded in decisions about the value of literary and other works.

	- ### 7 Narrative

			- 7. Narrative Stories are everywhere: in movies, sitcoms, cartoons, commercials, poems, newspaper articles, novels, computer games and websites. We all make use of stories every day and our lives are shaped by stories – stories about what happened in our dreams or at the dentist, stories about how we fell in love or the origins of the universe, stories about war and about peace, stories to com- memorate the dead and to confirm a sense of who we are. In this chapter, we propose to circle around the following propositions: 1. Stories are everywhere. 2. Not only do we tell stories, but stories tell us: if stories are everywhere, we are also in stories. 3. The telling of a story is always bound up with power, with questions of authority, property and domination. 4. Stories are multiple: there is always more than one story. 5. Stories always have something to tell us about stories themselves: they always involve self-reflexive and metafictional dimensions. Roland Barthes suggests that falling in love involves telling ourselves stories about falling in love: in this sense, he argues, ‘mass culture is a machine for showing desire’ (Barthes 1990c, 136). Disagreements, arguments, even wars, are often the result of conflicting stories concerning, for example, the rights to a piece of land: the real reason for both the first Gulf War (1991) and the second Gulf War (2003–) may have been oil, but the technical justification for going to war turned on the story of who owned or should own a particular piece of Kuwait in the first instance and the existence or otherwise of weapons of mass destruction in the second. Academic, ‘objective’ or ‘scientific’Narrative 55 discourses are constructed as stories. The historian Hayden White has given special emphasis to the fact that history is written in the form of certain kinds of narrative, that the task of the historian is to ‘charge...events’ with ‘a com- prehensible plot structure’ (White 1978, 92). Science is composed of stories: astronomy attempts to narrate the beginnings of the universe; geology seeks to tell the story of the formation of mountains and plains, rivers, valleys and lakes; and like Rudyard Kipling’s Just So Stories, evolutionary psychology pur- ports to tell us the story of how we came to be as we are. For many centuries, millions of people have come to understandings about their place in the world, the meaning of their lives and the nature of politics, ethics and justice through stories about the lives of Christ, Buddha or the prophet Muhammad. The narrative of class struggle and emancipation from peasant society to the dicta- torship of the proletariat has had a profound influence in the past 150 years. And in the twentieth century, Sigmund Freud produced a new and scandalous story about the nature of childhood. To say that Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Marxism and psychoanalysis involve stories is not to suggest that they are merely fictive. Rather, it is to register the fact that there are few aspects of life which are not bound up with strategies and effects of narrative.

			- The simplest way to define narrative is as a series of events in a specific order – with a beginning, a middle and an end. We might think about James Joyce’s short story ‘The Dead’, from Dubliners(1914), to illustrate the point. Put very simply, the story begins with the arrival of Gabriel and his wife Gretta at a party, tells of the events of the party and the couple’s walk home, and ends as they fall asleep in their hotel. What is important in this description is the temporal ordering of what happens. By contrast, lyric poems, for example, are not typically thought to express or depict a series of temporally ordered series of events. One of the ways in which lyric poetry is defined, in fact, is by the absence of any such representation of events – lyric poems characteristically use the present tense and exploit a sense of the presence of the speaker in the act of meditating or speaking. Percy Bysshe Shelley’s ‘To a Sky-Lark’ (1820) recounts no events, but is an effusion of the poet’s sense of the bird’s ‘unpremeditated art’ which he attempts both to define and in some ways to reproduce. Similarly, while Seamus Heaney’s ‘bog poems’ from North(1975) might dig up buried narratives of victimization, sacrifice and atonement, their lyric tone gives a sense of an individual poet responding, now, to what he sees. Narrative, however, is characterized by its foregrounding of a series of events or actions which are connected in time. What happens at the end of ‘The Dead’ is determined by what happened earlier. The events are recounted more or less chronologically in Joyce’s story, in that the order of the telling follows the order of the told: first we learn of Gabriel and Gretta’s arrival, then56 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory of the party, and finally of what happens back at the hotel. But narratives also invariably involve what the narratologist Gérard Genette has called anachronisms – flashbacks, jumps forwards (or prolepses), the slowing down and speeding up of events and other distortions of the linear time-sequence (Genette 1986). Texts such as Virginia Woolf’s ‘The Mark on the Wall’ (1921) dislodge our sense of temporal sequence. The story begins: ‘Perhaps it was the middle of January in the present year’ (Woolf 1982, 41). This suggests that the events recounted span a number of months, but by the end we have the sense that the story follows the wanderings of the narrator’s consciousness over only a number of minutes or, at most, hours. Despite this and many other distortions of chronological order, however, Woolf’s text is only readable insofar as it exploits our expectations of narrative sequence. Indeed, these distortions themselves can only be conceived against a background of linear chronological sequence. Time, then, is crucial to narrative. But as the novelist E.M. Forster recog- nizes in Aspects of the Novel(1927), the temporal ordering of events is not the whole story. Forster makes a memorable distinction between ‘The king died and then the queen died’ on the one hand, and ‘The king died, and then the queen died of grief’ on the other (Forster 1976, 87). While the first ‘narrative’ includes two events related in time, he proposes, the second includes another ‘connection’, the crucial element of causality. The first simply lists two events, while the second provides the thread of a narrative by showing how they are related. The logical or causal connections between one event and another constitute fundamental aspects of every narrative. An obvious example would be detective stories. Detective stories rely, above all, on our expectation and desire for connection. They produce quite complex routes to a revelation of whodunnit, routes both determined and detected by the logic of cause and effect. The beginning–middle–end sequence of a narrative also tends to empha- size what is known as a teleological progression – the end(in Greek, telos) itself as the place to get to.

			- often think of a good story as one that we just cannot put down, a novel we compulsively read to find out what happens at the end. The narrative theorist Peter Brooks has studied ways in which readers’ desires are directed towards the end, ways in which narratives are structured towards, or as a series of digressions from, an ending: we are able to read present moments – in literature and, by extension, in life – as endowed with narrative meaning only because we read them inNarrative 57 anticipation of the structuring power of those endings that will retrospect- ively give them the order and significance of plot. (Brooks 1984, 94) Likewise, Brooks has elaborated the paradoxical ways in which the dénoue- ment or tying up of a story is worked towards through the paradox of digres- sion. Thus, for example, while we may find a novel, film or play frustrating if it contains too many digressions from the main plot, we enjoy the suspense involved in delaying a denouement. ‘Suspense’ movies, thrillers and so on, in particular, exploit this strangely masochistic pleasure that we take in delay. One of the paradoxical attractions of a good story, in fact, is often understood to be its balancing of digression, on the one hand, with progression towards an end, on the other. But what is this end which we so much desire? (We may find out in more detail below, in Chapter 34.) Brooks and others have suggested that narratives move from a state of equilibrium or stasis through a disturbance of this stabil- ity, and back to a state of equilibrium at the end. The end of a narrative, the state of equilibrium, occurs when the criminal is discovered, when the lovers get married, or when the tragic hero dies. In addition, this end is characteris- tically the place of revelation and understanding. A part of the equilibrium that endings apparently offer is the satisfaction of epistemophilia, the reader’s desire to know (from the Greek episteme, knowledge, and philia, love). And because of the conventional emphasis on hermeneutic discovery at the end, endings tend to be particularly over-determined places: we look to the end to provide answers to questions that the text has raised. In modernist narratives such as Woolf’s ‘The Mark on the Wall’, however, these answers tend to be withheld or else treated ironically. The ending of Woolf’s story is paradoxical, in fact, in that it resolves the question with which the story starts out – what is the mark on the wall? – by telling us that it is a snail. But this ‘answer’ to the question simply parodies those conventional realist endings that seem to clear up our confusions and satisfy our curiosity. So what if it is a snail? To say that the mark is a snail is an example of what is called an aporia – an impassable moment or point in narrative, a hermeneutic abyss. If we ask what Woolf’s story is ‘about’, we realize that it is about itself as a story. The ending tells everything, it gives us ‘the answer’, and it tells us nothing: it is not for this ‘answer’ that we have read the story. Our epistemophilia proves to be perverted. One of the most fundamental distinctions in narrative theory is that between ‘story’ and ‘discourse’. As Jonathan Culler has suggested, a funda- mental premiss of narratology is that narrative has a double structure: the level of the told (story) and the level of telling (discourse) (Culler 1981). These levels have been given different names by different theorists – the
		- 7.4

			- Russian58 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory formalists call them fabula and sjuzhet; the French structuralists call them either récit(or histoire) and discours, and so on. ‘Story’, in this sense, involves the events or actions which the narrator would like us to believe occurred, the events (explicitly or implicitly) represented. ‘Discourse’, on the other hand, involves the way in which these events are recounted, how they get told, the organization of the telling. In fact, of course, these two levels can never be entirely separated, and much narrative theory has been concerned to describe ways in which they interact. Thus Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyreand Joyce’s ‘The Dead’, for example, present the events of the narrative more or less in the order that they are alleged to have occurred. By contrast, texts such as Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heightsand Woolf’s ‘The Mark on the Wall’ move for- ward and backward in time and shift from the level of telling to that of the told in complex and unnerving ways. Many modernist and postmodernist texts experiment with the relation between these two levels, to denaturalize or defamiliarize our sense of how narratives function. A text such as Robert Coover’s short story ‘The Babysitter’ from Pricksongs and Descants(1969), for instance, presents several slightly different accounts of what appears to be the same evening from a number of different perspectives: the contradictions and dislocations produced within and between these accounts, however, make it impossible, finally, to determine the precise nature or order of the evening’s events. Alain Robbe-Grillet’s novels, such as The Voyeur(1955) and Jealousy(1957), also recount the ‘same’ series of events over and over again, but from the ‘same’ narratorial perspective: each telling, however, is subtly different, thus dissolving our sense of any one, true, narrative of events. Rather than reading such texts simply as exceptions or aberrations, we might consider ways in which they metafictionally reflect on the multiplicity of any narrative – its susceptibility to different readings, its differing narrative perspectives, its shifting senses of place and time. Everything that we have said about narrative up to this point has concerned the sense of its linearity: narrative involves a linear series of actions connected in time and through causality. In addition to this linearity, we might consider another important aspect of narrative, namely the relation between teller and listener or reader. Indeed, rather than appealing to the idea of a sequence of events, Barbara Herrnstein Smith has argued that we need to ground our understanding of narrative in terms of ‘someone telling someone else that something happened’ (Smith 1981, 228). The significance of this proposition is that it redirects our focus from the events or actions themselves to the rela- tionship between the author or teller and the reader or listener. As Jonathan Culler has put it, ‘To tell a story is to claim a certain authority, which listeners grant’ (Culler 1997, 89). Much of the work in narrative theory has involvedNarrative 59 attempts to discriminate among different kinds of narrators (first person or third person, objective or subjective, reliable or unreliable, so-called ‘omni- scient’ or not, together with questions concerning his or her ‘point of view’, his or her ‘voice’ and so on). Our understanding of a text is pervaded by our sense of the character, trustworthiness and objectivity of the figure who is narrating. Moreover, it is often very important to discriminate between the narratorial point of view and that of the so-called implied author – a particu- larly important distinction in certain ironic texts, for example. Although Jonathan Swift’s essay ‘A Modest Proposal’ (1729) would not usually be
		- 7.5
			- considered as a narrative, it does provide one of the classic examples of nar- ratorial irony. In this essay, the narrator proposes that in order to deal with poverty and hunger in Ireland and to prevent children of the poor from being a burden to their parents, such children should be sold to the rich as food – a solution that would be ‘innocent, cheap, easy, and effectual’ (509). The narra- tor appears to make his proposal seriously but we necessarily conceive of an ‘implied author’ who has very different views and motives, and who is making a political point about the immorality of the English government in its attitude towards poverty in Ireland. Our understanding of the ironic force of the text necessitates a discrimination between the two voices or personae of the narrator and the implied author. A consideration of the relationship between teller and listener or reader leads in turn to questions of power and property. One of the most famous storytellers is Scheherazade from AThousand and One Nights(a collection of tales that originated in the Middle East in the ninth–tenth centuries). In these classical Arabic narratives, Scheherazade has been sentenced to death by the king but is able to stave off her execution by telling him stories. By ending her story each night at a particularly exciting point, she is able to delay her death for another day because the king wants to find out what happens next. What makes A Thousand and One Nights so intriguing for narrative theorists has to do with its enactment of forms of power. As Ross Chambers proposes, ‘To tell a story is to exercise power’ (Chambers 1984, 50). Chambers argues that storytelling is often used, as in the case of Scheherazade, as an ‘oppositional’ practice, a practice of resistance used by the weak against the strong: ‘opposi- tional narrative’, he claims, ‘in exploiting the narrative situation, discovers a power, not to change the essential structure of narrative situations, but to change its other (the “narratee” if one will), through the achievement and maintenance of authority, in ways that are potentially radical’ (Chambers 1991, 11). In this respect, we might consider the motives and effects of Gretta’s story of her dead lover in ‘The Dead’: perhaps the ending of Joyce’s narrative should be understood in terms of the diffusion of Gabriel’s egoistic,60 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory domineering and even rapacious desire for his wife by Gretta’s narration of her love story. Gretta, subject to patriarchal society’s insistence on the husband’s rights to the wife’s body, displaces her husband’s unwanted attention by telling him a story. The violence of Gabriel’s desire is expressed in references to his longing ‘to be master of her strange mood...to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against him, to overmaster her’ (248). By the middle of Gretta’s narration, Gabriel sees himself, by contrast with the lover of her story, as a ‘ludicrous figure...idealizing his own clownish lusts’ and a ‘pitiable fatuous fellow’ (251). And by the end, all lusts and all passions and anger, all mastery and desire, have dissolved: ‘Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window’ (253). This conflict of stories – Gabriel’s about himself and Gretta’s about her dead lover – results in a dis- turbance of power relations. In this sense, just as much as ‘The Mark on the Wall’, or the stories of Coover and Robbe-Grillet, ‘The Dead’ is self-reflexively about the power of stories.
		- 7.6
			- More often, of course, it is the dominant ideology which is able to tell stories about, for example, how it got to be the dominant ideology. In the Soviet Union, it was the Bolsheviks and later the Stalinists who got to write the history books. In present-day China, the 1989 Tiananmen Square ‘massacre’ (as it is called in the West) is not in the history books at all and literary works that attempt to represent it, such as Ma Jian’s Beijing Coma(2008), are officially banned. At the same time, Chairman Mao still figures in textbooks as a largely benevolent and wise figure (despite what are acknowledged in China as his ‘excesses’ and what are generally regarded in the West as his ‘atrocities’), since his ‘thought’ continues to be the basis for current doctrine and policy of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (see http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/66095/4471924.html). The power exerted by Scheherazade and by Gretta is a specifically narrativepower. The only way that these storytellers can avoid death on the one hand and violent passion on the other is by making their stories good, by making them compelling to the point of distraction. By contrast, as far as the Soviet Union was concerned, for example, the Stalinist version of history did not even have to be plausible, because its lessons would be enforced in other ways. Narrativepower, then, may be the only strategy left for the weak and dispossessed: without narrative power, they may not be heard. The social and political importance of stories is eloquently expressed by the old man in Chinua Achebe’s novel Anthills of the Savannah(1987): ‘The sounding of the battle-drum is important; the fierce waging of the war itself is important; and the telling of the story afterwards – each is important in its own way’ (123–4). But, the man continues, the story is ‘chief among his fellows’:Narrative 61 ‘The story is our escort; without it we are blind. Does the blind man own his escort? No, neither do we the story; rather it is the story that owns us and directs us. It is the thing that makes us different from cattle; it is the mark on the face that sets one people apart from their neighbours.’ (124) Stories own us, and tell us, Achebe suggests, as much as we own or tell stories. There are many questions of narrative, then, which may be considered in relation to literature: temporality, linearity and causality, so-called omni- science, point of view, desire and power. But most of all, perhaps, it is the relation between narrative and ‘non-’ or ‘anti-narrative’ elements that fascinate and disturb. Aspects such as description, digression, suspense, aporia and self-reflection, temporal and causal disorders are often what are most com- pelling in narrative. A text such as Woolf’s ‘The Mark on the Wall’, indeed, has no narrative outside of description and aporetic reflections on the nature of narrative. Correspondingly, Joyce’s ‘The Dead’ depends to a large extent on moments of what Joyce refers to elsewhere as ‘epiphany’, moments ofrevel- ation or understanding, moments that appear to stand outside time, outside of narrative. As Gabriel watches his wife listening to a piece of music as they prepare to leave the party, there is just such a moment – a moment of revelation which is also a moment of mystery. Gretta, standing listening to a song is, for Gabriel, full of ‘grace and mystery...as if she were a symbol of something’ (240). Like Scheherazade’s, Joyce’s storytelling holds off, and hangs on, death. And as the snow falls on the world outside the hotel window at the end of the story,
		- 7.7
			- as Gabriel falls into unconsciousness and the narrative slips away, there is another moment of epiphany, a dissolution of time, of space, of life, of identity, desire and narrative.

	- ### 8 Character
	  collapsed:: true
		- 8. Character Characters are the life of literature: they are the objects of our curiosity and fascination, affection and dislike, admiration and condemnation. Indeed, so intense is our relationship with literary characters that they often cease to be simply ‘objects’. Through the power of identification, through sympathy and antipathy, they can become part of how we conceive ourselves, a part of who we are. More than two thousand years ago, writing about drama in the Poetics, Aristotle argued that character is ‘secondary’ to what he calls the ‘first essential’ or ‘lifeblood’ of tragedy – the plot – and that characters are included ‘for the sake of the action’ (Aristotle 1965, 40). Considerably more recently in an essay on the modern novel, ‘The Art of Fiction’ (1884), the novelist Henry James asked, ‘What is character but the determination of incident? What is incident but the illustration of character?’ (James 1986, 174). While Aristotle makes character ‘secondary’ to plot, James suggests that the two are equal and mutually defining. Indeed, the novels and plays we respond to most strongly almost invariably have forceful characters as well as an intriguing plot. Our memory of a particular novel or play often depends as much on our sense of a particular character as on the ingenuities of the plot. Characters in books have even become part of our everyday language. Oedipus, for example, has given his name to a condition fundamental to psy- choanalytic theory, whereby little boys want to kill their fathers and sleep with their mothers. Mrs Malaprop in Sheridan’s play The Rivals(1775) has given us the word ‘malapropism’ when someone uses, for example, the word ‘illiter- ate’ to mean ‘obliterate’ (see I.2.178). A ‘romeo’ denotes a certain kind of amorous young man resembling the hero of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet (c.1595). When we refer to someone as a ‘scrooge’, we mean a miser, but when we do so we are alluding, knowingly or not, to the protagonist of Charles64 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory Dickens’s AChristmas Carol(1843), for whom Christmas is a fatuous waste of time and money. Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita(1958) has given us a term for what the OEDdefines as ‘a sexually precocious schoolgirl’, as well as a word which especially through the Internet has acquired an association with the sexual abuse of children. There is even a day named after a fictional character, ‘Bloomsday’ (16 June), after Leopold Bloom in James Joyce’s Ulysses(1922). But what is a person or a character in a literary work? What does it mean to talk about a character as ‘vivid’ or ‘life like’? How do writers construct char- acters and produce the illusion of living beings? What is the relationship between a person in a literary text and a person outside it? As we shall try to demonstrate, these are questions that books themselves – in particular plays, novels and short stories – consistently explore. In this chapter, we shall focus, in particular, on the nineteenth-century realist tradition. It is, we suggest, this tradition which has culminated in the kinds of assumptions that we often hold about people and characters today. And it is against such preconceptions that modernist and postmodernist texts tend to work. Charles Dickens’s novels are indisputably from the nineteenth century. Whether or not they can be described as ‘realist’, though, is very definitely a matter of dispute. But this very uncertainty makes the novels particularly intriguing for a discussion of character since they tend both to exploit and to explode ‘realist’ conventions of characterization. Great Expectations (1860–1) opens with the orphan-hero, Pip, examining the writing on his
		- parents’ gravestones in order to attempt to determine the ‘character’ of his mother and father: As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like, were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, ‘Also Georgiana Wife of the Above’, I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. (35) The comedy of this passage is partly produced by the double sense of ‘character’ – as the shape of an inscribed letter on a tombstone and as the personality of a human being. The text implies that our knowledge of people is determined by writing, by the character of written words. Although he is ‘unreasonable’, in taking the shape of letters to denote character, Pip is not simply mistaken in recognizing that our sense of our self and of other people is developed through language. For as this passage clearly indicates, we construct ourselves through and in words, in the image-making, story-generating power of language. In this respect, it is significant that the opening to GreatCharacter 65 Expectationsexplores one of the major themes of literary texts: the question ‘Who am I?’ One fascination of characters in fiction and drama, as well as one of their most ‘characteristic’ activities, is to suggest answers to this question, not only for themselves, but also for us. To talk about a novel such as Great Expectationsas ‘realist’ is in part to sug- gest that its characters are ‘lifelike’, that they are like ‘real’ people. But what does this mean? The first requirement for such a character is to have a plaus- ible name and to say and do things that seem convincingly like the kinds of things people say and do in so-called ‘real life’. The second requirement is a certain complexity. Without this complexity, a character appears merely ‘one-dimensional’, cardboard or (in E.M. Forster’s terms) ‘flat’ (Forster 1976, 73). To be lifelike, a fictional character should have a number of different traits – traits or qualities which may be conflicting or contradictory: he or she should be, to some extent, unpredictable, his or her words and actions should appear to originate in multiple impulses. Thirdly, however, these tensions, contradictions, multiplicities should cohere in a single identity. Thus ‘lifelikeness’ appears to involve both multiplicity and unity at the same time. In the classic nineteenth-century realist novel Middlemarch (1871– 2), for example, there is a character called Lydgate of whom George Eliot observes: ‘He had two selves within him’, but these selves must ‘learn to accommodate each other’ in a ‘persistent self’ (182). It is this tension, between complexity and unity, that makes a character like Lydgate both interesting and credible. The importance of such unity in realist texts is made clear by works like Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde(1886) or, less melodramatically, Joseph Conrad’s ‘The Secret Sharer’ (1910): these narratives can be called ‘limit texts’ in that they use the frame- work of life like or realistic characters to explore what happens when the self is demonically split or doubled. In doing so, such texts challenge the basis of realism itself. Realist characterization presupposes a ‘mimetic’ model of literary texts whereby what is primary or original is a real person, and a character in a book is simply
		- a copy of such a person. Such a model does not allow for a reversal of this relationship: it does not allow for the possibility that, for example, a person in ‘real life’ might be convincing to the extent that he or she resembles a person in a book. On the face of it, such a reversal may sound rather strange or counter-intuitive: we would normally want to give priority to a ‘person’ and say that characters in books are more or less like ‘real’ people. In fact, however, as the example of Great Expectationssuggests, it is easy to demonstrate that things also work the other way round. Indeed, literary history contains vari- ous dramatic instances where ‘life’ copies fiction. After the publication of Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther in Germany in 1774, for example,66 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory there was a fashion among young men in Europe for suicide, an act modelled on the suicide of the eponymous hero of that novel. Similarly, J.D. Salinger’s novel The Catcher in the Rye(1951) was held responsible for the antisocial behaviour of numerous young men in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s who identified with the disaffected hero Holden Caulfield. The young, in fact, are often considered (by the old) to be in danger of mimetic dissipation, to endanger themselves, their families and society because they identify with and then copy the actions and attitudes of disreputable people in books or, more recently, in films, on TV, in videos or computer games. This paradox of character whereby people in books are like ‘real’ people who are, in turn, like people in books, is suggested by the words ‘person’ and ‘character’ themselves. We have been using these words more or less inter- changeably, though with an implicit and conventional emphasis on the ‘reality’ of a person and the ‘fictionality’ of a character. But the words are worth examining in more detail. According to Chambers Dictionary, ‘person’ signifies both ‘a living soul or self-conscious being’ and ‘a character repres- ented, as on the stage’. Indeed, ‘person’ goes back to the Latin word persona, the mask worn by an actor in a play on the classical stage. The English language uses the word ‘persona’ to signify a kind of mask or disguise, a pretended or assumed character. The word ‘person’, then, is bound up with questions of fictionality, disguise, representation and mask. To know a person, or to know who a person is, involves understanding a mask. In this respect, the notion of person is inseparable from the literary. This is not to say that ‘real’ people are actually fictional. Rather it is to suggest that there is a complex, destabilizing and perhaps finally undecidable interweaving of the ‘real’ and the ‘fictional’: our lives, our reallives, are governed and directed by the stories we read, write and tell ourselves. There is a similar enigma about the word ‘character’: just as the word ‘per- son’ has a double and paradoxical signification, so ‘character’ means both a letter or sign, a mark of writing, and the ‘essential’ qualities of a ‘person’. Again, the etymology of the word is suggestive: from the Greek word kharat- tein, to engrave, the word becomes a mark or sign, a person’s title and hence a distinguishing mark – that which distinguishes one person from another – and from this a ‘fictional’ person or a person on stage. Pip’s characterological read- ing ofhis parents’ tombstones, then, is perhaps not so far off the mark. And in Hamlet, when Polonius tells his son Laertes that he should
		- remember his ‘precepts’ or advice, he plays on this double sense, using ‘character’ as a verb: ‘And these few precepts in thy memory / Look thou character’ (I.iii.58–9). In this way, Shakespeare’s play suggests how intimately ‘character’ is bound up with inscription, with signs, with writing.Character 67 We have argued that the realist novel tends to rely on a particular con- ception of what a person is – that a person is a complex but unified whole. We might develop this further by suggesting that the realist model of character involves a fundamental dualism of inside (mind, soul or self) and outside (body, face and other external features). The ‘inside’ that we associate with being human has many different forms. In the nineteenth century this was often described in terms of‘spiritual life’ or ‘soul’. More recently, it has just as often (and perhaps more helpfully) been understood in terms of the uncon- scious. The following extracts from the first paragraph of George Eliot’s novel Middlemarchwill allow us to explore this in more detail: Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bear- ing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible, – or from one of our elder poets, – in a paragraph from today’s newspaper. She was usually spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her sister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress differed from her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its arrangements; for Miss Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed conditions, in most of which her sister shared. The pride of being ladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably ‘good’ [...] Young women of such birth, living in a quiet country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a parlour, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s daughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made show in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was required for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from reli- gious feeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have deter- mined it [...] and to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity, made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in guimp and artificial protru- sions of drapery. [...] (29–30) This extraordinary opening paragraph, with its ironic insistence on the importance of clothes despite Dorothea Brooke’s spiritual aspirations, clearly acknowledges that physical appearance (outside) works as a sign of character68 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory (inside). What is indicated here is an opposition that is fundamental in realist texts: that there is an inside and an outside to a person, that these are separate, but that one may be understood to have a crucial influence on the other. The opening to Middlemarchconcentrates almost obsessively on Dorothea’s clothes because it is her clothes that allow us
		- insight into her character. As this suggests, another convention of characterological realism is that character is hidden or obscure, that in order to know another person – let alone ourselves – we must decipher the outer appearance. Eliot constantly manipulates and plays with the mechanisms of such realism, above all with that form of tele- pathy or mind-reading whereby a narrator can describe a character from the outside but can also know (and keep secrets about) that character’s inner thoughts and feelings, conscious or unconscious. At the same time, by evok- ing Dorothea’s appearance in terms of how ‘the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters’ and by comparing her ‘plain garments’ to ‘the impressiveness of a fine quotation’, Eliot subtly foregrounds a sense of the painterly and the textual. We are drawn and caught up in intriguing uncertainties about where representation (a picture or text) begins or ends. From Dorothea’s clothes, then, Eliot weaves a fine and intricate web of character – in terms of the familial, social and political, and in terms of the moral and religious. Indeed, one of the most striking sentences of the excerpt focuses ironically on this concern with clothes: ‘She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in guimp and artificial protrusions of drapery.’ The passage as a whole makes it clear, however, that Dorothea’s puritan plainness is simply the reverse side of a ‘keen interest in guimp’. Her preference for ‘plain dressing’ is itself a complex and considered statement of fashion. It is at this point, in particular, that Eliot’s ironic presentation of Dorothea involves a subtle questioning of the conventional opposition between a ‘spiritual life’ on the one hand and the ‘artificial protrusions of drapery’ on the other. The passage suggests that this opposition is itself artificial, that whatever people ‘really’ are cannot be separated from how they appear. It suggests that people are constituted by an interplay of inner and outer, but that it is not a question of one being the truth and the other mere surface. So while realist conventions of character may rely on the opposition between inner and outer, mind or spirit and body, and so on, Eliot’s description of Dorothea also shows how this opposition can be questioned from within the realist tradition itself. This brings us to one of the central questions raised by many novels: How can we know a person? As we have seen, realist novels such as George Eliot’s attempt to answer this question by presenting people as knowable by a number of ‘outward’ signs of ‘inner’ worth. Appearances, however, can beCharacter 69 deceptive. Indeed, many novels and plays are concerned with the problem of deception or disguise, with discriminating between an appearance that is a true sign of inner value and one that is not. The realist tradition often relies on the possibility of such deception, while also presupposing the possibility of finally discovering the worth or value of a person by reading the outward signs. The exposure, despite appearances, of Bulstrode’s hypocrisy, for example, and the final validation of Lydgate’s good character are central to the plot of Middlemarch. But the fact that a ‘person’ is itself, in some sense, a ‘mask’, means that even if we think we ‘know’ the soul or self of a person, his or her true identity, there is always a possibility, even if that person is ourself, that such an identity is itself a form of mask. This irreducible uncertainty may partly account for realism’s obsessive concern with the question: ‘Who am I?’ The stories
		- of Raymond Carver (1938–88), like many so-called post- modern texts, relentlessly play with such conventions of characterological construction and perception. In ‘Cathedral’ (1983), for example, the some- what obtuse, belligerent, intolerant, discriminatory narrator finds it both comic and unnerving to think about how a blind man, a friend of his wife who has come to visit, looks – even while (or because) he cannot look. The narrator is struck by the fact that the blind man does not wear dark glasses. This disturbs him, since although at first sight the blind man’s eyes ‘looked like anyone else’s eyes’, on closer inspection (and the narrator takes the oppor- tunity for a lengthy session of unreciprocable inspection) they seem ‘creepy’: ‘As I stared at his face, I saw the left pupil turn in toward his nose while the other made an effort to keep in one place. But it was only an effort, for that eye was on the roam without his knowing it or wanting it to be’ (297). The story culminates in a dope-smoking session in which the blind man teaches the narrator the advantages of drawing with closed eyes, of the necessary visual imagination of the blind. On one level, the story performs a conventional reversal of the blind and the seeing, figuring the blind man as the seer. But on another level, Carver explores conventions of characterological construction by querying the equation of the look of someone with their identity (the eyes, conventionally the most telling indicator of character are, for our view of the blind man, just ‘creepy’ signifiers of mechanical dysfunction, disconnected from intention, emotion, will), and by prompting an awareness that in this story it is the one who is notseen – either by us as readers or by the blind man – who most fully exposes himself, exposes his ‘character’, in all its belliger- ence, intolerance and obtuseness. As we have seen, it is difficult in an absolute sense to separate real from fictional characters. To read about a character is to imagine and create a char- acter in reading: it is to create a person. And as we have tried to show, reading70 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory characters involves learning to acknowledge that a person can never finally be singular – that there is always multiplicity, ambiguity, otherness and uncon- sciousness. Our final point concerns what it means to ‘identify’ with charac- ters in fiction. It seems difficult, if not impossible, to enjoy a novel or play without, at some level, identifying with the characters in it. In fact, the most obvious definition of the ‘hero’ or ‘heroine’ of a novel or play would be the person with whom we ‘identify’, with whom we sympathize or empathize, or whose position or role we imaginatively inhabit. The anti-hero, by contrast, is the character with whom we might identify, but only in wilful resistance to prevailing codes of morality and behaviour. ‘Identification’ in any case is never as simple as we might think. To identify with a person in a novel or play is to identify oneself, to produce an identity for oneself. It is to give oneself a world of fictional people, to start to let one’s identity merge with that of a fiction. It is, finally, also to create a character for oneself, to create oneself as a character. Further reading A good place to start in thinking more about literary character is Uri Margolis’s lucid cognitive-psychological essay ‘Character’ (2007). For an alternative and reasonably accessible account, see Harold Bloom, ‘The Analysis of Character’ (1990). A classic if somewhat reductive
		- account of character may be found in Chapters 3 and 4 of Forster’s Aspects of theNovel(1976), first published in 1927. For a good discussion of character in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century novel, see Martin Price, Formsof Life(1983). A very different and more challenging approach is Thomas Docherty’s Reading (Absent) Character(1983), which focuses in particular on the nouveau roman and postmodern writing generally, in order to move beyond a ‘mimetic’ theory of character to one in which characterization is seen as ‘a process of reading and writing’. For an excellent, if difficult, argument for the deconstruction of character which challenges the humanist perspective of a unified self and argues for ‘an esthetic and ethic of the fragmented self’, see Leo Bersani’s important book A Future for Astyanax: Character and Desire in Literature (1978); see also Hélène Cixous’s ‘The Character of “Character” ’ (1974). J. Hillis Miller’s chapter on ‘Character’ in Ariadne’s Thread(1992) brilliantly weaves literary with critical, theoretical and philosophical reflections on character. On the question of identification in psychoanalysis and literature, see Diana Fuss, Identification Papers(1995).
	- ### 9 Voice
	  collapsed:: true
		- 9. Voice Nothing is stranger, or more familiar, than the idea of a voice. In George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda (1876), a character called Mrs Meyrick ob- serves that ‘A mother hears something like a lisp in her children’s talk to the very last’ (423). In Shakespeare’s King Lear(1605), the blinded Gloucester recognizes Lear from his voice: ‘The trick of that voice I do well remember; / Is’t not the King?’ (IV, vi, 106–7). In both of these examples we have what appear to be confirmations of the persistence of identity, expressed in the singular or peculiar nature (the ‘trick’) of a person’s voice. But in each of these exchanges we are also presented with a kind of strangeness as well: in the con- text of Eliot’s novel, for example, we may reflect on the irony of the fact that what the mother recognizes in her children, what it is in their voice that confirms the persistence of their identity, is something that cannot be heard, a lisp perceived only by the mother. Moreover, there is something strange in the idea that an adult’s speech should be, in a dream like or hallucinatory fash- ion, haunted by the past in this way. In the example from Shakespeare, on the other hand, it is difficult for us not to be aware of the terrible precariousness of recognition and, by implication, of identity: Gloucester may believe that he recognizes, and may indeed recognize, the trick of the king’s voice, but we are all too aware of the fact that he can never again seethe king, never confirm the king’s identity by sight. And ironically, Gloucester is only reunited with Lear thanks to help from his son Edgar, whose voice (disguised as Tom o’ Bedlam) Gloucester failsto recognize. The examples from Eliot and Shakespeare appear, at least initially, to be about the familiarity and individuality of voice. But like literary texts more generally, they are also concerned with the ways in which a voice may be strange and disturbing. We may enjoy a novel like Raymond Chandler’s72 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory The Little Sister(1949) partly on account of the distinctive, gritty, cinemato- graphic voice-over of Marlowe the narrator, but one of the things that makes this novel haunting and powerful, as well as comical, is its sensitivity to the strangeness of voices. Thus, for example, we have Miss Mavis Weld, apparently concerned about her brother: ‘She clutched her bag to her bosom with tight little fingers. “You mean something has happened to him?” Her voice faded off into a sort of sad whisper, like a mortician asking for a down payment’ (39). Or we have Marlowe recounting a phone call: ‘The phone rang before I had quite started to worry about Mr Lester B. Clausen. I reached for it absently. The voice I heard was an abrupt voice, but thick and clogged, as if it was being strained through a curtain or somebody’s long white beard’ (41). The power of a voice is made dramatically clear by the British govern- ment’s censorship of the Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams: for a number of years (until September 1994) his voice was, in effect, illegal. His words, when broadcast, had to be spoken by an actor. Few voices could be said to have haunted the British media at that time as forcefully as Gerry Adams’s. But a concern with what is powerful, haunting and strange about voices is hardly a recent phenomenon. One need only think of the importance of oracles, and the intimate links between voice and prophecy in the Bible and
		- other clas- sical texts. Consider, for instance, the voice that announces in I Corinthians 13: ‘Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. / And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing’ (1–2). Or think of the apocalyptic voices at the end of the Bible, in the Book of Revelation – for example of the angel who comes down from heaven, whose ‘face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire’ and who cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. (Rev. 10: 3–4) In both of these biblical quotations voice is described in terms that identify it with the non-human – with musical instruments (sounding brass or tinkling cymbal), with the sound of a lion or with the sound of thunder. It is also pre- sented in terms of multiplicity (speaking in tongues, the voices of the sevenVoice 73 thunders) and of uncanniness (the voice that has the gift of prophecy and is apparently omniscient; the voice that is forbidden, that must be sealed up). All of these characteristics are important for thinking about literary texts more generally. Literature, in fact, might be defined as being the space in which, more than anywhere else, the power, beauty and strangeness of the voice is both evoked or bodied forth anddescribed, talked about, analysed. In this respect, reading literary texts involves attending to extraordinary voices. One of the most obvious extremes of voice in literature is in relation to music – in other words, the idea that voice becomes pure sound, turns into music. Here we may recall Walter Pater’s proposition that ‘all art constantly aspires towards the condition of music’ (Pater, 111): this is as much true of the ‘smoky kind of voice’ (202) whose singing transfixes and transforms the life of the narrator in Jean Rhys’s story ‘Let Them Call It Jazz’ (1962) as it is of the glozing, serpentine voice that seduces Eve in Milton’s Paradise Lost(Book IX, 532ff.), or of the song of the skylark or of the nightingale to which Shelley and Keats respectively aspire in their great song-like odes. At the same time, how- ever, we are all perfectly aware that literary texts are not(simply) music or song. Part of what makes texts literary is indeed their peculiar, paradoxical relation to music (not least in lyric poems and ballads, originally performed with or as music). That is to say, poems or short stories or other texts may aspire towards the condition of music, but they are necessarily stuck in their so-called linguistic predicament. Thus Coleridge’s ‘Kubla Khan’ (1798) is concerned with the demonic power of music played by ‘A damsel with a dulcimer’ and with the paradoxical desire to ‘build’ the very things that the poem has described (a pleasure-dome and caves of ice) ‘with music’: A damsel with a dulcimer In a vision once I saw: It was an Abyssinian maid, And on her dulcimer she played, Singing of Mount Abora. Could I revive within me Her symphony and song, To such a deep delight ’twould win
		- me, That with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice! In Shelley’s ode ‘To a Sky-Lark’ (1820), on the other hand, the speaker ends by implying that he is unteachable:74 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory Teach me half the gladness That thy brain must know, Such harmonious madness From my lips would flow The world should listen then –as I am listening now. Shelley’s ode thus aspires to the ‘harmonious madness’ it can never voice. Similarly, Keats’s ode of 1819 can acknowledge the ‘ecstasy’ of the night- ingale’s ‘voice’, but the speaker also recognizes that he can never triumph in the desire to ‘dissolve’ his identity with that voice. Being stuck, in this respect, is no doubt a fundamental condition of literature. Not surprisingly then, literary texts call to be thought about not only in terms of how they body forth voices but also in terms of how they reflect, comment on and analyse what ‘voice’ means. As Eve’s temptation by the snaky sibilants of Satan suggests, in Milton’s Paradise Lost, a voice can be astonishingly seductive. Interest- ingly, a voice can become even moreseductive by referring to the fact that it is being seductive. (The contemporary commercial success of phone-sex may also testify to this.) Voice seduces: as the etymology of seduction may suggest (se-, aside, ducere, to lead), it leads us aside or draws us away. What does it mean to talk about voice in relation to literary texts? Take the opening of a short story by Raymond Carver, entitled ‘Fat’ (1963). It begins: I am sitting over coffee and cigarettes at my friend Rita’s and I am telling her about it. Here is what I tell her. It is late of a slow Wednesday when Herb seats the fat man at my station. This fat man is the fattest person I have ever seen, though he is neat- appearing and well dressed enough. Everything about him is big. But it is the fingers I remember best. When I stop at the table near his to see to the old couple, I first notice the fingers. They look three times the size of a normal person’s fingers – long, thick, creamy fingers. (64) This is, in some ways at least, a descriptively straightforward opening. But once we reflect on it, we find that it is doing many different and quite sophist- icated things. The first point to observe is that this is a first person narration with a strong sense of a speaking voice: we are drawn away by what we might call the ‘reality effect’ of a speaking voice that is produced in part through the conversational language – the lexical items and syntax, the topic, use of the present tense, repetition – and in part through the explicit reference to the fact that the narrator is speaking and ‘telling’ us something. The opening sentences, in a quite subtle way, put the reader in the position of the narrator’s friend RitaVoice 75 (‘I am telling her...Here is what I tell...’). Despite the seductively ‘realistic’ or ‘everyday’ quality of voice here, something fairly complex is going on: we are presented with a narrator who, even in the apparently straightforward lan- guage of the opening two sentences, makes it clear that this is a self-referential or metafictional story, a story that is at least at some level a story aboutstory- telling. The seductiveness of an apparently casual speaking voice tends to distract attention from this dimension of the text. Moreover, without really drawing attention to the
		- fact, we have up till now been referring to the ‘I’ of the story as the narrator. In other words, we have been making an implicit distinc- tion between narrator and author. This is a first-person narration and the nar- rator, we quickly learn, is a waitress. What we are being presented with, in other words, is the ‘voice’ of a girl or young woman. At the same time, how- ever, there is a sort of double-voicing here to the extent that we may recognize this text as being characteristic of Raymond Carver’s work. In this respect, we could say, there is also the phantasmatic voice of Carver lurking in these lines. We hear the ‘voice’ of Carver in a figurative, ghostly sense (like a signature tune). Rather differently, there is Thomas Hardy’s poem, ‘The Voice’: Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me, Saying that now you are not as you were When you had changed from the one who was all to me, But as at first, when our day was fair. Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then, Standing as when I drew near to the town Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then, Even to the original air-blue gown! Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness Travelling across the wet mead to me here, You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness, Heard no more again far or near? Thus I; faltering forward, Leaves around me failing, Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward, And the woman calling. Written in December 1912, ‘The Voice’ belongs to the series of so-called ‘1912–13 poems’ that Hardy wrote following his first wife’s death. (Emma76 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory Hardy died in the preceding month, November 1912.) It is difficult, in other words, not to read this poem as autobiographical – to understand it as a poem about the poet’s experience of mourning following his wife’s death. But the poem is more than simply autobiographical: it is about the radical uncertainty of human identity and experience, their faltering. ‘The Voice’ not only describes the uncanny experience of hearing a dead person’s voice but in some sense transfers the call to us in turn. The poem functions as a kind of strange textual switchboard. Again, we can respond to the poem in quite straightforward terms – it is a poem about someone who is out walking in an autumn or early winter landscape and who thinks he hears the voice of a woman whom he once loved (who was ‘all’ to him) but who is no longer above ground (‘heard no more again far or near’). As its title suggests then, it is about ‘the voice’ he hears. But it is also a poem about voice more generally, and about the relationship between poetry and hearing a woman’s call. (This may in turn recall the notion of inspiration in classical Greek and Roman times, in other words, hearing the voice, music or song of a female Muse or Muses.) This is evident, for example, in the opening line: ‘Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me’. What we are presented with here is an affirmation of the spooky actuality of hearing a dead woman’s voice – an affirmation which the poem proceeds to question (‘Can it be you that I hear?’), but which it concludes by reaffirming (‘Thus I; faltering forward...And the woman calling’). This opening line, however, is at the same time grammatically ambiguous: ‘how’ suggests a questioning as
		- well as an exclamation. ‘Call to me, call to me’, on the other hand, can be read as an echo (as twovoices, even if the second is a double of the first) or as changing from an exclamation – ‘how you call to me’ – to a demand or appeal: ‘call to me’. The ending of the poem suggests either that the speaker is off his head, hearing voices, or that the dead really do come back and it is indeed possible to hear voices from beyond the grave. But it also suggests something about literary texts in general. Every one of the writers who has been discussed in this chapter is dead. But as we indicate in our discussion of the ‘death of the author’ (in Chapter 3), every literary text can be thought of as involving a voice from beyond the grave, since every text is at least potentially capable of outliv- ing the person who originally gives voice to it. The woman in Hardy’s poem is in this respect a figure of the poet par excellence. Do we hear Hardy’s voice in ‘The Voice’ or not? Or – to reflect on the poem in a quite different way altogether, that is to say in the light of what Harold Bloom calls ‘the anxiety of influence’ – do we perhaps hear Keats’s voice in this poem? Bloom’s cele- brated theory (Bloom 1973) is that what impels poets to write is not so much the desire to reflect on the world as the desire to respond to and to challengeVoice 77 the voices of the dead. For Bloom, any ‘strong’ poem will always involve an encounter between the ‘living’ poet – in this case Hardy – and the dead – in this case perhaps most obviously Keats, whose ‘Ode to a Nightingale’ is also explicitly concerned with the ‘dissolving’ qualities of voice and identity. From a Bloomian perspective, Hardy’s reference to ‘You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness’ might be read not so much as an address to the poet’s dead wife (strange enough as that gesture may itself seem) but rather as an eerie and ambivalent ‘revisitation’ ofKeats’s lines: That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, And with thee fade away into the forest dim: Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget What thou amongst the leaves hast never known... Keats’s voice might, in this sense, be said to haunt ‘The Voice’ as much as it does other Hardy poems, such as ‘The Darkling Thrush’ (1900) – the very title of which explicitly refers us to Keats’s ode (‘Darkling I listen...’). In poems such as ‘The Voice’ and ‘The Darkling Thrush’, in other words, we can recognize the ‘trick’ of Hardy’s voice in terms of an idiomatic tone (lugubrious, plaintive, ironic etc.) and idiomatic rhymes and neologisms (‘listlessness’, ‘wistlessness’). But this is ‘voice’ in a figurative, ghostly sense. Moreover, it is ‘voice’ as plural – haunted by, for example, the voice or voices of other poets such as Keats. The examples of Carver and Hardy are helpful because they highlight a number of important ideas for thinking about voice in relation to literature. First they suggest that the question of voice is never simple, even (or perhaps especially) when it appears to be. Second, and more specifically, they suggest that literary texts not only presentvoices but also have things to say aboutwhat voices are and how we might or might not hear them. Third, there is invariably more than one voice in a literary text, even if it is a matter of a voice ostensibly just
		- talking or responding to itself. This final point can be thought about further in at least two ways. On the one hand – and this has been an important feature of recent literary theoretical concerns – there is the importance of seeing literature as a space in which one encounters multiple voices. Literary texts call upon us to think about them in terms of many voices – for instance, in terms of what M.M. Bakhtin calls heteroglossiaor of what he, Julia Kristeva, Roland Barthes and others refer to as polyphony. Literature is, as Salman Rushdie has observed, ‘the one place in any society where, within the secrecy of our own heads, we can hear voices talking about everything in every possible way’ (Rushdie 1990, 16). Saleem,78 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory the narrator of Rushdie’s novel Midnight’s Children (1981), is an excellent example: he is telepathic, like every so-called omniscient narrator in a work of fiction, and he is continually hearing multiple voices. As he remarks: ‘I was a radio receiver, and could turn the volume down or up; I could select individual voices; I could even, by an effort of will, switch off my newly- discovered inner ear’ (164). On the other hand – and this has been a related and similarly important feature of recent critical and theoretical concerns – literature encourages us to think about the idea that there may in fact be no such thing as avoice, a single, unified voice (whether that of an author, a narrator, a reader or anyone else). Rather, there is difference and multiplicity withinevery voice. There is, then, not only the kind of socio-literary polyphony that Bakhtin describes, and which he illustrates for example by looking at the way Dickens orchestrates, inhabits and detaches himself from the role of various speakers in his novel Little Dorrit(Bakhtin 1992, 203–5). But in addition to this, and more funda- mentally, any one voice is in fact made up of multiple voices. There is differ- ence and polyphony within every voice. We have tried to suggest this by looking at some of the ways in which the voice of an author or poet is always a sort of ghostly site for a gathering of voices. We might conclude, then, with a thought proffered in one of the ‘Adagia’ (or ‘aphorisms’) of the poet Wallace Stevens: ‘When the mind is like a hall in which thought is like a voice speaking, the voice is always that of someone else’ (168). Further reading For two traditional but in some respects still stimulating accounts of voice and literature, see Yvor Winters, ‘The Audible Reading of Poetry’ (1957), and Francis Berry, Poetry and the Physical Voice(1962). A more recent and theoretically informed account is provided by Furniss and Bath (1996), in their chapter on ‘Hearing Voices in Poetic Texts’. Roland Barthes has very engaging, thought-provoking things to say about voice, for example in S/Z (Barthes 1990b). On heteroglossia, see M.M. Bakhtin, The Dialogic Imagination(1981). For Kristeva and polyphony, see for example the essay ‘Word, Dialogue and Novel’ (Kristeva 1986). For a challenging but compelling account of the strangeness of the narrator’s ‘I’ in a literary text, see Maurice Blanchot’s ‘The Narrative Voice’ (Blanchot 1981). On voice in relation to print and reading, see Griffiths, The Printed Voice of Victorian Poetry(1989). On poetry, voice and hearing, see Geoffrey Hartman’s eclectic and stimulating essay, ‘Words and Wounds’ (Hartman 1981), and, for a more technical, difficult but fascinating study, see Garrett Stewart’s Reading Voices (1990).Voice 79 Steven Connor’s remarkable study Dumbstruck – A Cultural History of Ventriloquism(2000) offers a
		- wide-ranging account of voice especially in rela- tion to spiritualism and teletechnology. The philosopher David Appelbaum’s Voice(1990) is a brilliant and idiosyncratic study of such dimensions of ‘voice’ as the cough, laugh, breath and babble. Oliver Sacks’s Seeing Voices(1991) is a thought-provoking exploration specifically in the context of deafness, while Wesling and Slawek’s Literary Voice(1995) draws on philosophy, linguistics and other disciplines to defend literary voice against ‘modern philosophy’s critique of the spoken’. Finally, from a specifically psychoanalytic perspective, see Mladen Dolar’s essay ‘The Object Voice’ (1996).

	- ### 10 Figures and Tropes
	  collapsed:: true
		- 10. Figures and tropes It’s not for nothing that some still call Elvis Presley ‘The King’ and Eric Clapton ‘God’. But the force of these acts of renaming depends on the assumption that no one takes them literally. We take it that no one ever sup- posed that the United States had become a monarchy and put Elvis Presley on the throne. No one, not even the most loyal of fans, even in his heyday, believed that Eric Clapton created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. They may have believed that his guitar-playing was transplendent, but even those whose judgement was blurred by an unholy mixture of illegal substances and Clapton’s heavenly guitar solos are unlikely to have taken him for the Almighty Himself. These renamings of Presley and Clapton, then, involve the kind of exaggeration or verbal extravagance known as hyperbole. By the same token, few are likely to take as gospel the theologically unorthodox if slightly more credible statement in Pink’s 2004 hit single, that ‘God is a DJ’ (‘If God is a DJ / Life is a dance floor / Love is the rhythm / You are the music’). To refer to Elvis as ‘The King’ or Clapton as ‘God’, or to talk in turn about God as a DJ, is to use figurative language. Literary language is sometimes thought about in terms of its deviations from or distortions of ordinary language. Like many generalizations, this idea is both useful and misleading. It suggests that literary texts are characterized by the use of figures of speech or tropes, conceiving these as basically synony- mous – in other words, as deviations from ‘ordinary’ or ‘literal’ language. Thus Chambers Dictionary defines a rhetorical figure as ‘a deviation from the ordinary mode of expression’, and trope as ‘a figure of speech, properly one in which a word or expression is used in other than its literal sense’. Such figures include, for example, hyperbole, metaphor, metonymy and anthropomor- phism. Metaphor is the general term for the figure of resemblance, wherebyFigures and tropes 81 one thing is likened to another. Metonymy is a general term for the figure of association or contiguity, whereby one thing is talked about by referring to something associated with it. Anthropomorphism is the general term used to refer to the non-human as if it were human. So-called ‘ordinary’ language, by contrast, is thought to use far more literal language, language that calls a spade a spade. As the examples of Presley, Clapton and Pink suggest, however, the figura- tive is by no means restricted to literary texts: rather, it saturates all language. Friedrich Nietzsche famously argued that even truth itself is figurative. In his essay ‘On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense’ (1873), Nietzsche asks ‘What, then, is truth?’ and offers the following answer: A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms – in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins. (Nietzsche 1980, 46–7) When we think that we speak ‘truthfully’, without the distortions of figuration, Nietzsche suggests, we only deceive ourselves. The language of truth, lan- guage supposedly purified of figures and tropes, is simply language to which we have become so habituated that we no longer recognize it as
		- figurative. This suggests that our world is constituted figuratively, that we relate to our- selves, to other people, to the world, through figures of speech. The mani- pulation and exploitation of figurative language may therefore be understood to have fundamental implications for the political, social, even economic constitution of our world. The very way that we understand the world may be said to be mediated by the kinds of figures that we use to speak about it. We could think about this in terms of any everyday aspect (aspect is a visual metaphor) of life – for example, the names of newspapers, those ‘organs’ (a metaphor) that help to organize(the same organic metaphor) our world: the Herald, Guardian, Sun, Mirror, Telegraph, Tribuneand so on. While such discourses as history, philosophy, psychology, economics and so on may, at least in principle, attempt to rid themselves of figurative language, it is pre- cisely figuration which is, unavoidably, at the heart of the discipline of literary studies. This unavoidability is suggested in the passage from Nietzsche, with its concluding figuration of metaphors as coins. Nietzsche explicitly relies on the figurative to demystify language and thus to formulate a definition of the truth. As Paul de Man remarks, tropes are not ‘a derived, marginal, or aberrant82 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory form of language but the linguistic paradigm par excellence’: figurative language ‘characterizes language as such’ (de Man 1979, 105). Central to literary criticism and theory, then, are such questions as: What are the effects of rhetorical figures in literary texts? What purpose do they serve? And how do they function? One of the most common misconceptions about literary texts is that their figurative language is simply decorative, some- thing added to the text to make it more readable, more dramatic, or more ‘colourful’. It is certainly true that the perceived presence of figurative lan- guage often seems to increase at points of emotional and dramatic intensity, like the soaring violins at moments of sexual passion or dramatic tension in a Hollywood film. Thus D.H. Lawrence, for example, is known for his so-called ‘purple passages’. But simply to suggest that figures are ‘added’ to literary language, like the musical soundtrack to a movie, does not get us very far. The soaring violin theory of rhetorical figures is misguided because, as Nietzsche suggests, language is inescapably figurative: the meaning of a text cannot be separated from its expression, its figures. Figuration is fundamental to our world, to our lives. An alteration in the way we figure the world also involves an alteration in the way that the world works. Take Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man(1952), for example. This novel uses invisibility as a figure (both metaphorical and literal) for the marginality, the oppression, effacement and dehumanization of black people in the United States. Here is the opening to the prologue to Ellison’s great novel: I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids – and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors and hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination – indeed, everything and anything except me. (3) Visibility and invisibility figure the social, political and economic effacement and consequent
		- oppression of blacks in the United States. The man is invisi- ble because he cannot escape the preconceptions that others have concerning him. These preconceptions are produced by a ‘perception’ of his skin colour. This so-called perception is itself an effect of the kind of rhetorical figure we call synecdoche, whereby a part – here, the skin – stands for the whole – a man. But simply to categorize someone as ‘black’ (or ‘white’) is in a sense laughably reductive and inaccurate. Likewise, to say that someone is ‘coloured’ is in aFigures and tropes 83 sense to say nothing at all, because the skin, hair, nails, eyes, teeth of each one of us is a multichromatic assemblage of different hues. The categories of black, white and coloured operate as instances of synecdoche. What people ‘see’ is a form of metaphor, a figment or figure of imagination – a ‘phantom in other people’s minds...a figure in a nightmare which the sleeper tries with all his strength to destroy’ (3). It is in this way that Ellison’s narrator is invisible, for while people think that they see – they think they see a black man – in fact they see nothing, they are blinded by metaphor. Ellison’s novel suggests that such habitual blindness may be challenged and in turn transformed by acts of language. It presents a metaphor or allegory of the invisible man to counter the worn coin of representation. After all, the effacement of the black man is, in a crucial sense, constituted through acts of language. Without the vocabulary of prejudice and racism, any such effacement would be inconceivable. Racism is an effect of language. In particular, the passage from Ellison cited above suggests that racism is an effect of synecdochic substitution – skin pigment for personal identity, individual for collective or racial identity. The invisible man can be seen again, his invisibility perceived, through alternative metaphors, through rhetorical figures. The opening of Ellison’s novel, then, gives us one answer to the question of how figures and tropes function in literary and other texts: they can make us see what is otherwise invisible, concealed by prejudice, effaced by habit. They seek to change the world. To recall the term used by Viktor Shklovsky and other Russian formalist critics writing in the 1920s, figurative language has the capacity to ‘defamiliarize’ our world – to refigure, reform, revolutionize. What kinds of effects can be produced through figuration and how far can a reading of such figures go? Let us consider another example, a poem by the nineteenth-century New England poet Emily Dickinson. In Dickinson’s work, figures, like language considered more generally, tremble on the edge of meaning. One reason why her poetry is particularly appropriate in a dis- cussion of figurative language is that it characteristically ‘deconstructs’ or defamiliarizes its own rhetorical figures: her poetry constitutes a subtle yet decisive assault on figuration itself. This poem (no. 328) was written around 1862: A Bird came down the Walk— He did not know I saw— He bit an Angleworm in halves And ate the fellow, raw, 5 And then he drank a Dew From a convenient Grass—84 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory And then hopped sidewise to the Wall To let a Beetle pass— He glanced with rapid eyes 10 That hurried all around— They looked like frightened Beads, I thought— He stirred his Velvet Head Like one in danger, Cautious, I offered him a Crumb 15 And he unrolled his feathers And rowed him softer home— Than Oars divide the Ocean, Too silver for a seam— Or Butterflies, off
		- Banks of Noon 20 Leap, plashless as they swim. In language at once direct and elusive, the poem describes a bird eating a worm, taking a drink and flying away. The rhetorical figure which stands out in the opening lines is personification or anthropomorphism. Both the bird (‘he’) and the worm (the ‘fellow’) of the first stanza are described as if they were human. But the anthropomorphic insistence of the first half of the poem becomes strangely convoluted as it goes on to explore the specificity of simile (a is like b) as a species of metaphor (a is b, in other words the ‘like’ is unstated). In line 11 we learn that the bird’s eyes ‘looked like frightened Beads’. But this simile is not as simple as it looks. It remains unclear whether ‘looked like’ means that the eyes actively looked(they looked, in the way that beads look, assuming that they do), or whether the bird’s eyes, to the narrator, looked like beads. The simile is itself ambiguous. Moreover, whatthe eyes looked like – the beads – also undergoes an uncanny metamorphosis. To refer to beads as ‘frightened’ is to employ the rhetorical figure called animism, whereby an inanimate object is given the attributes of life. Far from clarifying the look of the bird’s eyes, the simile makes it lessconcrete, less visible or imaginable, by making a comparison with something that cannot possibly be seen. It is entirely incorrect to say that the bird’s eyes ‘looked like’ frightened beads, since frightenedbeads are not available to the gaze at all, and beads cannot look. The simile, a peculiar example of a ‘transferred epithet’, disturbs the sense of who or what is frightened and confounds the distinction between the figurative and the literal, image and word, the imagined and the visible.Figures and tropes 85 The last two stanzas of the poem increase these uncertainties. In the penul- timate stanza, rowing on an ocean is the ‘vehicle’ for the metaphor, the ‘tenor’ or ‘meaning’ of which is flying. But once again the figure is ambiguous: the ocean metaphor is inadequate, the line suggests, to express the softness, the silvery delicacy of the movement of the bird’s flight. Where a boat would leave a wake in the water, a kind of seam, the bird leaves none in the air. But while ‘Too silver for a seam’ may be ‘translated’ as meaning something like ‘too delic- ate for a wake or track in water’, the line may also be understood to be referring to the delicacy of figurative language and its relation to the world. Critics usually distinguish simile within metaphor more generally by pointing out that phrases such as ‘like’ or ‘as’ mark simile as explicitly figurative. Through another kind of figure known as paronomasia – produced by the homophone ‘seam’/‘seem’ – the poem reflects silently on figuration itself. Metaphors seem to be unmarked, too silver, too subtle, for a seam, or for the word ‘seem’ (or ‘as’ or ‘like’), too delicate for the mark of figuration. Just as there is no seam left behind after the bird’s flight – it flies as if by magic – metaphor also leaves no mark, no ‘seem’ and no seam. Or, to put it more paradoxically but more accurately, like the word ‘plashless’, a word which negates ‘plash’ but does so only by referring to it, metaphor both does and does not leave a mark. The extraordinary ending to the poem involves another metaphor for the bird’s flight – the flight of a butterfly – but presents this in terms of swimming. The bird is like
		- a butterfly leaping off a bank into the water so delicately that there is no (s)plash. With the phrase ‘Banks of Noon’, however, Dickinson’s poem disturbs the basis of metaphorical transformation itself. ‘Banks of Noon’ is no more comprehensible than the ‘frightened Beads’ encountered earlier. The metaphorical transitions are short-circuited, for while it is pos- sible to see that a bird’s flight is ‘like’ rowing a boat, it is unclear how a bank of noon can be ‘like’ anything physical – are we to believe that ‘noon’ can be a kind of riverbank, for example? The phrase highlights the deceptiveness of figuration, its potential for linguistic effects of trompe l’æiland hallucination. It dramatizes the ease, the inevitability with which language slides away from referential assumptions. On the other hand, ‘Banks of Noon’ can be con- sidered in terms of another kind of phenomenon – intertextuality – whereby a text is woven out of words and phrases from elsewhere. In this respect, the phrase recalls the Shakespearean ‘bank and shoal of time’ from Macbeth’s mur- derous speech (MacbethI.vii.6) – giving the sense of the present as a kind of isthmus within the ocean of eternity – and suggests the end or the edge of time, time strangely suspended or delayed. The ending of Dickinson’s poem suggests that figurative language entails a series of displacements and substitutions which both produce and withhold the illusion of reference. In these and other86 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory ways, Dickinson’s poem suggests that figures make and unmake our world, give us meaning and take it away. In our discussion of Dickinson’s poem, we have drawn attention to the self- reflexive possibilities of figuration, to the way that figures can turn reflexively back on themselves, trope themselves, so that the text remarks on its own lan- guage. To end our discussion of figures, we shall turn briefly to another text which may also be shown to register the uncanny potential of figurative lan- guage. In our chapter on narrative we referred briefly to James Joyce’s great long short story ‘The Dead’. The story begins with the following sentence: ‘Lily, the caretaker’s daughter, was literally run off her feet’ (199). In fact, Lily is not literallyrun off her feet at all. Strangely, we say ‘literally run off her feet’ to mean notliterally but figuratively run off her feet. The use of the word ‘literal’ here, like the phrase about feet, is metaphorical. In this respect, we can see that the opening sentence to the story produces a play of figuration which refers indirectly both to the subject of the story, death, and to its telling. ‘Literally run offher feet’ is a dead metaphor, a metaphor which has become so common that its identity as figurative has largely been lost: dead metaphors are Nietzsche’s worn coins of language. We can say ‘I was literally run off my feet’ without recognizing that we are using a metaphor at all, that far from using the phrase literally, we are exploiting a figure of speech. The metaphorical use of the word ‘literally’ in this phrase is a good example of the evocative possibilities of ‘cat- achresis’, the rhetorical term for a misuse or abuse of language. ‘The Dead’, which is above all about death, is also about dead language, dead metaphors. Joyce’s story ends with the return of a ‘figure from the dead’ (251), the haunting memory of Gretta’s dead boyfriend, Michael Furey. In the final pages, Gretta’s husband Gabriel looks out of the window of a hotel as his wife sleeps. The last paragraph of the story is
		- couched in intense, swooning, highly figurative prose: A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little grate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead. (255–6)Figures and tropes 87 The most remarkable, the most pressing feature of this paragraph is, perhaps, repetition. In particular, the word ‘falling’ occurs seven times: falling obli- quely, falling, falling softly, softly falling, falling, falling faintly, faintly falling. This verbal repetition produces a mesmeric sense of descent, sleep, fading and death. What Joyce appears to be evoking here, through figurative effects of language – repetition, alliteration, assonance and sibilance, syntactic inver- sion or chiasmus (‘falling faintly, faintly falling’) – is a fading out, a falling off, of language itself. ‘The Dead’ is about the death of (figurative and literal) language. To borrow Joyce’s metaphor and reverse it, it is indeed the metaphorical death of language (rather than the death of metaphorical language) that gives the story life. And it is, more generally, the productive tensions of figurative language that give life to literary texts. In this chapter, we have tried to suggest that, like literature itself, literary criticism begins and ends with figuration. In reading we should try to figure out ways in which figures at once generate and disturb literary texts. Like Marvell’s lover in his desire to stop the sun (see Chapter 4), if we cannot escape figures, still we can make them run. Further reading Two good recent ‘introductions’ to the idea of metaphor from the perspective of literature and literary theory in the one case and linguistics and stylistics in the other, are David Punter, Metaphor (2008) and Murray Knowles and Rosamund Moon, Introducing Metaphor(2006). For an engaging and inform- ative further guide to figures and tropes, see Arthur Quinn’s little book Figures of Speech(1993). See Paul Ricoeur’s The Rule of Metaphor(1978) for a difficult but comprehensive work on metaphor from the perspective of a philosopher. For a classic literary critical approach, see Brooke-Rose’s A Grammar of Metaphor(1958). An influential structuralist account of figura- tion or ‘poetic’ language is Roman Jakobson’s ‘Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics’ (1960). Derrida’s ‘White Mythology’ (1982) is a dense and difficult but by now classic argument against the notion that there could be any simple escape from figurative language.

	- ### 11 Creative Writing
	  collapsed:: true
		- 11. Creative writing Is this it then? Is this creative writing? What is ‘creative writing’ anyway, and what is a chapter on creative writing doing in a book on literature, criticism and theory? What is it that writing creates? And what is the differ- ence between ‘creative writing’ and ‘literature’? In what follows we would like to explore two general propositions: (1) ‘cre- ative writing’ doesn’t appear from nowhere. It has a history and is closely bound up with both the contemporary university and the current state of English (both as a language and as a subject of study). In particular, the recent surge in the popularity of ‘creative writing’ courses is intricately entwined with the history of the term ‘literature’ and with recent developments in literary criticism and theory. (2) Despite appearances perhaps, ‘creative writing’ often serves to delimit the liberating and exhilarating, but also fearful possibilities of language. In this, it shares something with the dictionary, which offers the following definition of ‘creative’: Specifically of literature and art, thus also of a writer or artist: inventive, imaginative; exhibiting imagination as well as intellect, and thus differ- entiated from the merely critical, ‘academic’, journalistic, professional, mechanical, etc., in literary or artistic production. So creative writing, such writing. (OED, sense 1b) Let us note first of all that the OEDhas no hesitation in identifying ‘creative writing’ with ‘literature’ and ‘art’. The OEDdefinition is predicated on the basis of a firm distinction between ‘imagination’ and ‘intellect’. Thus ‘creative’ is differentiated from other sorts of writing (‘the merely critical, “academic”, journalistic, professional, mechanical, etc.’). But how seriously can we take this distinction? Is there nothing ‘creative’ about other sorts of writing?Creative writing 89 Definitions, as we know, are never ‘merely academic’: they are forms and conduits of power. We might note one further intriguing detail in this dic- tionary definition, namely the scare quotes around ‘academic’. ‘Creative writing’, this might suggest, is both ‘academic’ and non-academic. As the deceptive simplicity of the OEDdefinition is perhaps beginning to make clear, ‘creative writing’ has a strange relation to the academy and to the academic. In fact, creative writing appears to have been institutionalized, in more than one sense of that word, since the incorporation of ‘creative writing courses’ within educational institutions is inevitably a form of appropriation and control. As early as 1958 we find the Oxford Magazine(4 December, no. 164/2, cited in OED) declaring that ‘In America established, or at any rate committed, writ- ers have been absorbed, permanently or temporarily, into the apparatus of cre- ative writing workshops.’ This ‘apparatus’, establishing itself across British universities and elsewhere, has become increasingly powerful. Few practising writers (novelists and poets in particular) today can become commercially successful without becoming a part of this apparatus, however temporarily or unwillingly. But there is also a more radical way of construing this apparatus or ‘creative writing machine’, namely as the means by which the dangerous and disruptive possibilities of language, and of ‘writing’ in particular, are (apparently) contained, reduced, locked up. What does it mean that the unpredictable powers of creativity, of creative writing, are being incorporated into and assessed by the university? What is going on in the desire or apparent need to turn creative writing into an ‘apparatus’, a useful tool or machine? To begin to respond to such questions, we have first of all to reckon with the ways that the emergence of ‘creative writing’ is linked to the history of the concept of literature. As the OEDdefinition makes clear, ‘creative writing’ is inseparable from the question of literature. It has been fashionable in recent
		- years, especially in the field of cultural studies, to regard literature as one sort of discourse or cultural product among others, such as philosophical dis- course, or a film, or a restaurant menu. But in this context, Bennett and Royle, we like to think, is nothing if not unfashionable. Our concern is with the idea that there is in fact something distinctive about literature and that, in short, literature is not commensurable with other sorts of discourse. One reason for this is quite simple: literature in a sense does not exist. It has no essence. It is not a case of X being a literary text, and Y being non-literary. Literariness is more spectral and elusive. Any text conventionally considered as literary (Geoffrey Chaucer’s ‘The Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale’, say) can be read as non-literary (for example, as an account of female sexuality in the Middle Ages); and conversely, any text conventionally considered as non-literary (a political speech, say) can be read as literary (for example, in terms of an90 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory enactment of the strange ways of language, the workings of metaphor and other rhetorical figures). As Jacques Derrida has put it: ‘There is no literature without a suspendedrelation to meaning and reference’ (Derrida 1992a, 48). It is not that literature does not refer – for instance, we have to construe ‘wife’ and ‘Bath’ in relation to a world of ‘meaning and reference’, we have to make some sort of sense of these two words. But literature has to do with a certain suspendednessof such referring, as well as a dependenceon what is referred to. To take another example: how should we read the phrase ‘midnight’s chil- dren’, in the title of Salman Rushdie’s 1981 novel? We are impelled by a desire to go beyond suspense, for example in order to be able to state categorically and definitively that the words ‘midnight’s children’ refer to the moment on the 14/15 August 1947 when India became independent and to the children who happened to be born just at that time. But the peculiar literariness of the title-phrase consists, at the same time, in the fact that it is enigmatic, resistant to any final stable determination. One could not, after all, even hope to exhaust the readings of the title without an exhaustive reading of the text to which that title refers. Strangely suggesting that children are of or belonging to a time (‘midnight’ with its connotations of the witching hour, darkness and mystery, the peculiarly decisive yet uncertain, spooky border between day and night), that there could be children of time but perhaps not space and that a book could itself somehow bethese children, Rushdie’s title conjures the bizarre telepathic mass of fictional narrative opened up in its name. Midnight’s Children, after all, is not – or not only – social or political history: it is a novel, a work of literature or (notice how odd this might sound) creative writing. As we argue elsewhere in this book (see the chapter entitled ‘Mutant’), ‘literature’ is a comparatively modern invention. The emergence of creative writing in the mid-twentieth century in the USA, and more recent institutional expansions in the UK and elsewhere, are part and parcel of the process whereby the question ‘What is literature?’ or ‘What is literariness?’ becomes a central topic in literary texts themselves, as well as in literary criticism and the- ory. It is in this context that we might situate the proliferation, in the twentieth century, of poems about poetry and novels about novels. We might recall here Wallace
		- Stevens’s declaration in his great long poem The Man with the Blue Guitar(1938): ‘Poetry is the subject of the poem, / From this the poem issues and / To this returns’ (Stevens 176); or Samuel Beckett’s characterization of the work of James Joyce: ‘His writing is not about something; it is that something itself ’ (Beckett 1983, 27). Significantly also, in this context, the last decades of the twentieth century witnessed the appearance of the term ‘metafiction’, to designate ‘fiction about fiction’, ‘self-conscious’ or ‘self- reflexive fiction’ (a term dating from 1960, according to the OED). And theCreative writing 91 word ‘postmodern’ is of course bound up with this increasingly explicit attention to the nature of the literary, to the literariness of the literary. But we should not oversimplify this. No doubt literary works have, to greater or lesser extents, always drawn attention to themselves, foregrounding their own strange nature: think of Shakespeare’s plays within plays, in Hamlet or A Midsummer Night’s Dream, or Cervantes’s Don Quixote, or Sterne’s Tristram Shandy, or Diderot’s Jacques le fataliste, or Wordsworth’s The Prelude. Nevertheless it also seems clear that creative writing is itself a new and differ- ent kind of foregrounding. It is as if ‘Creative Writing’ were calling out: ‘Look at me, come and write literature here, come and experience the literary, it’ll be fun! This way to the creative writing class!’ This particular institutionalized flagging of literature could also be regarded as a flagging in the sense of ‘becoming exhausted’ – and here we might think of Gilles Deleuze’s marvel- lous essay on ‘the exhausted’ (in Deleuze 1998) as a way of understanding contemporary literature (especially in the wake of Samuel Beckett). In all sorts of ways, in fact, we might see literature (and therefore creative writing) as coming to an end, its very existence increasingly threatened for example by the ubiquities of visual, digital and text cultures (film, TV, video, DVD, texting, email, the Internet, gaming). It is not without reason that J. Hillis Miller opens his book On Literature (2002) with the words: ‘The end of literature is at hand. Literature’s time is almost up’ (Miller 2002, 1). But we do not necessarily want to link the rise of creative writing with the ‘end of literature’. (As Hillis Miller’s book goes on to make clear, things are in fact more complex than his initial apocalyptic pronouncement might suggest.) Instead, we would like to conclude by proposing six ways in which creative writing offers new challenges and insights in relation to thinking about liter- ature and literary studies. 1. ‘Creative writing’ is not simply opposed to ‘critical writing’. We might most readily understand this in terms of the notion of metalanguage. Metalanguage is language about language, a discourse that takes another discourse as its object. Literature might thus be viewed as the ‘object- discourse’ for which literary criticism or theory functions as a metalan- guage. But the logic of metalanguage is everywhere. It was already operating in our title phrase: ‘Creative writing’, this chapter, is not in any simple or conventional sense an example of creative writing. ‘Creative writing’ signifies rather that this is a chapter about creative writing. Wherever we encounter talking about talking, stories about stories, poems about poetry, statements (like this one) that refer to themselves, we are engaged in effects of metalanguage. But there is something odd about metalanguage,92 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory something that makes it a double-bind, that is to say at once necessary and impossible. A metalinguistic or metadiscursive text (for example, a work of literary criticism or theory) cannot
		- proceed to take another text (a work of literature or creative writing) as its object without that ‘object’ being at the same time, in this very gesture, part of the ‘meta-text’. Metalanguage is never pure, it always entails a logic of being apart from anddependent on in its object-language. The acknowledgement that you cannot write about another text without either doing something to it or its doing something to your ‘own’ writing (if only by virtue of your quoting it, and therefore quoting it out of context, in a new and different context) led Roland Barthes to his celebrated declaration: ‘Let the commentary be itself a text’ (Barthes 1981, 44). Is Barthes a creative writer? The difficulty of respond- ing to this question has to do, at least in part, with the ways in which his work unsettles, plays with and over the putative borders and distinctions between creative and critical writing. His texts (like those of Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Hélène Cixous) call for new forms, styles and inventions both in literary criticism or theory and in literature or creative writing. This is not to suggest, however, that creative and critical writing are really just the same thing. Such is the other side of the double- bind: metalanguage is necessary, as well as impossible. Critical writing does not involve ‘a suspended relation to meaning and reference’ in the way that literary or creative writing does. 2. One does not know, as one writes or as the writing comes, one cannot know if it is creative or not, if it will have been creative or not. Who will have been the judge of whether such and such a piece of writing is or is not ‘creative’? Isn’t ‘creative writing’ necessarily predicated on an experience of reading that is to come, like a promise? ‘I promise to be creative,’ you might say. But unlike other kinds of promises, it may not be in your own power to determine whether or not you will be ‘creative’. Following Cixous, we could say that the only ‘creative writing’ worthy of the name entails the experience of what is beyond us, beyond our capabilities, impossible. She declares: ‘The only book that is worth writing is the one we don’t have the courage or strength to write. The book that hurts us (we who are writing), that makes us tremble, redden, bleed’ (Cixous 1993, 32). 3. Creative writing, if there is any, entails what Timothy Clark (in his study of the idea of inspiration) calls ‘a crisis of subjectivity’ (Clark 1997). He suggests we might think about this in terms of the blank page facing the would-be writer. This ‘blank page’ has been conceived in various ways. The seventeenth-century poet Thomas Traherne, for example, described it metaphorically, in terms of infancy: ‘An empty book is like an infant’sCreative writing 93 soul, in which anything may be written. It is capable of all things, but containeth nothing’ (Traherne 1991, 187). Clark, on the other hand, describes the blank page as a ‘virtual space’ that is ‘neither in the psyche of the writer nor...outside it’: this ‘space of composition’, as he calls it, ‘skews distinctions of inner and outer’, of ‘self and other’ (Clark 1997, 22, 27). Writing, creative writing, is transformative, performative in ways that cannot be calculated or foreseen. The writer does not simply precede the writing. The figure of ‘the writer’ is in crucial respects always ‘phantas- matic’, never simply ‘empirical’ or given (see Clark 1997, 24–6). As Blanchot puts it: ‘Writing is nothing if it does not involve the writer in a movement
		- full of risks that will change him [or her] in one way or another’ (Blanchot 1995, 244). One of the things that makes creative writing, in the context of the university, so distinctive and potentially troublesome is that it entails an explicit engagement with these forms of the transform- ative and performative, the risky and incalculable. 4. If creative writing involves an openness to otherness, to what has tradition- ally been called ‘inspiration’ or ‘the muse’ or ‘God’, it nevertheless also involves something singular, apparently unique, like a signature. It is some- thing ‘akin to style’, as Raymond Carver remarks in his brief but powerful essay ‘On Writing’, ‘but it isn’t style alone. It is the writer’s particular and unmistakable signature on everything he [or she] writes. It is his [or her] world and no other...[The writer] has some special way of looking at things and...gives expression to that way of looking’ (Carver 1986, 22). It is thus possible to read a phrase or sentence or two by, say, William Blake (the Argument to ‘The Marriage of Heaven and Hell’) or Emily Dickinson (Poem 214) or Franz Kafka (Aphorism 43 in The Collected Aphorisms), and recognize in this the sort of style or signature to which Carver is referring: Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burdened air; Hungry clouds swag on the deep. I taste a liquor never brewed— From Tankards scooped in Pearl— As yet the hounds are still playing in the courtyard, but their prey will not escape, however fast it may already be charging through the forest. In each case it is a question of these lines, these phrases marking the distinctive ‘style’ of a writer. No one but Blake could talk about Rintrah roaring or hungry clouds swagging on the deep; no one but Dickinson94 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory could achieve quite this combination of the wondrous, the visceral and the abstract; no one but Kafka offers quite this sense of inescapable claus- trophobia and doom. We might here recall what Coleridge said of first encountering two lines from Wordsworth’s ‘Winander Boy’: ‘had I met these lines running wild in the deserts of Arabia, I should have instantly screamed out “Wordsworth!”’ (Coleridge 1956–71, 1: 453). In an extraordinary essay entitled ‘He Stuttered’, Gilles Deleuze de- scribes this sort of signature or singularity in terms of the invention of a new kind of language, a kind of foreign language within a language. He writes: a great writer is always like a foreigner in the language in which he expresses himself, even if this is his native tongue. At the limit, he draws his strength from a mute and unknown minority that belongs only to him. He is a foreigner in his own language: he does not mix another language with his own language, he carves out a nonpreexi- stent foreign language withinhis own language. He makes the language itself scream, stutter, stammer, or murmur. (Deleuze 1998, 109–10) This foreign language is never purely the writer’s own, of course: it is always made up of words from elsewhere and might always turn out to have been the wrong language. Such is the anguish and uncertainty evoked by Roland Barthes when he writes, of himself, as if he were a character in a novel: ‘Writing a certain text, he experiences a guilty emotion of jargon, as if he could not escape from a mad discourse no matter how individual he made his utterance: and what if all his life he had chosen the wrong language!’ (Barthes 1977c, 114–15). 5. Creative writing happens, if it
		- happens, in a strange nursery. This is another way in which, as a course or subject, ‘creative writing’ inhabits a quite disturbing and peculiar place within the university: the university is perhaps no longer to be understood as an adult venue, or even as a place in which you mature or ‘grow up’. As Sigmund Freud remarks in ‘Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming’ (1907): ‘every child at play behaves like a cre- ative writer’ (Freud 1985f, 131). The greater the creative artist, in Freud’s view, the more he (or she) remains childlike. As he declares in another essay, on Leonardo da Vinci: ‘all great [artists] are bound to retain some infantile part. Even as an adult [Leonardo] continued to play, and this was another reason why he often appeared uncanny and incomprehensible to his contemporaries’ (Freud 1985g, 220). 6. Creative writing, if there is any, is urgent despatch, with radically uncertain address. Paul Celan’s description of a poem as ‘a message in a bottle’ (Celan 1986, 34; quoted in Clark 1997, 272) is apt here. A work of creativeCreative writing 95 writing would be a sort of letter, perhaps a letter-bomb. Elizabeth Bowen says of her first experience of reading Rider Haggard’s strange novel She: ‘After She...I was prepared to handle any book like a bomb’ (Bowen 1986, 250). If you are thinking of writing a novel, it is ‘Not a bad plan to think [it’s] going to be a letter’ (Forster 1976, 162), suggests E.M. Forster – but a letter being read, we might add, after you’re dead. Creative writing: keep it compact, think of that iceberg Ernest Hemingway talked about (seven-eighths of the text should be invisible: see Hemingway 2000, 1694), hurry up, it’s a matter of life and death, write now. As the Jewish proverb has it: ‘Sleep faster! We need the pillows’ (quoted in Bloom 1994, 448).

	- ### 12 Laughter
	  collapsed:: true
		- 12. Laughter ‘We are very sorry, indeed, to learn what happened,’ said a BBC spokesman on hearing about the death of a Goodies fan while watching the show. ‘He just laughed heartily and too long,’ said his wife. ‘After 25 minutes of laughing he gave a tremendous belly laugh, slumped on the settee, and died. (He) loved the Goodies, and it was one of the best for a long time’... (Guardian, 26 March 1975) T he man’s death was, no doubt, a great misfortune. But, as the response of his wife might suggest, there was also something quite funny, and even appropriate about it. The word ‘funny’ here is oddly ambiguous: how funny it is, after all, that a word (‘funny’) should mean both ‘amusing’ and ‘strange’. The peculiar appropriateness of the death of this Goodies fan consists not only in the fact that it was a particularly good episode of the comedy pro- gramme (‘one of the best for a long time’), but also in the way in which it is sug- gestive of a more general and perhaps more intimate link between laughter and death. When we say that someone ‘died laughing’ or ‘laughed themselves to death’ we are, in most circumstances, speaking metaphorically. What is funny (in both senses) about the case of the Goodies fan is that it involves a literaliza- tion of this metaphor. To take a metaphor literally (which can also be called ‘catachresis’ or ‘misapplication of a word’) is an example of a rhetorical device that is often very effective as a means of generating laughter. In this respect it would seem that the man’s death conforms to the conventions of comedy. But, of course, there is also a darker side to this, the side that involves ‘funny’ in the sense of ‘funny peculiar’. In other words, what this newspaper report also prompts us to ask is: why do we talk about ‘dying with laughter’ or ‘laughing oneself to death’? Why do we talk about actors ‘corpsing’, in other words, ofLaughter 97 being unable to speak their lines because of a sudden fit of hysterical laughter? Are all these instances simplymetaphorical? Is there something about laugh- ter that, in a profound if ticklish way, puts it in touch with death? Let us leave these questions in suspense for a little while. What about laughter and literature? We often think of literature as very (or, dare one say, ‘deadly’) serious, especially if we are studying it. In part this is because (as we suggest in greater detail in Chapter 19) literature is linked to notions of the sacred, to a sense of hushed respect. But literature is also about pleasure, play and laughter. In this chapter we shall attempt to provide an account of some of the ways in which laughter has been theorized, down the centuries, and attempt to illustrate these theories in relation to par- ticular literary texts. Finally, we shall focus on the idea of literature as a space in which the notion of seriousness itself, and the distinctions between the ‘serious’ and ‘non-serious’, are fundamentally unsettled, thrown into ques- tion, discombobulated. There are few things worse than the prospect of trying to talk about laugh- ter, or trying to define what is humorous. It is something of a lost cause from the start. It automatically seems to put us – if we dare risk a slightly risible ana- logy at this point – in the position of the frog, in the joke about the frog, the chicken and the librarian. A chicken walks into the local town library, goes up
		- to the librarian’s desk and says: ‘Bok!’ So the librarian gives the chicken a book. The chicken goes away, but comes back the next day, goes up to the librarian’s desk and says: ‘Bok, bok!’ So the librarian gives the chicken two books, the chicken goes away, comes back the next day: ‘Bok, bok, bok!’ So the librarian provides the chicken with three more books. And the next day ‘Bok, bok, bok, bok!’ and so on until the fifth day, when the chicken comes in and says to the librarian, ‘Bok, bok, bok, bok, bok!’ The librarian hands over five books but then decides to follow the chicken, at a surreptitious distance, out of the library. The librarian follows as the chicken goes down the street, across the road and down a smaller street, then through an unbolted wooden door, down a passageway, into a garden, across the garden to a small lake, across a narrow bridge to an island in the middle, where the chicken puts the books down in front of a frog who says: ‘Reddit, reddit...’ If there is laughter here it would be the result of a number of things. First, there is the ridiculous anthropomorphism: chickens do not go to libraries, librarians do not respond to chickens as if they were simply ‘members of the public’, frogs do not read books. Second, there is the pleasure of recognition as we realize that the ‘bok, bok’ of a chicken could after all be heard as a request for a book, or for two books, and that the croaking of a frog might indeed be construed as ‘read it, read it’. Third, there is the sense of a so-called shaggy98 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory dog story, the feeling that the story could go on indefinitely, that the chicken could, at least in principle, order up the entire holdings of the British Library. Bok, bok, bok...Here laughter would be linked to suspense, and more specifically perhaps to the hysterical effect of a potentially permanent post- ponement of a resolution. It is this which in part at least constitutes the comic force of a play such as Beckett’s Waiting for Godot(1953). But by the same token it would also be what haunts or menaces every tragedy: comedy in this sense could be defined as the overturning of the tragic. But there is perhaps also, by contrast, something comical about the very corniness (so to speak) of the joke, its ‘cheepness’ and groan-making quality. In this respect the joke relies on a certain surprise – the surprise of the punchline – and a certain recognition: you know that a punchline is going to come and what sort of punchline it will be, but you cannot tell exactly what it will be. There is a child- like pleasure involved in laughing at something at once surprising and familiar. Perhaps indeed, as Freud argues in his fascinating book Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious(1905), ‘everything comic is based fundamentally on degradation [or “stepping down”] to being a child’ (Freud 1976, 292). Finally, this ridiculous story about the frog, the chicken and the librarian sug- gests something about the relations between laughter, reading and mystery. For perhaps what is also funny about the story is the implicit hyperbole whereby anyone (let alone a frog) could be expected to have read everything. In this respect we can never be in the position of the frog or – to put it more specifically in terms of our argument in this chapter – there is never a truly froglike position from which
		- to provide a serious account of laughter. Any theory of laughter, we would like to suggest, is necessarily infected, under- mined, displaced by the experience of laughter itself. Let us consider a couple of the basic theories of laughter. The first is the ‘superiority theory’. It is succinctly and memorably formulated by the seventeenth-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes: ‘The passion of laughter is nothing else but sudden gloryarising from some sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by comparisonwith the infirmityof others, or with our own formerly’ (Hobbes 1840, 46). We laugh, according to this argument, out of a sense of superiority – the ‘sudden glory’ or ‘conception of eminency’ in relation to the stupidity or weakness of others, or of ourselves at some point in the past. Thus, for example, we may laugh at the man who slips over on the banana skin, or we may laugh at Bottom, in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, because he is such an ass, or we may laugh with Swift at the small-mindedness of other human beings, for example in Book I of Gulliver’s Travels(1726).Laughter 99 The second theory is what we could call the ‘nothing theory’ or the ‘no theory’ theory. This may be illustrated by way of the Monty Python sketch in which a woman called Miss Anne Elk (John Cleese in drag) is interviewed because she is supposed to have a new theory about the brontosaurus. Miss Elk will not disclose her theory but seems instead concerned simply to say over and over again that she hasa theory and that the theory is hers: ‘my theory that I have, that is to say, which is mine, is mine’. Chris, the interviewer (Graham Chapman), becoming exasperated, says: ‘Yes, I know it’s yours, what is it?’ Looking rather nervously around the studio, Anne Elk replies: ‘Where?’ (Monty Python’s Flying Circus 1989, 119) When Miss Elk does finally enunciate her theory it is truly bathetic – in fact, no theory at all: Miss Elk Ready? Presenter Yes. Miss Elk My theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets. This theory goes as follows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I own it, and what it is too. Presenter That’s it, is it? Miss Elk Spot on, Chris. (119) In more sombre and philosophical terms, the ‘nothing theory’ or ‘no theory’ theory is suggested, for instance, by Immanuel Kant’s proposition that ‘Laughter is an affection arising from a strained expectation being suddenly reduced to nothing’ (Kant 1988, 199). Laughter is nothing more than the bursting of a bubble. When we laugh, according to this argument, we are laughing in a sort of ‘absurd’ vacuum: ‘merely’ laughing, with nothing to support us. In a fascinating essay entitled ‘The Laughter of Being’, Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen suggests a radicalization of this Kantian formulation. Following the work of the French writer Georges Bataille in particular, he argues that ‘There is no theory of laughter, only an experience’ (Borch- Jacobsen 1987, 742). Moreover, this experience is of a decidedly ‘funny’ sort – for it is an experience of, precisely, nothing. As Bataille puts it: ‘[when I laugh,] I am in fact nothing more than the laughter which takes hold of me’ (Bataille 1973, 364, cited by Borch-Jacobsen, 744). Let us turn from ‘theory’ to consider some literary examples. Laughter can be dependent on the visual – and literature is full of instances of visual comedy. But laughter, at least in literature,
		- is perhaps more fundamentally a matter of language. One of the greatest eighteenth-century English comedies is Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s play The School for Scandal (first performed in 1777).100 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory It contains numerous classic moments of visual comedy (characters in dis- guise, hiding themselves behind screens, being thrust hastily into closets and so on), but the comic power of Sheridan’s play consists above all in its lan- guage. This starts from the very title of the play – with its satirical implication that scandalmongering is something to be taught – and from the names of its characters – a woman called Lady Sneerwell, her servant, Snake, a gentle- man called Sir Benjamin Backbite, and so forth. We could consider a brief exchange between Lady Sneerwell and Mr Snake on the subject of her ‘superiority’ over other slanderers and scandalmongers such as Mrs Clackitt: Lady Sneerwell Why truly Mrs Clackitt has a very pretty talent – and a great deal of industry. Snake True, madam, and has been tolerably successful in her day. To my knowledge she has been the cause of six matches being broken off and three sons disinherited, of four forced elopements, and as many close confinements, nine separate maintenances, and two divorces. Nay, I have more than once traced her causing a tête-à-têtein the Town and Country Magazine, when the parties perhaps had never seen each other’s face before in the course of their lives. Lady Sneerwell She certainly has talents, but her manneris gross. Snake ’Tis very true. She generally designs well, has a free tongue, and a bold invention; but her colouring is too dark and her outlines often extravagant. She wants that delicacy of hint and mellowness of sneer which distinguishes your ladyship’s scandal. Lady Sneerwell You are partial, Snake. (I, i, 10–26) We can imagine the comic possibilities of the characters’ gestures and appearance, but what is most comic is in the language itself – in the satirical observation on what it means to be ‘tolerably successful’, in the incongruity or absurdity of evaluating who has the more beautiful ‘sneer’, in the snaking sibilance of Snake’s last sentence, in the playful truth of Lady Sneerwell’s final remark. The play called The School for Scandalis, then, fundamentally wordplay. Indeed, we could say, literature in general has to do with wordplay or – to use a more technical-sounding term – with paronomasia. This is in part what makes it potentially so subversive and disturbing. Could there really be a char- acter called Snake? Or a woman called Lady Sneerwell? What kind of world do they belong to? Literature is a matter of linguistic as well as social scandal. It poses a constant challenge to the realms of so-called ‘good sense’ and represents an affront to what could be called the ideology of seriousness. Paronomasia is indeed so originary a dimension of literary works that one isLaughter 101 tempted to agree with the narrator of Samuel Beckett’s Murphy(1938) and say: ‘In the beginning was the pun’ (41). Even Shakespeare becomes open to criticism on this front. Literary critics may not have much of a reputation for being amusing – but critical indignation at Shakespeare’s soft spot for the ‘quibble’ (or ‘pun’) gives rise to what we think is one of the funniest paragraphs in the history of literary criticism. Here is Samuel Johnson’s fascinating and irresistible paragraph from his Preface to Shakespeare (1765): A quibble is to Shakespeare what luminous vapours are to the traveller; he follows it at all adventures; it is sure to lead him out of his way
		- and sure to engulf him in the mire. It has some malignant power over his mind, and its fascinations are irresistible. Whatever be the dignity or profundity of his disquisition, whether he be enlarging knowledge or exalting affection, whether he be amusing attention with incidents or enchaining it in sus- pense, let but a quibble spring up before him, and he leaves his work unfinished. A quibble is the golden apple for which he will always turn aside from his career or stoop from his elevation. A quibble, poor and barren as it is, gave him such delight that he was content to purchase it by the sacrifice of reason, propriety, and truth. A quibble was to him the fatal Cleopatra for which he lost the world and was content to lose it. (Johnson 1969, 68) It is perhaps difficult not to find the ‘dignity’ and ‘profundity’ of Johnson’s ‘disquisition’ amusing: he quibbles about quibbling in terms as extravagant as any in Shakespeare. In the process he also delightfully intimates what is often so compelling about such wordplay, namely its playful mixing of sex and death: the quibble is the apple of Shakespeare’s I, the obscure object of desire, at once ‘barren’ and ‘the fatal Cleopatra’. We will now consider another, rather different kind of literary work, Geoffrey Chaucer’s ‘The Miller’s Tale’. This is the story, set in Oxford, about the superstitious old carpenter John, his beautiful young wife Alisoun, and their handsome lodger, Nicholas. Along with a rather absurd rival called Absolon, Nicholas is after the young wife. Chaucer’s tale recounts, with superb comic concision, how Nicholas persuades John that the end of the world is coming, in order to distract him so that he can get into bed with the old man’s wife. John ends up with a broken arm, but Nicholas finally fares worse. That same night, Alisoun has already humiliated Absolon: he craves a kiss from her and she agrees, but in the dark Absolon finds himself kissing her arse, not her mouth. When Nicholas tries to repeat this jape, and indeed embellish it with a thundering fart, he receives a burning hot poker up his bum. In order to try to convey what makes Chaucer’s ‘The Miller’s Tale’ one102 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory of the greatest comic poems ever written we could point to the visual comedy of John the Carpenter up in the rooftop cutting the cable and crashing down, convinced that the flood is coming and that he’ll be safe in the ‘kneeding- tubbe’ that will be his mini Noah’s ark. This fall might be seen as a literaliza- tion and structural equivalent of the fall of the tragic hero. In this respect comedy is not the oppositeof tragedy but the same, viewed from a different perspective. While we identify with the tragic hero or heroine, we stand apart from or above the comic victim. Chaucer’s poem, then, offers a clear example of the Hobbesian motif: we laugh because we are not stupid like John the Carpenter. The carpenter falls. We remain where we are, superior, riding high. But we must at the same time acknowledge that all of this is in a sense only happening in language, as something being narrated. And indeed the comic force of ‘The Miller’s Tale’ is very specifically linguistic. It is not only a matter of the brutally eloquent account of John’s cuckolding, or the satirical portrayal of Absolon’s fashion-conscious, prancing character, or the bawdy language of pissing and ‘letting flee’ monumental farts. It is also, and most crucially, that the whole story seems
		- to be structured like a joke condensed from or into the single word, ‘water’. The whole text turns on the double signification of ‘water’: for Nicholas it’s a screamed request for an anodyne to salve his sizzling arse, for John it signifies that the flood is upon them. The two parts of the story are explosively assembled in the wordplay or paronomasia around this single word: The hote culter brende so his toute, And for the smert he wende for to dye. As he were wood, for wo he gan to crye— ‘Help! water! water! help, for Goddes herte!’ This carpenter out of his slomber sterte, And herde oon cryen ‘water!’ as he were wood, And thoghte, ‘Allas, now comth Nowelis flood!’ He sit him up withouten wordes mo, And with his ax he smoot the corde atwo, And doun goth al... (lines 709–18) [The hot poker burnt his bum so badly he thought he was going to die of the pain. Like a lunatic he cried out in woe: ‘Help! Water! Water! Help, for God’s sake!’ Hearing someone madly cry ‘Water!’ the carpenter started out of his sleep and thought ‘Oh no! It’s Noah’s flood!’ He sits up like a shot and cuts the rope with his axe, and every- thing gives way...]Laughter 103 The visual comedy of the fall (whether from the roof in Chaucer, or on a banana skin in The Simpsons), and the accompanying emphasis on high and low, seems to have a ‘funny’ counterpart in the terms of rhetorical figures and tropes. Thus what creates laughter in a text is often either hyperbole (exagger- ation) or litotes (understatement). Some examples of hyperbole would be the sorts of comparative metaphor for which Raymond Chandler’s work is cele- brated. In The Little Sister(1949), for instance, we encounter the gorgeous Miss Gonzales who, Marlowe tells us, ‘smelled the way the Taj Mahal looked by moonlight’ (70), had a ‘mouth as red as a new fire engine’ (158) and who proceeds to make ‘a couple of drinks in a couple of glasses you could almost have stood umbrellas in’ (70). Correspondingly we are told of a man wearing ‘sky-blue gaberdine slacks...and a two-tone leisure jacket which would have been revolting on a zebra’ (84) and a police lieutenant called Maglachan who ‘had a jaw like a park bench’ (167). Litotes, on the other hand, is a pervasive trope in Jonathan Swift’s A Modest Proposal(1729), a text which also illus- trates the fundamental, if in many ways disturbing, power of irony as a comic dimension of literary texts. A Modest Proposal works by understatement and irony. It modestly (or litotically) proposes that a solution to poverty and population management in Ireland might be the killing of small children, then selling and eating them. Outside of literature, we might say, it is possible to entertain perfectly seri- ous ideas about laughter, about jokes, comedy and humour. Thus Freud’s Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious(Freud 1976) is a fascinating work, not only for the similarities it reveals between the structure of jokes and dreams (and by implication, therefore, the structure of works of literature as well), but also for the basic and in some ways disturbing truth it offers as regards the nature of most jokes. Freud argues that jokes tend to be sexist, ‘dirty’, violent, racist: they transgress social taboos and (momentarily) ‘lift’ repression. But literature, conversely, might be defined as the space in which the seriousness of Freud’s or anyone else’s claims are ironized, satirized, parodied or other- wise put into question. For literature is the discourse that is,
		- perhaps more than any other, concerned with questioning and unsettling assumptions about what is serious and what is not serious. Such a questioning and unsettling is often associated with ‘the postmodern’. Postmodern works such as the plays of Samuel Beckett, the poetry of John Ashbery or the fiction of David Foster Wallace present a disquieting, irresolvable mixture of the serious and non-serious, tragic and comic, macabre and laughable. This uncomfortable mixture, however, might also be seen to be at play in Shakespeare’s tragedies, for example, or indeed in Chaucer’s ‘The Miller’s Tale’, which ends with a scene in which everyone is laughing but where it is no longer clear what kind104 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory of laughter it is or who is laughing at what or who. As we have suggested, the study of literature is in various ways policed by a kind of ideology of serious- ness. There is a strong tendency to accept the rules, to adhere to boundaries and categories, to say: the study of literature is a serious affair. Or to say: X is a serious text or a serious moment in a text, whereas Y is not serious. No doubt in the context of the novel, ‘realism’ has been and in many ways continues to be the very embodiment of a certain ‘seriousness’. But the postmodern prompts us to ask various questions in this respect: how seriously, for example, should we take ‘realism’ or ‘reality effects’ in literature? What does seriousness imply or assume? Who are the police and what is the nature of their authority? Laughter can both liberate and mystify. It can be diabolical. It can be at once offensive (laughing at sexist or racist jokes, for instance) and inoffensive (it was ‘only a joke’). It can be cruel, a means of exclusion or of exerting power over people (‘then she just laughed in my face’). But it can also be joyous, a means of sharing and of confirming one’s sense of ‘social community’. As Freud observes of jokes: ‘Every joke calls for a public of its own and laughing at the same jokes is evidence of far-reaching psychical conformity’ (Freud 1976, 203–4). Laughter can be undecidably ‘real’ and ‘unreal’, ‘genuine’ and ‘false’. It can be tiring, it can have you on your hands and knees. It can be uncontrollable, as if with a life of its own. In the engulfment of uncontrollable laughter we lose a sense of who or what we are. We can feel ourselves reduced to nothing. Every pretension to mastery or superiority collapses and dissolves. Laughter becomes the obliteration of identity. It is this obliteration – when one is truly engulfed in laughter, when one is nothing but this laughter – that perhaps gives laughter its strange intimacy with death.

	- ### 13 The Tragic
	  collapsed:: true
		- 13. The tragic Tragedy tears us apart, it shatters our sense of ourselves and the world. The terrifying power of tragedy is suggested by Sir Philip Sidney when he speaks, in An Apology for Poetry(1595), of high and excellent Tragedy, that openeth the greatest wounds, and showeth forth the ulcers that are covered with tissue; that maketh kings fear to be tyrants, and tyrants manifest their tyrannical humours; that, with stirring the affects of admiration and commiseration, teacheth the uncertainty of this world, and upon how weak foundations gilden roofs are builded... (98) Tragedy has to do with strangeness. It involves an overwhelming sense of what Sidney calls ‘the uncertainty of this world’. It involves – as Aristotle suggested, more than 2,300 years ago – a paradoxical combination of emotions, at once pity and fear or (as Sidney says) ‘admiration and commiseration’. Tragedy involves an encounter not only with the death of a character on stage (or in the pages of a book) but also with the idea of our own deaths. Tragedy resists simple explanations. As A.C. Bradley observed, in 1904: ‘tragedy would not be tragedy if it were not a painful mystery’ (38). In this chapter we propose to elucidate this sense of ‘painful mystery’ and to consider some examples of tragic literature, ranging from Shakespeare to the present. When we think of tragedy in the context of literature in English, no doubt we think first of Shakespeare and especially of the ‘great tragedies’, Hamlet (1600–1), Othello(1604), King Lear(1605) and Macbeth(1606). With such plays in mind, and adapting Aristotle’s definition in the Poetics, we could suggest that tragedy comprises four basic elements. The first is that there is aThe tragic 107 central character (the protagonist), someone who is ‘noble’ and with whom we are able to sympathize or identify. The second is that this character should suffer and (preferably) die, and that his or her downfall or death should roughly coincide with the end of the play. The third is that the downfall or death of the central character should be felt by the spectator or reader to be both inevitable and ‘right’ but at the same time in some sense unjustifiable and unacceptable. The fourth element can be referred to as apocalypticism. As we have already indicated, it is not just the death of the protagonist that we are presented with in a tragedy: in identifying with the protagonist who dies, we are also drawn into thinking about our own death. And because the protagon- ist’s death is invariably shattering to other characters, tragedy always engages with a broader sense of death and destruction, a shattering of society or the world as a whole. Without these four elements there cannot be a tragedy. From an Aristotelian perspective we might want to propose additional elements, in particular the notions of peripeteia (‘reversal’), anagnorisis (‘revelation’ or ‘coming to self-knowledge’) and hamartia(‘tragic flaw’ or ‘error’). Peripeteia is a useful term for referring to the reversals or sudden changes in fortune that a character or characters may experience – Lear’s being made homeless, for instance, or Othello’s being transformed by ‘the green-ey’d monster’ (III, iii, 166) of jealousy. Aristotle introduced the term in the context of tragedy, though it is also apposite in other contexts, including comedy (where a char- acter may experience a reversal or sudden change for the good). Anagnorisis refers to the idea of a moment of revelation or recognition, especially the moment when a protagonist experiences a sudden awakening to the truth or to self-knowledge. A tragic work may contain more than one such moment: Hamlet’s life,
		- for instance, might be described as a sort of anagnorisis‘block’, a ghostly series of apparent but ineffective anagnorises starting with his exclamation ‘O my prophetic soul!’ (I, v, 40) on discovering the murderous truth about his father’s death and realizing that this is what he had imagined, deep in his ‘prophetic soul’. Classically, though, a tragedy tends to be construed as having one crucial or climactic moment of anagnorisis. In Sophocles’s Oedipus the King, for example, this can be very specifically located in lines 1306–08, as Oedipus finally realizes that he is himself the criminal he has been seeking: O god— all come true, all burst to light! O light—now let me look my last on you! I stand revealed at last.108 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory Finally, hamartiarefers to the idea of tragic characters having a particular flaw or weakness, or making an error of judgement which leads to their downfall or death. Thus, for example, each of the male protagonists of Shakespeare’s ‘great tragedies’ could be considered in terms of a fundamental moral or psy- chological weakness. Hamlet’s irresolution, Othello’s jealousy, Lear’s pride and Macbeth’s ambition might then be seen as a key element in each of these works. A primary aim in this chapter, however, is to stress the ways in which the tragic entails a fundamental sense of what remains painful, mysterious or uncertain. That is to say, to focus on a character’s ‘tragic flaw’ or ‘error’ tends to suggest something straightforwardly causal: Hamlet’s irresoluteness is the cause of his tragedy and so on. This is not to say that Hamlet’s irresolu- tion or Othello’s jealousy are unimportant. These ‘flaws’ or ‘weaknesses’ are crucial – they are integral to what we think and feel about Hamlet and Othello as characters and therefore to what we think and feel about their tragic fates. But what constitutes the tragic is always stranger and more painful than is suggested by the inevitably moralistic and reductive claim that, for instance, Othello should not have allowed himself to get so jealous and worked up. His jealousy has a crucial but partial and perhaps finally uncertain significance in terms of the tragic power of the play. About to murder his beloved wife, Othello begins what is one of the most anguished and intolerable soliloquies in Shakespeare’s work: ‘It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul; / Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars, / It is the cause’ (V, ii, 1–3). ‘Cause’ here may mean ‘crime’, ‘legal or other case’ or ‘reason’. What is conveyed in these lines is a sense of what cannot be named, a profound strangeness and uncertainty regarding the very sense of this repeated and equivocal word, ‘cause’. Tragedy, we want to suggest, and as Othellopointedly demonstrates, is not only about the sense of particular causes or explan- ations but also, and more importantly, about a painful absence or uncertainty of cause. Tragedy (and here we use the word to embrace both Shakespearean and more recent forms) is not only inimical to the pleasure-button-pushing men- tality of Hollywood or Broadway, but also at odds with the very idea of identity and meaning. As Howard Barker puts it, in a series of aphoristic statements entitled ‘Asides for a Tragic Theatre’ (1986, later published 1989): In tragedy, the audience is disunited...Tragedy is not about reconcilia- tion...Tragedy offends the sensibilities. It drags the unconscious into the public place...After the carnival, after the removal of the masks, you are precisely who you were before. After the tragedy, you are not certain who you are. (Barker
		- 1989, 13)The tragic 109 Tragedy is offensive, it generates disunity and exposes disharmony. Like psychoanalytic theory (itself of course crucially indebted to Sophocles’s Oedipus the King), tragedy makes the unconscious public. It leaves us uncer- tain about our very identities, uncertain about how we feel, about what has happened to us. Finally, there is something apocalyptic about the tragic, not only in the sense that it consistently entails an experience of unmanageable disorder but also in that this experience of disorder is linked to a more general kind of revelation(the meaning of the original Greek word ‘apocalypsis’). The apo- calyptic revelation at the heart of the tragic has to do with a sense that no God or gods are looking down on the world to see that justice is done, or that, if there are gods, they are profoundly careless, indifferent, even sadistic. The heavens may be occupied or vacant, but the world is terrible and makes no sense. To illustrate this idea in relation to King Lear, for example, we could look to a few lines spoken by Albany – addressed to his wife Goneril and concerned with the ‘vile’ behaviour of herself and her sister Regan towards their father, the King: If that the heavens do not their visible spirits Send quickly down to tame these vile offenses, It will come. Humanity must perforce prey on itself Like monsters of the deep. (IV, ii, 46–50) The tragic revelation of King Learconcerns the sense that humanity is indeed monstrous and that there are no ‘visible spirits’ or any other sort of spirits that might properly or profitably be called down from the heavens. One of the shortest, yet perhaps most powerful lines in Shakespeare – ‘It will come’ – is apocalyptic both in terms of the dark revelation of the idea that there are no gods or divine justice and in terms of the sense of an impending or accumulat- ing cataclysm of general destruction and death. The word ‘come’ is crucial here – as indeed it is in the final passages of several of Shakespeare’s tragedies – in part because it resonates with the apocalypticism of the end of the Bible: ‘He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus’ (Revelation 22:20). Tragedy says ‘come’ in a double sense: it summons us, it engages our feelings of sympathy and identification, it demands that our emotions be involved in what is happening. But at the same time tragedy says: we have to suffer, we are going to die, there is no justice and there is no afterlife. It, death and cataclysm, will come. In this way, tragedy engages with the limits of sense, verges on the senseless. Because what tragedy110 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory is about issenseless, meaningless – the unjust and yet unavoidable shattering of life. This would be another way of trying to highlight the mysterious and paradoxical nature of the tragic. When Ludovico says, of the bed displaying the corpses of Othello and Desdemona, ‘Let it be hid’ (Othello, V, ii, 365), Shakespeare’s play paradoxically conceals or encrypts this intolerable sight that tragedy calls us to witness. Correspondingly, in King Lear, the death of Cordelia and Lear’s madness of grief are figured in apocalyptic terms – Kent asks, ‘Is this the promis’d end?’ and Edgar retorts, ‘Or image of that horror?’ (V, iii, 264–5) – but what the tragedy finally and paradoxically reveals is perhaps rather the ethical and spiritual horror of a world in which violence, torture and terror recur unendingly. What is revealed in
		- King Lear, in other words, is the sense that there is no image of the end except as this unendingness. With these rather dark thoughts in mind, let us try to say a little more about the first three elements of a tragedy. First of all, there is the idea of the central character with whom one strongly sympathizes or identifies. ‘Sympathy’ here entails primarily the idea of ‘entering into another’s feelings or mind’ (Chambers). It carries clear connotations of the original Greek terms ‘syn’, with, and ‘pathos’, suffering– that is to say, ‘sympathy’ as ‘suffering with’. It is important to distinguish this from ‘feeling sorry for’. In tragedy, sympathy with a character is indistinguishable from a logic of identification, of identify- ing with that character and experiencing and suffering with her or him. The tragic has to do with a sense of lossof identity – the sense that (in Barker’s words) ‘you are not certain who you are’. We might try to clarify this a little more by remarking on the paradoxical nature of sympathy specifically in relation to drama. Sympathy involves going out of ourselves, and sharing or identifying with the position of another. Putting it slightly differently, it involves a sense of going out of ourselves but, at the same time, putting our- selves on stage. In this respect we have an intriguing example of chiasmus, which can be formulated as follows: there is no drama without sympathy, but there is no sympathy without drama. This proposition may also help us to appreciate why, in historical terms, tragedy has so consistently been associ- ated with the dramatic. More than any other genre, tragedy explores the limits of the experience of sympathy, as it broaches self-obliteration and death. In a manner especially suited to the stage, tragedy is exposure to death – to that extreme of sympathy or identification where, putting oneself on stage, one loses a sense of oneself in the scene, in the figure of the one who dies. It is only on the basis of this first element (sympathy) that the second (the suffering and death of a character) can be described as tragic. This may seem logical enough, but the third element of a tragedy is distinctly paradoxical: the death that occurs at the end of a tragedy is experienced as being at onceThe tragic 111 unavoidable and unjust. This is sometimes talked about as tragic inevitability. Every tragic work will generate a sense of the inevitable or (to use a term that is perhaps too easily loaded with religious connotations) the fated. The tragic invariably concerns a sense of what is foreseeablebut unavoidable. But what is unavoidable (Desdemona in Othellomust die, Tess in Hardy’s novel must die, Ikem and Chris in Achebe’s Anthills of the Savannahmust die) is also unac- ceptable: the tragic seems to involve a peculiar contradiction whereby death is inevitable and therefore (however painfully) appropriate but at the same time unjust, unacceptable and therefore inappropriate. Consider, for example, the moment in the final scene of Hamletwhen Hamlet confides to Horatio: ‘If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come – the readiness is all’ (V, ii, 220–2). At this moment we, like Horatio, may not wantHamlet to die, but at the same time it is hard to imagine that there could be any other outcome to this dark ‘coming’ to ‘readiness’ about which Hamlet is speaking here. The paradoxical nature of this third element of the tragic is analogous to the Aristotelian
		- notion of cartharsis. ‘Catharsis’ is generally understood to refer to the ‘cleansing’ effect of watching (or reading) a tragedy and to involve the combination of two kinds of emotion (pity and fear). The cathartic effects of watching (or reading) are linked to the peculiar fact that tragedy can give pleasure. Likewise, as we noted earlier, the combination of pity and fear seems contradictory. After all, how can one feel pity and fear at the same time? If there were a simple answer to this question we would no longer be thinking within the terms of the tragic, since the tragic comprises precisely this kind of contra- dictoriness of feeling. Pity (pathosin ancient Greek) is understood by Aristotle in terms of a movement towards the spectacle of destruction and death on stage (or page), while fear or terror (phobosin ancient Greek) is a movement away from it. In this way, the spectator or reader is torn apart. And it is in this sense that we can say that the tragic is not rationalizable, rather it is an affront to our desires for meaning and coherence. In thinking about a particular drama or other work in terms of the tragic, then, perhaps the most obvious thing to do in the first instance is to consider the question of sympathy and/or identification. One could for example think about such questions as the following: how does a tragic text generate sym- pathy? Which character or characters elicit our sympathy? What is it that happensin the text that produces a feeling of sympathy or identification on our part? It is not only a question of character (what is he or she likeas an indi- vidual?) and plot (what happens to him or her, the poor sod?) but also, and more fundamentally, a matter of how character and plot are created in lan- guage. In short, it is worth trying to think about which particular passages,112 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory speeches, and even phrases or words help to generate sympathy in the specta- tor or reader. To get a clearer sense of this it may be useful to give an example in which one might reasonably suppose that sympathy is at work, and to offer a paraphrase. Take Lady Macbeth’s words of murderous guilt as overheard by the Doctor and Gentlewoman. (It is, of course, an illustration of the dis- turbing power of this tragedy that Shakespeare is able to make us sympathize or identify with a psychopathic murderer.) Lady Macbeth says: ‘Here’s the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. O, O, O!’ (V, i, 50–2). Lady Macbeth does notsay: ‘Oh what a bore, this smelly blood. Not even industrial cleansing fluid will get this off my hands. Hell, what am I supposed to do?’ There are numerous observations one might make regarding the extraordinary pathos of Lady Macbeth’s language – in its Shakespearean form, that is. The first word she says, ‘Here’, is significant precisely because it draws us into absolute proximity with her. ‘There’ would have a quite different effect. The deictic ‘Here’ suggests how a play such as Macbeth establishes and maintains sympathy or identification through the presentation or indication of psychological interiority, in other words the inside perspective of a given character’s thoughts and feelings. The ‘smell of the blood’ and the felt persistency of the word ‘still’ may be mere somnam- bulistic hallucination, but the spectator or reader is here being presented with intimate, indeed appalling, knowledge of Lady Macbeth’s thoughts and sense-impressions. Through the strangeness of soliloquy
		- (the theatrical device that most explicitly facilitates our access to the interior world of a char- acter’s thoughts and feelings), we feel in turn the pouring out of guilt in ‘All the perfumes of Arabia...’ and the stammering nullity of ‘O, O, O!’ We cannot claim to truly understand or identify with Lady Macbeth (that would be sleep- walking madness), but her language, pitifully overheard by other characters and by spectators or readers alike, generates sympathy. Sympathy, in short, is something that calls to be described and analysed not only at the macro-level of character and plot but also, and more importantly, at the micro-level of indi- vidual words, phrases, sentences. Finally, we could consider the question of the tragic in some of its more contemporary forms. One can think of many sorts of literary works that are tragedies of one kind or another – and often showing obvious conformities with the model we have outlined. But it is also evident that tragedy has under- gone certain changes in the past century or so. There are various reasons for this. One reason has to do with the notion of ‘the death of God’. Tragedy, that is to say, is bound to be different if it is considered, at the outset, from a secular perspective. Shakespearean tragedy might be said to be modern to the extent that it seems to dramatize the terrible revelation of a secular and arbitraryThe tragic 113 world, a purposeless universe of suffering and death (countered only by the quasi-miraculous tenacity of notions of goodness, dignity and justice – with or without religion). Thomas Hardy’s novels – The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), The Woodlanders(1887), Tess of the d’Urbervilles(1891) and Jude the Obscure(1895), for example – might be regarded as limit-texts in this respect: they are remarkably close to the sort of model of tragedy that we have outlined in this chapter but their tragic force consists less in a dramatic revelation that there is no God or ultimate justice and more in an ironic toying with the very grounds of such a revelation. If, as Paul Fussell has argued, irony is the ‘domin- ating form of modern understanding’ (Fussell 1975, 35), this is especially clear in the sort of ironization of tragedy evident in Thomas Hardy’s work. The fact that these novels incorporate allusions to what Hardy calls the Immanent Will, the ‘intangible Cause’ or ‘Unfulfilled Intention’, as well as to more familiar classical deities, is simply part of this ironization. In terms of drama itself, there have been quite traditional examples of the tragic – one might think of Arthur Miller’s great allegorical work, The Crucible(1953), for example – but more characteristic of the past century have been the kind of secular tragicomedies of Chekhov or Beckett. A second reason why tragedy is not what it used to be concerns the trans- formations that have taken place over the past two hundred years or so regard- ing notions of the individual and society. If modern tragedies tend to be about ordinary people rather than kings or queens, they also show how far the lives of such ‘ordinary people’ are bound up, determined and constrained by broader social, economic and political realities. One of the first modern tragedies in European drama, Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House (1879), for example, is not simply about the break-up of the ‘doll’ Nora’s marriage: it is about the ways in which the patriarchal institution and conventions of mar- riage effectively programmethis tragic break-up. Particularly in the wake of Ibsen’s work, in other words, there is a fundamental shift from a classical
		- idea of tragedy as inevitable and beyond human control to the modern idea of a tragedy as something humanly engineered and happening in a world in which something could and should be done, for instance about sexual inequality, racism and so on. In his autobiography, Bertrand Russell remarks that ‘One of the things that makes literature so consoling, is that its tragedies are all in the past, and have the completeness and repose that comes of being beyond the reach of our endeavours’ (Russell 1968, 169). Russell’s observation may be appropriate for thinking about tragedy in its classical modes; but it is quite inadequate and misleading for thinking about modern tragedy. New histor- icist and poststructuralist critics, in particular, have been concerned to under- line what many of the more recent examples of tragic works of literature make114 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory clear, namely that what Russell comfortably refers to as ‘the past’ is precisely what is in question. And if the past is in question, so is the present. Whose past are we talking about? From whose perspective? With whose interests at stake? We could illustrate this by referring briefly to a couple of contempor- ary works of tragic literature. The first example is a novel about the United States. Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye (1970) contains the basic elements of tragedy – even if this includes a modification of Shakespearean ‘suffering and death’ into Morrisonian ‘suffering and terrible abuse’. It is set in Ohio, and the narrative begins in 1941. It recounts the story of a young black girl called Pecola and how she comes to be sexually abused by her grimly named father, Cholly Breedlove. Morrison’s novel may be set in the past but its power as a tragic text consists partly in the fact that it is making an explicit political statement not only about racism in contemporary US society but also about the perception of history itself. The novel involves a lucid but terrible elabora- tion of whythis man called Breedlove should have abused his daughter. By stressing the ways in which Breedlove himself had in the past been racially and physically abused in turn, Morrison’s novel provides a complex historical account of racism and violence. The Bluest Eye is tragic but the villain is paradoxically part of the tragedy. Morrison’s novel broaches a despairing realism quite foreign to Shakespearean tragedy. King Lear concludes with Edgar’s words: The weight of this sad time we must obey, Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say: The oldest hath borne most; we that are young Shall never see so much, nor live so long. (V, ii, 324–7) His words may sound like a hollow formality or formalism – even as they iron- ically refer to the importance of saying ‘what we feel, not what we ought to say’ – but there is at least an implicit affirmation here of some kind of future. Toni Morrison’s novel concludes more blankly: ‘It’s too late. At least on the edge of my town, among the garbage and the sunflowers of my town, it’s much, much, much too late’ (190). The second example is Chinua Achebe’s Anthills of the Savannah(1987). Achebe’s novel is at once more and less than a tragedy in a classical or Shakespearean sense. It is set in a semi-fictional present-day African state and recounts the process by which one of the protagonists, a newspaper editor called Ikem Osodi, is ‘fatally wounded’ (169) by the military authorities, and the other male protagonist, the Commissioner for Information, Chris Oriko, gets shot by a policeman
		- who is apparently about to rape a schoolgirl. The narrator adopts the perspective of Chris’s lover, the mourning Beatrice:The tragic 115 The explanation of the tragedy of Chris and Ikem in terms of petty human calculation or personal accident had begun to give way in her throbbing mind to an altogether more terrifying but more plausible theory of premed- itation. The image of Chris as just another stranger who chanced upon death on the Great North Road or Ikem as an early victim of a waxing police state was no longer satisfactory. Were they not in fact trailed travellers whose journeys from start to finish had been carefully programmed in advance by an alienated history? If so, how many more doomed voyagers were already in transit or just setting out, faces fresh with illusions of duty-free travel and happy landings ahead of them? (220) Though in many respects tragic, Anthills of the Savannahsuggests a powerful circumscription and questioning of classical notions of tragedy – not least in the light of what Achebe calls ‘an alienated history’. Like Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, it is an explicitly political novel, directly focusing on the contem- porary while exploring ways of rethinking the past. Both novels suggest, in their different ways, the extent to which tragedy is – humanly and unaccept- ably – ‘carefully programmed’. In its broadest implications, the ‘alienated history’ to which Achebe’s novel refers is perhaps alien to the very forms of Western thought, prompting us to reflect on the ways in which ‘history’ and ‘tragedy’ are themselves Western concepts. Further reading Aristotle’s Poeticsis the single most important account of tragedy in Western history. For a rich and stimulating elaboration of Aristotelian notions, see Elizabeth S. Belfiore’s Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion(1992). Also on the peculiar relations between the tragic and pleasurable, see A.D. Nuttall’s Why Does Tragedy Give Pleasure?(1996) and Terry Eagleton’s Sweet Violence(2003). John Drakakis and Naomi Liebler’s Tragedy(1998) has a very useful introduction and provides an excellent range of critical material, from Hegel to Derrida. For a psychoanalytic understanding of tragedy, see André Green’s now classic The Tragic Effect (1979). Of related interest, Heinz Politzer’s Freud and Tragedy(2006) explores Freud’s work on and in terms of the tragic, from Oedipus to Macbeth. For an influential account of how the sense of the tragic in the modern world has all but disappeared, see George Steiner’s The Death of Tragedy (1961). And by way of equally influential riposte, see Raymond Williams’s Modern Tragedy(1969), which vigorously demonstrates how tragedy has changed and will continue to do so. K.M. Newton’s Modern Literature and the Tragic(2008) focuses on tragic drama from Ibsen through to the Theatre of the Absurd and beyond. Rethinking116 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory Tragedy, ed. Rita Felski (2008) collects a range of essays on topics from Euripides to Sebald. Specifically on Shakespeare, Shakespearean Tragedy (1992), ed. John Drakakis, contains a good deal of valuable critical material, while Jonathan Dollimore’s Radical Tragedy: Religion, Ideology and Power in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries(3rdedn, 2004) is a fasci- nating, now classic study.
	- ### 14 History
	  collapsed:: true
		- 14. History What is the relationship between a literary text and history? Broadly speaking critics have produced four answers to this question: 1. Literary texts belong to no particular time, they are universal and tran- scend history: the historical context of their production and reception has no bearing on the literary work which is aesthetically autonomous, having its own laws, being a world unto itself. 2. The historical context of a literary work – the circumstances surrounding its production – is integral to a proper understanding of it: the text is pro- duced within a specific historical context but in its literariness it remains separate from that context. 3. Literary works can help us to understand the time in which they are set: realist texts in particular provide imaginative representations of specific historical moments, events or periods. 4. Literary texts are bound up with other discourses and rhetorical struc- tures: they are part of a history that is still in the process of being written. These four models of literature and history characterize various schools of criticism. The first model is often associated with new criticism or more generally with formalism, especially influential in literary studies in the middle decades of the twentieth century. New critics are concerned with literary texts as artifacts which transcend the contingencies of any particular time or place and which resist what they see as a reduction of the aesthetic whole to a specific historical context. Thus, for example, R.S. Crane argues in an essay first published in 1935 that literary history is essentially part of ‘the general history of culture’ (Crane 1967, 20), while a ‘program of literary studies based118 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory on criticism’ would focus on ‘imaginative works considered with respect to those qualities which can truly be said to be timeless...in the sense that they can be adequately discerned and evaluated in the light of general principles quite apart from any knowledge of their origin or historical filiation’ (18). The second model is the kind of approach favoured by philological or what we might call ‘background’ critics. Such critics are concerned to describe and analyse literary texts through a consideration of their historical ‘background’, whether biographical, linguistic, cultural or political. The titles of Basil Willey’s two classic studies from 1934 and 1940 respectively indicate this approach: The Seventeenth Century Background: Studies in the Thought of the Age in Relation to Poetry and Religion and The Eighteenth Century Background: Studies on the Idea of Nature in the Thought of the Period.For such critics, knowledge of a literary text’s historical circumstances forms the basis for an understanding of that text. The third model tends to be associated more with traditional historical scholarship than with literary criticism, as it assumes that literary texts are in some respect subordinate to their histor- ical context. It also tends to assume that literary texts provide undistorted ‘reflections’ of their time. Thus, for example, in his book Religion and the Decline of Magic(1971), Keith Thomas appeals to Shakespeare’s works on a number of occasions to justify his arguments. Discussing the practice of curs- ing, Thomas points out that ‘In Shakespeare’s plays, the curses pronounced by the characters invariably work’, and argues that this is ‘not just for dramatic effect’ but that ‘it was a moral necessity that the poor and the injured should be believed to have this power of retaliation when all else failed’ (Thomas 1971, 507). We might call this model the ‘reflective’ approach. The last model is associated with a new kind of concern with the historical dimensions of literary studies
		- particularly since the early 1980s. This model is specifically associated with new historicist critics in the United States and with cultural materialist critics in Britain (for convenience, we shall use the term ‘new his- toricist’ in this chapter to cover both varieties). In both cases, this new interest in history has been refracted through the concerns of both Marxism and post- structuralism to produce a complex model of the literary. In this chapter we shall focus on strategies of reading developed by new historicism in order to consider ways in which literary texts may be thought about in historical terms. New historicists argue that to ask about the relationship between literature and history is the wrong question. The form of the question presupposes that there is literature on the one side and history on the other. Despite their dif- ferences, ‘new critics’, ‘background critics’ and ‘reflectionists’ tend to rely on precisely such a polarity: they assume that the categories of ‘literature’ and ‘history’ are intrinsically separate. They distinguish, more or less explicitly,History 119 between the need for the interpretation of literary texts on the one hand, and the transparency of history on the other. In an essay entitled ‘Literary Theory, Criticism, and History’ (1961), for example, René Wellek argues that ‘Literary study differs from historical study in having to deal not with docu- ments but with monuments’ and that the literary critic ‘has direct access to his [sic] object’, while the historian ‘has to reconstruct a long-past event on the basis of eye-witness accounts’ (Wellek 1963, 14–15). For old-historicist critics, history is not so much textual as more simply a series of empirically verifiable events. And they also assume that it is possible for our know- ledge of both historical events and literary texts to be detached and objective, outside the forces of history. New historicism may be understood as a reaction against such presupposi- tions: put briefly, it may be defined as a recognition of the extent to which history is textual, as a rejection of the autonomy of the literary text and as an attempted displacement of the objectivity of interpretation in general. Stephen Greenblatt, the critic who is often seen as the instigator of new his- toricism, remarks in an essay entitled ‘Toward a Poetics of Culture’ that ‘methodological self-consciousness is one of the distinguishing marks of the new historicism in cultural studies as opposed to a historicism based upon faith in the transparency of signs and interpretive procedures’ (Greenblatt 1990a, 158). In the first place, then, new historicism involves a questioning of the critics’ own position and interpretative procedures. New historicists argue that the production of literary texts is a cultural practice different only in its specific mode or formulation from other practices – from furniture-making to teaching to warfare to printing. According to this reasoning, no absolute distinction can be made between literary and other cultural practices. As Stephen Greenblatt puts it, art is ‘made up along with other products, prac- tices, discourses of a given culture’ (Greenblatt 1988, 13). Literary texts are embedded within the social and economic circumstances in which they are produced and consumed. But what is important for new historicists is that these circumstances are not stable in themselves and are susceptible to being rewritten and transformed. From this perspective, literary texts are part of a larger circulation of social energies, both products of and influences on a par- ticular culture or ideology. What is new about new historicism in particular is its recognition that history is the ‘history of the present’ (to borrow a phrase from the godfather of new
		- historicism, Michel Foucault), history is in the making rather than being monumental and closed, history is radically open to transformation and rewriting. New historicists argue that any ‘knowledge’ of the past is necessarily medi- ated by textsor, to put it differently, that history is in many respects textual.120 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory In this, at least, they are in agreement with Jacques Derrida who declared in Of Grammatologyin 1967 that ‘The age already in the pastis in fact constituted in every respect as a text’ (Derrida 1976, lxxxix). A number of major con- sequences follow from such an assertion. In the first place, there can be no knowledge of the past without interpretation. (This is also one of the ways in which new historicism is specifically Nietzschean: as Nietzsche declared in The Will to Power(1901), ‘facts is precisely what there is not, only inter- pretations’ (Nietzsche 1968, section 481).) Just as literary texts need to be read, so do the ‘facts’ ofhistory. Thus, theorists such as Hayden White suggest that our knowledge of the past is determined by particular narrative configura- tions – that in talking about the past we tell stories. ‘Properly understood’, White remarks, histories ought never to be read as unambiguous signs of the events they report, but rather as symbolic structures, extended metaphors, that ‘liken’ the events reported in them to some form with which we have already become familiar in our literary culture...By the very constitution of a set of events in such a way as to make a comprehensible story out of them, the historian charges those events with the symbolic significance of a com- prehensible plot structure. (White 1978, 91–2) In this respect, the strategies and tools of critical analysis – the consideration of figures and tropes, a critical awareness of the rhetorical elements of lan- guage and so on – are as appropriate to a critical study of history as they are to literary studies. From a new historicist perspective, any reading of a literary text is a ques- tion of negotiation, a negotiation between text and reader within the context of a history or histories that cannot be closed or finalized. Indeed, Stephen Greenblatt argues that literary works themselves should be understood in terms of negotiation, rather than in the conventional (Romantic) sense of a ‘pure act of untrammeled creation’ – negotiations which are ‘a subtle, elusive set of exchanges, a network of trades and trade-offs, a jostling of competing representations’ (Greenblatt 1988, 7). ‘The work of art’, declares Greenblatt, ‘is the product of a negotiation between a creator or class of creators, equipped with a complex, communally shared repertoire of conventions, and the insti- tutions and practices of society’ (Greenblatt 1990a, 158). Greenblatt and other new historicist critics reject any attempt to produce a ‘whole’ or final reading and argue for readings which are apparently disjunctive or frag- mented. Similarly, questioning the boundaries of text and world, of art and society, such critics work ‘at the margins of the text’ in order to gain ‘insight into the half-hidden cultural transactions through which great works of art areHistory 121 empowered’ (Greenblatt 1988, 4). A critic might study legal documents, for example, or arguments concerning the politics of kingship, or handbooks on the education of children, or accounts of exotic travels and exploration and so on, in order to get a purchase on a particular work of literature. But such texts are not to be construed as either the background or the essential key to understanding the literary text. Rather, like plays, poems and novels, they are to be
		- understood as texts through which questions of politics and power can be negotiated. Such negotiation concerns, not least, our reading. If ‘history’ necessarily entails interpretation, then such acts of reading will themselves be embedded within a particular social and cultural situation. There is no escape from his- tory even if this history is regarded as multiple and in a process of unceasing transformation. New historicism argues that we are inescapably implicated – even in the fantasy of academic objectivity and detachment – in structures and strategies of power. Power is produced and reproduced in research, teaching and learning as it is in any other practice or discourse. As Michel Foucault remarked in his 1976 Introduction to The History of Sexuality, power is ‘omnipresent’. It is as ‘the moving substrate of force relations which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly engender states of power’, states of power which are, however, ‘always local and unstable’. ‘Power’, Foucault goes on, ‘is every- where’ (Foucault 1981, 93). In order to consider how such an approach might work in practice, we propose to discuss a poem by the English Romantic poet William Wordsworth entitled ‘Alice Fell, or Poverty’. The poem was written on the 12th and 13th March 1802, and first published in 1807. It is a seemingly uncomplicated account of an incident that was recounted to Wordsworth by his friend Robert Grahame. As the subtitle indicates, the poem presents itself as an allegory concerning poverty: The Post-boy drove with fierce career, For threat’ning clouds the moon had drowned; When suddenly I seemed to hear A moan, a lamentable sound. 5 As if the wind blew many ways I heard the sound, and more and more: It seemed to follow with the Chaise, And still I heard it as before. At length I to the Boy called out, 10 He stopped his horses at the word;122 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory But neither cry, nor voice, nor shout, Nor aught else like it could be heard. The Boy then smacked his whip, and fast The horses scampered through the rain; 15 And soon I heard upon the blast The voice, and bade him halt again. Said I, alighting on the ground, ‘What can it be, this piteous moan?’ And there a little Girl I found, 20 Sitting behind the Chaise, alone. ‘My Cloak!’ the word was last and first, And loud and bitterly she wept, As if her very heart would burst; And down from off the Chaise she leapt. 25 ‘What ails you, Child?’ She sobbed, ‘Look here!’ I saw it in the wheel entangled, A weather beaten Rag as e’er From any garden scare-crow dangled. ’Twas twisted betwixt nave and spoke; 30 Her help she lent, and with good heed Together we released the Cloak; A wretched, wretched rag indeed! ‘And wither are you going, Child, Tonight along these lonesome ways?’ 35 ‘To Durham’ answered she half wild – ‘Then come with me into the chaise.’ She sate like one past all relief; Sob after sob she forth did send In wretchedness, as if her grief 40 Could never, never, have an end. ‘My child, in Durham do you dwell?’ She checked herself in her distress, And said, ‘My name is Alice Fell; I’m fatherless and motherless.History 123 45 And I to Durham, Sir, belong.’ And then, as if the thought would choke Her very heart, her grief grew strong; And all was for her tattered Cloak. The chaise drove on; our journey’s end 50 Was nigh; and, sitting by my side, As if she’d lost her only friend She wept,
		- nor would be pacified. Up to the Tavern-door we post; Of Alice and her grief I told; 55 And I gave money to the Host, To buy a new Cloak for the old. ‘And let it be a duffil grey, As warm a cloak as man can sell!’ Proud Creature was she the next day, 60 The little Orphan, Alice Fell! From a new historicist perspective we might try to situate this poem in relation to other contemporary discourses which deal with poverty, charity and prop- erty. We could, for example, investigate the rhetorical strategies and discursive conventions of debates surrounding the Poor Law, economics, poverty and charity at the turn of the nineteenth century. One such text is Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations, first published in 1776 and perhaps the most influen- tial work of political economy of the time. In this book, Smith twice refers to beggars, once when he argues that ‘Before the invention of the art of printing, a scholar and a beggar seem to have been terms very nearly synonymous’ (Smith 1986, 237), and once when he considers beggars as the only people who do not take part in the circulation of exchange and barter. In this latter passage, from the second chapter of his multi-volume work, Smith argues that there is ‘a certain propensity in human nature’ which is ‘to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another’ (117). It is this ‘propensity’ which distin- guishes humans from animals: ‘When an animal wants to obtain something either of a man or of another animal, it has no other means of persuasion but to gain the favour of those whose service it requires’ (118). But humans – unlike animals, consistently dependent on others – cannot constantly expect others’ benevolence. Instead, a man must ‘interest [another person’s] self-love in his favour’: ‘Nobody but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the bene- volence of his fellow-citizens’ (118–19). Although Smith goes on to say that124 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory even beggars take part in the circulation of monetary exchange by buying goods with the money that they are given, in this extraordinary passage he has managed to dehumanize beggars, to put them outside of humanity, on the level of the animal. By arguing that human relations are relations of exchange, based on the principle of ‘self-love’, however, Smith suggests an apparent paradox in the discourse of charity: he claims that ‘the charity of well-disposed people’ supplies the beggar with ‘the whole fund of his subsistence’ (119), but does not explain whysuch people should give to beggars. According to his own arguments, people would only give to beggars if they were to gain something in return. There is, in this sense, no pure gift, no possibility of a gift. A num- ber of significant rhetorical manoeuvres, then, may be seen to be at work in Smith’s discourse of charity and begging. In the first place, beggars are dehumanized. Secondly, charity becomes a paradoxical or perverse, even an impossible act. Thirdly, by saying ‘a beggar choosesto depend’, Smith implies freedom of choice where economic necessity may be at stake. Finally, and most generally, Smith makes it clear that questions of charity and begging are part of a larger discourse of property and the exchange of property, indeed, part of a specific ideology of free-market liberalism. We might think about these points in relation to Wordsworth’s poem for, although Alice Fell does not actually beg and is not referred to as a beggar, the poem puts her in the position of a beggar and is specifically
		- concerned with that particular kind of exchange of property named ‘charity’. What we might then seek to do is not to produce a thematic reading of the poem: rather, we might consider how the rhetorical strategies at work in Smith’s account of beggars, property and charity are reproduced and transformed in those of the poem. We might start by thinking about ways in which the poem articulates questions of property. Property in ‘Alice Fell’ is not simply a question of the cloak, but of poetry itself as property. The very origins of the narrative are bound up with questions of ownership in that the story originated with Wordsworth’s friend Robert Grahame. Moreover, Dorothy Wordsworth, the poet’s sister, wrote an account of the same incident in her journal before Wordsworth wrote his poem. Dorothy’s account goes as follows: Mr. Graham said he wished Wm had been with him the other day – he was riding in a post chaise and he heard a strange cry that he could not under- stand, the sound continued and he called to the chaise driver to stop. It was a little girl that was crying as if her heart would burst. She had got up behind the chaise and her cloak had been caught by the wheel and was jammed in and it hung there. She was crying after it. Poor thing. Mr. Graham took herHistory 125 into the chaise and the cloak was released from the wheel but the child’s misery did not cease for her cloak was torn to rags; it had been a miserable cloak before, but she had no other and it was the greatest sorrow that could befal her. Her name was Alice Fell. She had no parents, and belonged to the next Town. At the next Town Mr. G. left money with some respectable people in the town to buy her a new cloak. (Wordsworth 1984, 702) As with a number of William’s most famous lyrics, ‘Alice Fell’ resembles Dorothy’s journalistic account in many ways: both poem and journal entry are concerned with the strangeness of the girl’s cry, with the girl’s continuing misery, with the ragged state of her cloak. More specifically, there are numer- ous verbal echoes of the journal entry in William’s poem, most strikingly, the poem’s ‘she wept, / As if her heart would burst’ and the journal’s ‘crying as if her heart would burst’. In this respect, William may be said to have appro- priated the story from his friend and from his sister. This leads us to the ques- tion of what property it is that constitutes this text as a poem. Is it properly a poem? How is it different from Grahame’s oral account or from Dorothy’s journal entry? And where does the poem originate, who owns it and author- izes it? We might want to follow these questions through to an investigation of the institution of literature itself. How is the canon produced, for example, what factors are at work in canon-formation in England such that women’s diaries have tended to be excluded, canonically marginalized? Can it be said that in choosing the form of the journal-entry to record the story Dorothy is excluding herself from the public discourse of literature? How is Dorothy’s account both reproduced and effaced in William’s poem and in the critical tradition, and why? Rather differently, we could argue that Dorothy’s diary entry is not simply supplementary to the poem but is an essential part of it. Indeed, it becomes difficult to distinguish property as regards the cloak and property as regards the Wordsworths. In these
		- respects, questions of property cannot be considered to be simply the context or the thematic focus of the poem: the poem originates in certain problematic exchanges, transfers or gifts of narrative property. The poem is also ‘about’ an exchange of property. The girl loses her cloak in the wheel of the carriage, and the speaker gives her enough money to buy a new one. But along with this exchange go a series of property disturbances. The girl’s proper name, Alice Fell, for example, is curious. It is not a name Wordsworth invented, it seems. But is it ‘historical’ or ‘literary’? The poem, indeed, exacerbates the sense of uncertainty regarding the strange properties of this proper name. Not only is it transferred from the title to the main body of the poem, or from the girl to the poem, but it also has a curious grammatical126 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory status in itself: it is suspended between a name and a minimal sentence, a kind of mini-narrative in itself – Alice fell. The poem is not only called ‘Alice Fell’, but is also about the fall of Alice. And once we recognize that there is something strange about the girl’s name, we might also notice that ‘Alice Fell’ is haunted by the figure of a ‘fallen woman’, a woman outside ‘respectable’ society. Dorothy’s text seems to pick up on this in its use of the verb ‘befal’, just prior to naming the girl herself. Conversely, we may recall that ‘fell’ also means the skin or hide of an animal, so that Alice might be like her cloak, a kind of rag, caught up and torn apart by the moving carriage. Finally, ‘fell’ as ‘wild’, as ‘fierce, savage, cruel, ruthless, dreadful, terrible’ or ‘intensely painful’ and even (of poison) ‘deadly’, or ‘shrewd, clever, cunning’ (OED) gives us a sense of the outcast, inhuman, dangerous, improper nature of this figure, and perhaps partly explains her – and the poem’s – haunt- ing power: she is, as the narrator himself declares, ‘half wild’ (l.35). The dehumanization at work in Adam Smith’s account of beggars is also wildly at work in Wordsworth’s poem. If the poem is about the exchange of property, it is also about the question of charity. Every act of charity may be understood as an implicit assertion that the end of suffering is possible. Dorothy’s account of the incident recognizes that, after the girl’s cloak was released, her ‘misery did not cease’. One of the key stanzas of Wordsworth’s poem in this respect is stanza 10: She sate like one past all relief; Sob after sob she forth did send In wretchedness, as if her grief Could never, never, have an end. The phrases ‘like’ and ‘as if’ seem to deny the unspeakable possibility that the girl really is ‘past all relief’, and that her ‘grief / Could never, never, have an end’. But much of the force of the poem may be said to reside precisely in this terrifying possibility – that nothing can be done, that charity cannot finally help. In this respect, it is significant that unlike Dorothy’s account, the poem ends in a blustering statement of self-satisfaction: in the final stanza, the girl is said to be ‘proud’ on account of her new cloak. But the girl’s poverty and orphanhood remain and the pride appears to be as much a projection of the speaker’s emotions as the girl’s. The speakerapparently does have reason to be proud – he can feel proud of his charitable action. Attributing pride to the girl simply increases the speaker’s
		- own reasons to be proud. It might be argued that the poem works against itself, implicitly exposing the self-deceptive nature of the charitable act. Given this logic of projection, the poem clearlyHistory 127 suggests that self-deception is necessary to charity or that, in Adam Smith’s terms, there is no pure gift, that in giving the cloak, the speaker receives the satisfaction of pride. Moreover, the poem’s triumphant ending implies that charity can end suffering. But this sense of triumph and of an ending are simultaneously undone: we must give and to do so we must believe that our gift will help to end suffering, but suffering is never-ending. The hardly audible, ghostly historical counter-voice of the poem cries that, as an orphan, Alice Fell cannot but suffer (etymologically, ‘orphan’ means ‘one who has lost’). Her suffering is never-ending because it cannot be ended. Unlike the speaker, who is on a journey that will end (see line 49, ‘our journey’s end’), the suffering of Alice Fell has no end. Just as the speaker is haunted by a strange voice at the beginning of the poem, so he is haunted by the uncanny disembodied voice of suffering, haunted by what he knows but cannot know – that suffering and the improper or ‘fell’ (wild, inhuman, fallen) disturbances of property are never-ending. Stephen Greenblatt argues that culture ‘is a particular network of negotia- tions for the exchange of material goods, ideas, and – through institutions like enslavement, adoption, or marriage – people’. Greenblatt also contends that ‘Great writers are precisely masters of these codes, specialists in cultural exchange’ (Greenblatt 1990b, 229–30). Our account has sought to locate Wordsworth’s poem in relation to the discourses of property and charity as articulated in one particular text. Wordsworth, we might say, is a master of – and is mastered by – the codes of property and charity. New historicism seeks to explore such mastery, while remaining alert to ways in which such codes continue to play themselves out in the discourses of the present – including, not least, the discourses of history and criticism.

	- ### 15 Me
	  collapsed:: true
		- 15. Me Who are we? What am I? What is an ‘I’? What does it mean to say ‘me’? What is the relationship between an ‘I’ in a literary text and an ‘I’ out- side it? One of the central ideas of this book is literature’s capacity to question, defamiliarize and even transform the sense of who or what we are. In the next few pages we would like to elaborate further on this, by trying to look at the nature of personal identity or ‘me’ both in broadly historical and theoretical terms and more specifically in terms of what literary texts themselves suggest. In Flannery O’Connor’s story ‘Revelation’ (1961) a woman called Mrs Turpin has a traumatic and bizarre reaction when a strange girl sitting in a doctor’s waiting room tells her: ‘Go back to hell where you came from, you old wart hog’ (217). Mrs Turpin is scandalized by this statement and that same evening, back at the farm, by herself, hosing down the pigs, she demands an explanation. Being Christian and superstitious (as well as grotesquely racist and class-prejudiced), Mrs Turpin regards the girl’s words as a message from God: ‘What do you send me a message like that for?’ she said in a low fierce voice, barely above a whisper but with the force of a shout in its concentrated fury. ‘How am I a hog and me both?’ (222) What is striking here is not only the woman’s confusion and indignation at the apparently contradictory idea that she might be a human being and an old wart hog at the same time, but also the fact that her ‘fury’ is expressed in a direct, personal address to God. Mrs Turpin’s sense of outrage becomes outrageous in turn, as her questions addressed to God culminate in a questioning ofGod: ‘A final surge of fury shook her and she roared, “Who do you think you are?”’130 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory (223) The strangeness of putting this question to God comes from the fact that it is a question that should properly, perhaps, only be asked of another human. Only humans are supposed to be able to reflect on who they are and at the same time be obliged to take seriously a questioning of their own identity. If the question ‘Who do you think you are?’ is one that cannot or should not be asked of God, nor is it a question one would normally ask of a wart hog. In this respect it would seem that there is something characteristically human about the question. ‘Who do you think you are?’ is the question that humans ask of others and try to answer about themselves. As Socrates said, ‘The unexam- ined life is not worth living’ (Plato 1961, (Apology, 38a)). And the definition of being human must remain in the form of a questioning: Mrs Turpin’s ‘concen- trated fury’ is, in this respect, pitifully, comically human. At the same time, it could be said that this question (‘Who do you think you are?’) is most clearly raised and most fully explored in works ofliterature. This might in fact allow us to formulate another general definition: literature is the space in which questions about the nature of personal identity are most provocatively articulated. For many decades literary critics have talked about ‘the person’ and ‘the individual’. In more recent years, however, there has been a tendency to refer to ‘the human subject’ or just ‘the subject’. This may sound jargonistic but there are good reasons, in fact, for talking about ‘the subject’ rather than, say,
		- ‘the person’ or ‘the individual’. The French post- structuralist Michel Foucault has written: ‘There are two meanings of the word “subject”: subject to someone else by control and dependence, and tied to one’s own identity by a conscience or self-knowledge’ (Foucault 1983, 212, cited by During 1992, 153). The word ‘person’, by contrast, perhaps too easily retains connotations of the ‘I’ or ‘me’ as detached from everything, a free agent. Likewise, the term ‘individual’ (etymologically from the Latin individuus, ‘undivided’ or ‘not divisible’) suggests a sense of the ‘I’ as simply free, as being at one with itself and autonomous or self-ruling. It is this idea of the sovereignty of the ‘I’ that Freud gestures towards and ironizes when he speaks of ‘His Majesty the Ego’ (Freud 1985f, 138). The term ‘subject’ is useful, then, in that it encourages a more critical atten- tiveness to the ways in which the ‘I’ is notautonomous, to the fact that it does not exist in a sort of vacuum. Rather an ‘I’ or ‘me’ is always subjectto forces and effects both outside itself (environmental, social, cultural, economic, educational, etc.) and ‘within’ itself (in particular in terms of what is called the unconscious or, in more recent philosophical terms, otherness). We are subjects in the sense of being ‘subject to’ others ‘by control or dependence’ (in Foucault’s phrase) right from birth and even before: not only are we radically dependent on the father who sires us and the mother who bears us (or on theirMe 131 various surrogates), but also on the environment (ecological, economic, familial, social, etc.) into which we are born, as well as on the multiple forms of authority and government which condition our upbringing. A ‘me’ born to a single mother in Soweto is not the same kind of‘me’ as a ‘me’ born to a duchess in Kensington, but they are both in their different ways subjects. Of course if the Kensington ‘me’ had been in line for the throne, things would have looked slightly different: in Britain, at least, one is subject not only to the authority of one’s parent or parents, one’s local authorities, the police and central govern- ment, but also – at least on paper – to the Queen (thus one is ‘a British subject’) and, beyond her, to the Christian God. That, then, is one way in which every ‘I’ is necessarily and fundamentally a subject. Rather differently, being a sub- ject has specifically to do with language. You cannot be an ‘I’ without having a proper name, and in English-speaking countries you usually acquire a proper name around the time of birth or even before. We are born into language, we are born – more precisely – into patriarchal language, into being identified by a patronym, by a paternal proper name. (Even the mother’s maiden name is, of course, a patronym.) We are also endowed with a forename and again this is not something wechoose, it is something to which we are subject– even if, in Britain for example, people do legally have the right to change their names at the age of 18. Juliet’s complaint is haunting and even tragic precisely because it highlights the way in which we are subject tonames, even if we wish to ignore or disown them: Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. (Romeo and Juliet, II, ii, 33–6) More broadly, questions of personal or individual identity are indissoci- ably bound up with language.
		- We may like to suppose that there is some ‘me’ outside language or that there is some way of thinking about ourselves which involves a non-linguistic ‘me’. But the idea of this non-linguistic ‘me’ must found itself in language – beginning with the name itself, or with the words ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘mine’, ‘myself’ and so on. We cannot, in any meaningfulway, escape the fact that we are subject tolanguage. As Jacques Derrida has put it: ‘From the moment that there is meaning there are nothing but signs. We think only in signs’ (Derrida 1976, 50). We can also consider this topic from a more explicitly historical perspec- tive. The idea of the ‘I’ or ‘me’, in other words, is not unchanging and132 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory unchangeable. It is in many respects historically and ideologically deter- mined. The way we think about ‘I’ today is inevitably different from the way in which ‘I’ was thought about and defined in, say, seventeenth-century France by René Descartes. The principle of the Cartesian cogito(‘I think therefore I am’) – that is to say, the model of the rational subjectwhich Descartes theor- izes in his Discourse on Method(1637; 1977) – in many respects continues to govern Western thinking. But there are other ways of thinking, and other ways of thinking about thinking. In the mid-twentieth century, for example, the German philosopher Martin Heidegger declared: ‘Thinking begins only when we have come to know that reason, glorified for centuries, is the most stiffnecked adversary of thought’ (Heidegger 1977, 112, cited by Judovitz 1988, 186). Likewise, and more recently, Jacques Derrida has been consistently concerned to demonstrate that, as he puts it: ‘reason is only one species of thought – which does not mean that thought is “irrational”’ (Derrida 1983, 16). But perhaps the most obvious way of illustrating the changes over the past century in thinking about thinking, and in thinking about the model of the rational subject, is in terms of psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis has changed the way in which we are obliged to think about ‘the subject’. In the light of the psychoanalytic theory of the unconscious, the proposition ‘cogito, ergo sum’ (‘I think, therefore I am’) becomes manifestly problematic. I do not, and per- haps strictly speaking never can, know precisely why or how I think what I think, if only because of the extent to which what I think is necessarily deter- mined by forces and effects of which I am (in many ways thankfully) unaware. In a short essay written as an encyclopedia entry on ‘Psychoanalysis’ first pub- lished in 1923, Freud suggests that the unconscious is evident not only in dreams but in such events as the temporary forgetting of familiar words and names, for- getting to carry out prescribed tasks, everyday slips of the tongue and of the pen, misreadings, losses and mislayings of objects, certain errors, instances of apparently accidental self-injury, and finally habitual movements carried out seemingly without intention or in play, tunes hummed ‘thoughtlessly’, and so on. (Freud 1986, 136–7) The significance of Freud’s theory of the unconscious thus consists in the demonstration that the subject who thinks (the subject of ‘I think’) is com- posed of forces and effects which are at least in part unconscious. ‘I’, let us remind ourselves, is not ‘God’ – even if it may be subject to fantasies of being so.Me 133 Psychoanalysis, then, has been a particularly disturbing but valuable dis- course because it has promoted an awareness of the extent to which any ‘I’ or human subject is decentred: I, in other words, can never
		- be simply or precisely who or what I think. What makes this idea disturbing and at the same time valuable is that it involves a dislocation of notions of human mastery and autonomy of self. It introduces instead the humility of recognizing that the human subject is not centred in itself, let alone centred in relation to the surrounding world or solar system. In an essay on ‘The Resistances to Psychoanalysis’ (1925), Freud talks about the ‘emotional’ difficulties people have in accepting the ideas of psychoanalysis and draws analogies between this and the theories of Darwin and Copernicus. In the case of psychoanalysis, he says, ‘powerful human feelings are hurt by the subject-matter of the theory. Darwin’s theory of descent met with the same fate, since it tore down the barrier that had been arrogantly set up between men and beasts.’ Freud goes on to suggest that ‘the psychoanalytic view of the relation of the conscious ego to an overpowering unconscious was a severe blow to human self-love’, and that, ‘as the psychological blow to men’s narcissism’, it compares ‘with the biological blow delivered by the theory of descent and the earlier cosmolo- gicalblow aimed at it by the discovery of Copernicus’ (Freud 1986, 272–3). In this sense, psychoanalysis complements the Copernican revolution and nineteenth-century evolutionary theory in providing a powerful critique of anthropocentric or humanist values and ideas. Psychoanalysis demonstrates in uncomfortably clear terms how the ‘arrogance’ or narcissism of anthro- pocentrism – that is to say, every kind of thinking, including every kind of philosophy and politics, which puts the human at the centre of the earth and solar system, if not of the universe – is both unwarranted and unsustainable. The Cartesian ‘I think, therefore I am’ can be further considered specifically in relation to language. Language determines the ‘I’ and the ‘I think’. This can be illustrated simply by reflecting on the idea that Descartes’s formulation was first published in Latin (‘cogito, ergo sum’). We anglophone subjects are already adrift in effects of language and translation, but so too was Descartes himself: after all, his works appeared not in some form of seventeenth-century French but in a foreign, ‘dead’ language. He was subject to the scholarly protocols of his own time and the requirement to write (and in some sense presumably think) in Latin. What is at stake in this logic of being subject to language is a conception of language as not simply instrumental: language is not simply something that we use. Language governs what we (can) say as much as we govern or uselanguage. Language is not simply an instrument: we are, unavoidably, agentsof language. Moreover we are, more precisely perhaps, secret or double agents of language: we do not necessarily know, from one134 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory moment to the next, howwe are being used by language or where it might be leading us. As in the most compelling kind of espionage story, however, this is not a situation we can get out of. As the narrator neatly puts it, in Margaret Atwood’s short story ‘Giving Birth’ (1977): ‘These are the only words I have, I’m stuck with them, stuck in them’ (225–6). The ‘in’ is, no doubt, more difficult to reflect on than the ‘with’, but it is no less important. How do these various questions and ideas relate to literary works more generally? First of all, let us emphasize that, if literature is concerned with exploring and reflecting on the nature of personal identity, it is also a space of exhilarating, even anarchic openness and imaginative or transformational
		- possibility. Literature can be thought of as being, in Derrida’s words, ‘the institution which allows one to say everything, in every way’ (Derrida 1992a, 36). In particular, there is this astonishing, anarchic freedom in literature: at least in principle, the author of a literary work can be any ‘I’ he or she wishes to. To put it like this is to imply that the author is an ‘I’ before or outside the literary work. But who is to say that there is an ‘I’ anywhere that is not in part literary? This rather strange question is a focus of one of the greatest comical literary or philosophical works in the twentieth century, Samuel Beckett’s The Unnamable(first published in English in 1959). This text is preoccupied with the idea that it is the ‘I’ itself that is in a sense the unnamable: the ‘I’ that speaks, or that seems to speak, is never true, never precisely itself, never the same, for example, as the ‘I’ who has spoken or the ‘I’ that writes ‘I’. The Unnamable, then, starts off from the apparently simple but perhaps unfathomable remark, ‘I, say I’, and from the paradox that ‘I seem to speak, it is not I, about me, it is not about me’ (293). Nearly 50 pages later the narrator is still impelled to observe that ‘on the subject of me properly so called...so far as I know I have received no information up to date’ (338). In Beckett’s wonderfully funny, but also dark and unnerving text, the Cartesian-rationalistic ‘I think’ becomes: ‘I only think, if that is the name for this vertiginous panic as of hornets smoked out of their nest, once a certain degree of terror has been exceeded’ (353). As with so much of Beckett’s writing, this sentence is at once quite straight- forward and semantically dense, unsettling, surprisingly resistant to a single interpretation. We might note, for example, the explicit attention to the uncer- tainties of language (‘if that is the name’) and of the relationship between terror and thinking. To think about this sentence can induce vertiginous panic and become terrifying. It succinctly illustrates literature’s complex and unsettling effects when it comes to thinking about thinking – when it comes to thinking about identity and about the ‘I’ that claims to think. We could conclude by trying to say a little more about the ways in which, as we suggested earlier, the ‘I’ or ‘me’ is in fact historically determined. One veryMe 135 broad but decisive example of this would be the question of the ‘I’ or ‘me’ in relation to romantic and post-romantic literature. In Of Grammatology (1967), Derrida argues that the importance of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s work consists in the fact that he ‘starts from a new model of presence: the subject’s self-presence within consciousnessor feeling’ (Derrida 1976, 98). European Romanticism in general might be characterized in terms of this kind of ‘new model of presence’, and in particular in terms of a new emphasis on the centrality and importance of the ‘I’ as a subject who both thinks and feels. This could be exemplified by a celebrated stanza written by George Gordon Byron on the back of a manuscript-page of canto 1 of Don Juan(1819–24): I would to heaven that I were so much clay, As I am blood, bone, marrow, passion, feeling – Because at least the past were pass’d away – And for the future – (but I write this reeling, Having got drunk exceedingly to-day, So that I seem to stand upon the ceiling) I say – the future is a serious matter –
		- And so – for God’s sake – hock and soda-water! The poet situates himself and the very act of writing in the comical immediacy of being drunk and feeling as if he is upside-down, standing on the ceiling. The new emphasis on the ‘I’ in romantic culture is consistently articulated in terms of the polarity or gulf between a subject (‘I feel’) and an object (the clouds, a skylark, a nightingale). The (impossible) desire for a fusion between subject and object (the idea for example of being, in Matthew Arnold’s words, ‘in harmony with nature’) is one of the most striking characteristics of the work of the English romantic poets. It is clear, for instance, in Keats’s ‘Ode to a Nightingale’, in which the speaker is eventually compelled to admit defeat in his attempt to fuse or dissolve into the nightingale’s song: the word ‘forlorn’ is ‘like a bell / To toll me back from thee to my sole self’. This emphasis on the ‘sole self’ broaches the notion of solipsism – that is to say the refusal or inabil- ity to believe in the reality of anything outside or beyond the self. The idea of such an isolation of the self has its representatives in classical philosophy and literature, but it is particularly pervasive in nineteenth- and twentieth-century European culture. It is evoked by the pathos, or bathos, of the opening lines of Matthew Arnold’s poem, ‘To Marguerite – Continued’ (1849): Yes! in the sea of life enisled, With echoing straits between us thrown,136 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory Dotting the shoreless watery wild, We mortal millions live alone. It is also implicit in the work of Freud, to the extent that psychoanalysis sug- gests that everything comes down to the power and significance of projection, of the qualities, moods or emotions which we project on topeople and things. Wallace Stevens sums this up when he says: few people realize on that occasion, which comes to all of us, when we look at the blue sky for the first time, that is to say: not merely see it, but look at it and experience it...– few people realize that they are looking at the world of their own thoughts and the world of their own feelings. (Stevens 1951, 65–6) But as we hope will by now be clear, solipsism is a myth, a delusion or mirage. Solipsism presupposes the idea of something like what Wittgenstein calls a private language (Wittgenstein 1984). There is no such thing as a private lan- guage: the phrase ‘private language’ is an oxymoron. Language is social or, at least, language comes from elsewhere, from others and from otherness in general. Even to say, as a self-avowed solipsist might, ‘I do not believe in the reality of anything apart from myself’, is to demonstrate a dependence on what is not ‘me’, not oneself. It is to demonstrate that one is subject tolanguage. As the voice, or one of the voices, in The Unnamableputs it: ‘I’m in words, made of words, others’ words...’ (390). Literature, like art more generally, has always been concerned with aspects of what can be called the unconscious or ‘not me’ or other: it is and has always been centrally concerned with dreams and fantasy, hallucinations and visions, madness, trance, and other kinds of impersonality or absences of self. But we could say that romantic and post-romantic literature has been increasingly sensitive to the role of otherness and increasingly aware of what might be described as our responsibilitiesin relation to otherness. Beckett’s writing is per- haps only the most philosophically
		- refined recent example of post-Romantic literature which is concerned to explore, deflate and transform our under- standing of the question, ‘Who do you think you are?’ In this respect his work might be seen to anticipate and encapsulate much of what is called poststruc- turalism. Poststructuralism demonstrates that the ‘I’ or human subject is neces- sarily decentred. It argues against the reductiveness (and even the possibility) of rationalism, in particular through its attention to what is other (though not simply ‘irrational’) as regards Western ‘rational’ thinking. And it persistently shows up the presumptuousness of the model of an autonomous, supposedlyMe 137 masterful human being, and thus points beyond ‘merely’ literary questions, exposing the barbarities of anthropocentrism in general. Some of this may be felt in a faltering, haunting few words from The Unnamable: if only I knew if I’ve lived, if I live, if I’ll live, that would simplify everything, impossible to find out, that’s where you’re buggered, I haven’t stirred, that’s all I know, no, I know something else, it’s not I, I always forget that, I resume, you must resume...

	- ### 16 Eco
	  collapsed:: true
		- 16. Eco Why in the world would we destroy the world in which we live, our own world, our only world? What drives that destruction? Why can’t we stop it? William Wordsworth’s ‘Nutting’ (1800) cannot answer these questions; perhaps no poem could. But this 54-line poem might help us to begin to think about them, and about questions of human-environmental interaction and ecological destruction and the ways in which literary study in recent years has started to be transformed by such concerns. In ‘Nutting’, the speaker recalls an occasion when, as a boy, he ‘sallied’ from his home to gather hazelnuts with ‘A nutting crook in hand’. He remembers ‘forcing’ his way through the uncultivated countryside, through woods and ‘pathless rocks’, until he comes to ‘one dear nook / Unvisited’. It is, he recalls, ‘A virgin scene’ and he stands there awhile, ‘Breathing with such suppression of the heart / As joy delights in’. This bower is, he thinks, a place where the seasons pass, year after year, ‘unseen by any human eye’. He sits down in the bower enjoying the murmuring of a brook, his heart ‘luxuriat[ing] with indifferent things’ (ll.3–39); but after a while he gets up: Then up I rose, And dragg’d to earth both branch and bough, with crash And merciless ravage, and the shady nook Of hazels, and the green and mossy bower, Deform’d and sullied, patiently gave up Their quiet being; and unless I now Confound my present feelings with the past, Even then, when from the bower I turn’d away, Exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings—Eco 139 I felt a sense of pain when I beheld The silent trees and the intruding sky.— (ll.41–51) The poem ends with what might appear to be a rather weak ‘moral’: we should adopt a ‘gentleness of heart’ in relation to nature, ‘for there is a Spirit in the woods’ (ll.53–4), the speaker declares. More powerful, alarming and provocative is the shock of this sudden, unmotivated and violent destruction. In Western literary and other culture, ‘nature’ is often fundamentally dis- tinguished from the human and, at the same time, gendered as female and even as maternal (as in the phrase ‘Mother Nature’). There certainly seem to be indications of femininity and motherhood in Wordsworth’s description of the womb-like bower before it is defiled: it is a (feminized) ‘virgin scene’ but it also features hazels hung with (maternal-sounding) ‘milk-white clusters’ (l.18). The poem has consequently been read from the perspective of psycho- analysis as an expression of a child’s rage (his rage and love, his rage because of his love, or need) for his mother, in terms of the desire to destroy what gives him physical, emotional, spiritual nurture. And it has been read in terms of sexual violence, as a kind of ‘rape’ of a feminized nature. It should also be said that, in keeping with the sexual suggestiveness of Wordsworth’s language, there is also a case for seeing the bowers and the hazels as phallic and virile: ‘not a broken bough / Droop’d with its wither’d leaves.../...but the hazels rose/ Tall and erect’ (ll.15–18). But these are not the only ways of reading Wordsworth’s poem. What is most striking about ‘Nutting’ is the way that the destruction of nature seems notto be motivated, the way that it is unexplained, seemingly inexplicable. So that we are left with the question with which we started: what drives us, or what drives Wordsworth’s speaker, to destroy the world? This, in a sense, is the core ecological question, perhaps finally the only question (along with the related question: how
		- do we prevent this destruction?). In recent years, there has been what amounts to an ‘ecological turn’ in thinking about literature, a turn that, as we shall argue, has the potential fundamentally to transform the way that we think about literature and about reading. Critics have begun to analyse ways in which literature engages with the destruction of nature, and with the relationship between humanity and the biosphere (of which, of course, humanity is ambiguously a part – both part of nature and not part of nature). In focusing on this interaction, ecocritical thinking complicates and adds to the more conventional idea that literature is concerned with questions of gender, race, class, economics, history, sexuality, and so on. It is for this reason that Timothy Clark calls ecocriticism ‘a provocative misfit amidst... literary and cultural debate’ (Clark, forthcoming). It may be the case that140 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory writers and critics, aswriters and critics, can do little or nothing to prevent or resolve problems of global warming, over-fishing, widespread pollution, the destruction on epic scale of animal and plant habitats, mass extinction of species along with human-engineered ecological disasters in all forms – to prevent what Martin Amis starkly sums up as the ‘toiletization of the planet’ (quoted in Deitering 1996, 196). Writers and critics are, however, well placed to analyse the ways in which this wasting of our world is not simply material or physical, but also rhetorical – the ways in which it is defined, conditioned and even, in certain respects, controlled by language itself. Rather than focusing on the question of the subjectivity of the speaker in Wordsworth’s poem and drawing on Oedipal models of development, an eco- inflected approach would register the larger contexts with which the speaker struggles in this poem. An ecocritical reading might notice, for example, the way in which Wordsworth’s poem seems to be structured around a series of oppositions: before/after; nature/human; wilderness/cultivation; and most explicitly, ‘virgin’ nature and its destruction and desecration by the boy. But it might also reckon with the way in which the destruction of the bower is in fact prefigured in the description of nature before the attack: in a sense, nature has already been desecrated, even in its representation as wilderness. Nature is always already contaminated by the human and by language. Death, after all, is present in the opening lines: ‘It seems a day’, the poem begins, ‘One of those heavenly days which cannot die / When forth I sallied from our cottage-door’ (ll.1–3). It seemsthat it cannot die, yet it is already in the past tense (‘I sallied’): thus there is already an intimation of mortality hanging over the day in ques- tion. It is indeed as if in Wordsworth’s ‘sallied’, ‘sullied’ might also be heard, so sallying forth would already be a sullying. And, after all, there is something slightly nutty about ‘Nutting’. The boy himself seems a little crazed. (Later in life Wordsworth declared of the poem ‘I was an impassioned nutter’ (Wordsworth 1992, 391).) The speaker describes his younger self as being ‘Trick’d out in proud disguise of Beggar’s weeds’ (l.7), as if his whole bearing and ‘Motley’ appearance (l.10) is a kind of ‘trick’. It is as if his clothes are the socially and culturally constituted other of fruitful, productive, desirable nature, as if they are ‘weeds’; and as if humanity is as a beggar to nature. These and other traces of deception, violence, cruelty, insanity, jesting, clowning and impoverishment are strangely at work within Wordsworth’s pastoral opening, his apparently ‘innocent’ description of a country walk. So
		- that rather than a strict opposition between a boy’s harmony with nature and his despoliation of it, the language of the poem (also) presents us with the idea that that relation- ship is always mediated, compromised, violent. It leads us to reflect, indeed, on the idea that, as Jacques Derrida puts it, ‘there is no natural violence,Eco 141 an earthquake is not violent, it is only violent insofar as it damages human interests’ (Derrida and Ferraris 2001, 92). Violence has to do with the human, starting with the violence of language itself, in its representations and appro- priations of ‘nature’. Despite the ‘ism’ in its name, ecocriticism is not in fact constituted as yet another ‘ism’: it does not offer a distinctive methodology of reading, but draws on feminist or Marxist or historical or postcolonial or psychoanalytic or deconstructive approaches, in order to attend to a world of environmental questions. The term ‘ecocriticism’ is perhaps useful as a means of referring to a relatively new dimension and emphasis in literary studies and beyond, but in many respects it makes no sense. It is not a matter of choosing to be or not to be an ecocritic. We are all eco-critters, so to speak, some less responsible and thoughtful than others. Ecocritical thinking in this respect involves a change of scale and vision: rather than an obsession with human-sized objects, it attends both to the miniature realm of a blade of grass, an ant, amoeba, or pathogen, and to the mega-scale of the ocean, the mountain, or even the earth itself (as well as everything in between). An ecocritical reading might foreground those strange lines towards the end of Wordsworth’s poem about the boy ‘Exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings’ while also feeling ‘a sense of pain’ when he sees what he has done; and it might consider the lines as a reflection on the way that both public and private wealth are dependent on the exploitation and ultimately the destruction of nature. From this perspective, the poem would seem to encapsulate a pattern that the environmental sociologist Franz Broswimmer analyses in his compelling study of the destructive effects of human communities throughout history, Ecocide: A Short History of Mass Extinction of Species(2002), in which successful societies accumulate wealth through ecological destruction to the point at which their very existence is undermined as a result of that wasting of the environment, in an eco- unfriendly cycle of boom-and-bust. The pattern of destruction that Broswimmer describes has, of course, accelerated in the 200 years since Wordsworth was writing. While early societies produced their own localized form of unintended ‘ecocide’ and their own subsequent demise (Broswimmer examines the cases of temporarily ‘successful’ societies such as the Mesopotamians, the Romans, the Mayans, and others), twenty-first century global capitalism is currently facing the possibility that within the lifetime of many of us living today, our rapacious, land-grabbing, polluting rage for road- and air-travel, consumables and other material possessions will lead inexorably, unstoppably to the effective destruc- tion of more or less all life on the planet. Such a future is imagined in Cormac McCarthy’s Pulitzer-Prize winning novel The Road(2006), a book that has142 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory been hailed by the British journalist and environmental activist George Monbiot as ‘the most important environmental book ever written’, one that will ‘change the way you see the world’ (Monbiot 2007). Since for some people, such praise might make the novel sound like a worthy but dull attack on global capitalism, we would like to affirm that The Roadis also a compelling narrative written
		- in brilliant but restrained, almost biblical prose, and that, despite its bleak attenuations of verbal texture, it presents a richly moving and highly readable narrative of a post-apocalyptic future. For Monbiot, the importance of McCarthy’s novel lies in its vivid imagining of the devastating reality of life for a few survivors after an apocalyptic event which has left the world dimmed, grey with floating ash, and in which almost all animal and plant life is dead. Nights in this world are ‘beyond darkness’, while days are ‘more grey each one than what had gone before’ (1). McCarthy imagines a desperate, barren end for a world in which language itself is dying out: The world shrinking down about a raw core of parsible entities. The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. Colors. The names of birds. Things to eat. More fragile than he would have thought. How much of it was gone already? The sacred idiom shorn of its referents and so of its reality. Drawing down like something trying to preserve heat. In time to wink out forever. (93) There are scattered, mostly murderous human survivors, but the only other living animal and plant life encountered are a few mushrooms, at one point, which are quickly eaten, and at another point the distant bark of a dog – which, if its ominous silencing is anything to go by, also quickly becomes someone’s dinner. The narrative concerns an unnamed man and his young son who are travelling south through a devastated America in search of the ocean and life-saving warmth – and the possibility, the tenuous and almost entirely unwarranted hope, of some community with which to settle, of some possible future. The pair walk slowly through a scorched and blackened landscape almost entirely denuded of life, scavenging for sustenance amongst the detri- tus left after an apocalyptic event several years earlier (a nuclear war? an impact with a large asteroid? – the text does not disclose). Since the catastrophe and the almost complete destruction of animal and plant life, survival has depended on scavenging for residual products of lost modernity such as canned food. But such products have become more and more scarce and the savagery with which the few survivors treat each other has consequently become more extreme: everyone is now starving and other people are there- fore seen as rivals for food or even asfood. The most shocking scenes in thisEco 143 often harrowing novel involve cannibalism: the man opens a locked cellar to see a group of prisoners whose limbs are to be harvested for their captors’ nourishment even while they are still alive; later, the man and the boy come across a fire, recently abandoned in panic, over which is the blackened, gutted torso of a baby on a spit. In this new world, order, morality, humanity itself has almost entirely broken down and remains only in the father’s love for his son, his determination to protect him, and in the refusal of the man and the boy to exploit others to save themselves. The importance of McCarthy’s novel lies in its bleak, almost affectless world of its prose, and its starkly con- ceived, terrifying vision of a post-apocalyptic future, with its warning against our current profligate existence. Wordsworth’s poem and McCarthy’s novel might help us to think about the kinds of ideas, and the ways of reading, that ecocritical thinking opens up. The following might be considered as some of the most important terms whereby literature can be reconceived and literary texts reread: Externality ‘Externality’ is the idea that there is an
		- environment elsewhere, outside of our immediate habitat available for exploitation – another village, town or region, another country or, best of all, another continent or even another planet. The concept of externality links with questions of colonialism and postcolonialism in particular since this ‘elsewhere’ is typically a colony whose natural resources can be exploited for the economic benefit of the colonisers regardless of the effect on the indigenous population (whether human or not). It is everything that is at issue in the idea of the exotic. But a properly eco- logical thinking figures externality as a dangerous myth, bringing us up against the fact that there is only one world, in which everything is connected to every- thing else. It has been estimated that for all of the six billion people now alive to have a standard of living equivalent to that of the average American citizen there would need to be two or three extra Earth-sized planets. But there are no such planets, and the idea that we could colonize, say, the atmosphere-thin wastes of the moon or the arctic desert of Mars seems little more than a consoling but dangerous fantasy (like ideas of heaven or any other after-life Nirvana in which the failings of this life are imagined to be magically redeemed in another, alternative ‘world’): outside of science-fiction or the wilder specu- lations of scientists, there is effectively no other space, no externality, apart from the Earth, no other world but this one. Externality in Wordsworth’s poem is the compromised, sullied wilderness into which the boy sallies. In McCarthy’s novel, there is a sense in which the external, the other of American144 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory global colonialism, has become internal, a sense that this externality has finally been destroyed, that there is finally no elsewhere, no place to go that is not already a devastated, alien, dead, waste land. Ethics of the future While ecology is concerned with the suffering of millions of people on the planet today whose lives are compromised or indeed wasted by environmental destruction and mismanagement, it is also necessarily future-oriented. Ecocriticism therefore demands a rethinking of ethics, extending the notion of our responsibility for others unpredictably into the future, since those others include people yet to be born, as well as those who will live after our death. While the consequences of our communal addiction to road use and to cheap foreign holidays may not seem to involve significant human suffer- ing, ecological thinking would stress that your cheap flight to a destination of sunshine and inexpensive booze is directly correlated to the unknown suffering of future generations. McCarthy’s The Road is concerned with a man’s commitment to preserving the life of his son, and in this sense with the father’s sense of responsibility for future generations. At the same time, this dystopian novel has to do with a thinking of an unbearable future – and the lackof a future – that we may be preparing for generations to come (or those generations that might in consequence notcome) thanks to the choices that we make today. Nature Raymond Williams, one of the first modern ecocritical thinkers, famously refers to ‘nature’ as ‘perhaps the most complex word in the language’ (Williams 1983, 219). Nature has itself come under renewed attention, has been rethought and redefined, in recent ecocritical writing. One of the key questions regarding ‘nature’ concerns its relationship with the human. Is ‘nature’ that which is outside of, other to, the human, as is suggested by certain forms of religion, for example those that deny the naturalism
		- of Darwinian evolution? Or are humans part ofnature, as is suggested by Darwinism and more generally by the Western scientific paradigm? While ecocritical thinking would tend to align itself with the ‘scientific’ paradigm, with the idea of the human as animal, it also pays attention to ways in which this ambiguity or uncertainty operates in literary texts and in cultural production more generally. Wordsworth’s presentation of nature in ‘Nutting’ is, as we have seen, ambiguous: ‘nature’ is where the boy is not; but for the poet to registerEco 145 nature he must have experienced it, nature must be humanized (and in being humanized it is contaminated, destroyed). In a sense, there is no such thing as nature, no such thing as the unmediated, unsullied, non-human nature that Wordsworth’s poem might seem to suggest. ‘There is no nature’, Alan Liu has famously remarked in a monumental tome on Wordsworth and history, ‘except as it is constituted by acts of political definition’ (Liu 1989, 104). Environmental criticism ‘Environmental criticism’ is the term that one of its leading proponents, Laurence Buell, uses to describe a certain engagement with ‘nature writing’. Environmental criticism can be distinguished from what has come to be called ecocriticism in that a critic like Buell is primarily concerned with the kind of writing that has as its focus the environment and its relationship with humanity – so-called ‘nature writing’ – while ecocriticism is also concerned with teasing out the ecological questions, implications and challenges of any writing, whether or not that writing might involve a conscious and explicit engagement with nature. For ecocriticism, Jane Austen’s studies of upper- middle class manners and customs in a novel like Pride and Prejudice(1813) are as valid a source of ecological speculation and analysis as Henry David Thoreau’s philosophical musings on his pond in Walden: Or, Life in the Woods (1854). For the ecocritic, the famous sentence that opens Austen’s novel (‘It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife’) is profoundly ecological: ‘univer- sally’ raises the question of which ‘universe’ we are speaking of and of whether in fact this very restrictive Anglo- or at least Euro-centric late eighteenth- or early-nineteenth century social formation can be exported to other parts of the world and to other times; a ‘good fortune’ is necessarily premised on ecological exploitation (whether in the form of private ownership of land, the privatization of the commons in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century enclosures movement, the slavery-based economy of Caribbean plantations, or the newly industrialized exploitation of mineral and other resources); and the fact that marriage is premised on reproduction, on the propagation of the species, means that it is necessarily linked to the questions of population and overpopulation that, in his controversial book An Essay on the Principle of Population(1798), Thomas Malthus was beginning to bring to the attention of the English-speaking world at about the time that Austen was writing. An ecocritical reading of the first sentence of Austen’s novel would be alert to all of these and other ‘environmental’ factors in her famous novel; it would reread the novel, indeed, according to the terms dictated by such questions, just as146 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory much as it would focus on the more obviously ‘ecological’ questions raised by Wordsworth’s poem or McCarthy’s novel. Deep ecology Deep ecology is an environmental movement that rejects the notion of ‘sus- tainable development’ and suggests that capitalism, progress, even Western liberalism itself is responsible for the current ecological crisis that afflicts the world. Deep ecology
		- might be compared to the literary and philosophical work of deconstruction in its call for a radical critique and transformation of conventional ways of conceiving of ‘human’ values, of humanism, even of science itself. For deep ecologists, it is a matter of new ways of thinking about our relationship with the world, a new ethics and politics that will challenge the instrumentalist view that the world is and should be available for human exploitation. Both Wordsworth’s poem and McCarthy’s novel allow for the possibility of a rethinking of the relationship between humans and the bio- sphere: it would be possible to read Wordsworth’s poem as a radical critique of the colonizing tendency of humans; McCarthy’s novel is, among other things, a polemic that calls for a fundamental revaluation of environmental ethics and of the way we live now. Ecofeminism As we have suggested in relation to Wordsworth’s poem, ecofeminism attends in particular to the figurative language in which women and nature are presented and it responds to ways in which nature and the feminine are often linked in a gesture that denigrates both. In a landmark essay from 1984, for example, Annette Kolodny comments on ‘how bound we still are by the vocabulary of a feminine landscape and the psychological patterns of regres- sion and violation that it implies’ (Kolodny 1996, 176). Thus, ecofeminist critics such as Kolodny, Louise Westling, Patrick Murphy, Greta Gaard, Donna Haraway and others have highlighted and questioned the gendering of ‘nature’ in literary and other discourse. From this perspective, patriarchy is itself understood to be responsible for the exploitation of both nature and women. Such exploitation is produced partly by way of an identification of one with the other (women are said to be less rational than men, thus ‘closer to nature’, and therefore in need of civilizing, through masculine control and order). Non- or anti-patriarchal thinking, according to this analysis, would allow for a relationship with the ecosystem that is not exploitative and would demand, indeed, an ethics and politics that is no longer driven by patriarchalEco 147 codes of bourgeois individualism and what Marx calls ‘primitive accumula- tion’, by colonization, the violent and rapacious drive for mastery, and, neces- sarily, ecological destruction. Gender, like nature itself, is written into The Roadjust by the fact that there are virtually no female characters in the novel: it’s a man’s world, as the chilling saying goes. Nature – in the sense of living things – has been almost completely destroyed, and there are almost no women in this new, brutally savage world. But in the novel’s denoucment the boy finds a family – a substitute father andmother – in a scene which at least offers the hope of new life, of women and of nature. Anthropomorphic, anthropocentric To borrow a distinction that Don Scheese makes, ecocritical thinking is eco- rather than ego-centred (Scheese 1996, 307). As such, it draws our atten- tion to the multiple ways in which literary texts figure the non-human as human – to anthropomorphism – in what is often a sentimental appropriation of the non-human for human ends. Anthropomorphism includes the casual use of what John Ruskin calls the ‘affective fallacy’ (Modern Painters(1860) Part 4, Chapter 12). For example, the lightning that strikes the old oak tree in Chapter 23 of Jane Eyre somehow articulates the double threat and temptation that Rochester’s proposal of marriage represents to Jane; the storm in Chapter 83 of Middlemarch similarly reflects the ‘stormy’ passions of Dorothea and Will Ladislaw; and so on. The ruses and delusions of anthro- pomorphism are also at work in the celebration
		- of natural sublimity in a poem like Percy Bysshe Shelley’s ‘Mont Blanc’ (1816), in which the mountain is figured as (or as resembling) ‘My own, my human mind’ (l.37), as well as in the famous presentation of Egdon Heath as one of the main ‘characters’, even the protagonist, of Thomas Hardy’s The Return of the Native (1878). Anthropomorphism also concerns the way in which animals are regularly treated as having human motivations, emotions, language, consciousness, even morality – from countless examples of fables, children’s literature and fairy tales to more subtle anthropomorphisms such as the whale in Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), bees in some of Sylvia Plath’s Ariel poems (1965), ants in Derek Walcott’s ‘The Bounty’ (1997), or the crow in Philip Roth’s The Human Stain (2000) that is presented as part of an attack on late-twentieth century conceptions of the ‘human’. Ecocritical thinking ana- lyzes the ways in which such figurations of the apparently non-human lead inexorably to anthropocentrism, to the configuration of the world in human terms – which in turn leads to the exploitation of the non-human (however that category is defined) for human benefit. The world is conceived of as148 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory human-centred and therefore endlessly available as a resource for human comfort, wealth and well-being. The ecologist Michael Robins offers a striking suggestion for rethinking anthropocentrism when he comments on human armpits (yours as well as ours, we fear): ‘From the biosphere’s perspective, the whole point of Homo sapiens is their armpits, aswarm with 24.1 billion bacteria’ (quoted in Campbell 1996, 133). So where does this leave us (apart from worrying about our underarms and deodorants)? As well as praising The Road, George Monbiot has expressed his enthusiasm for the first Hollywood global-warming disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow(2004), declaring it a ‘great movie’ and, despite its ‘lousy science’, ‘one of the best movies ever released’ (Monbiot 2004). But we think that Monbiot should get out more (at least to the movies). In our judgment, The Day After Tomorrowstinks. The science is not just lousy, it’s preposter- ous, matched only by the blockbuster’s toxic combination of melodrama and sentimentality (served up in alternating chunks at regular 10-minute inter- vals), by its frankly cruddy special effects, characterization and dialogue, and by the absurdity of its plot. We can hardly bring ourselves to sketch the story: a maverick climatologist, having personally briefed the US President in Washington on the coming global disaster and advised evacuation of the population of the southern US states to Mexico – it is too late to save the inhab- itants of the northern states; the population of Canada doesn’t get a look in – nevertheless sets out, amidst the mother of all snap ice-ages, to drive and then walk to New York in order to save his son, who is sheltering in the famous public library with a handful of other refugees. (All those who foolishly left the library have perished in the −150°C freeze along with most other New Yorkers.) The Day After Tomorrow shares with The Road a cataclysmic scenario and a recuperative father–son narrative, and despite the radical nature of McCarthy’s dystopian novel, its truly inventive evocation of a post- apocalyptic world, an ecocritical reading might finally see both novel and movie as embedded in a troubling anthropocentrism that undermines the ability of either to fully confront ecological questions. In both, father and son encapsulate the liberal-humanist idea that individual human life (rather than populations, rather than the biosphere or ecosystem) is the ultimate and finally the only value. Both are characterized by the
		- familiar Hollywood eth- ical calculus (the basis of all‘disaster movies’, indeed) which asserts that the survival of a single unique individual allows redemptive closure (and a happy ending) regardless of how many others get wiped out along the way. And both affirm the values of the so-called ‘nuclear’ family: at the end of McCarthy’s novel, although the father dies, the boy finds another family with whom heEco 149 might survive and even thrive; the movie ends with the father finding and rescuing his son, and with the son’s romantic attachment to the attractive young woman with whom he has shared his life-threatening library experi- ence. Life goes on, at least for these few people, for these individual families. So while we share Monbiot’s enthusiasm for narratives that might indeed shake up people’s indifference to environmental degradation and disaster, we would stress that ecocritical readings of such texts should be alert to the complexities both of their environmental contexts and their linguistic and indissociably linked aesthetic values. To put it simply, the failures of The Day After Tomorrowas a movie are bound up with its failures of ecological analysis; and the weaknesses of The Road, such as they are, have to do with a certain redemptive sentiment that recoils at the full implications of its own radical vision of an ecologically bereft future. It is increasingly possible, and indeed urgent and necessary, therefore, to develop forceful and compelling ecocritical readings across the entire range of literary and other writings, readings that go beyond the business-as-usual anthropocentrism of conventional liberal humanism, and that take as their focus the ecosystem itself – that place, that home (eco- is from Greek oikos, house, dwelling) in which we have no choice but to live and, like other animals, die. Further reading Two essential and reasonably accessible texts to start with are Greg Garrard’s lucid and intelligent introduction to the field, Ecocriticism (2004), and Laurence Coupe’s valuable collection of fairly brief extracts from influential essays from the Romantic period to the present, The Green Studies Reader (2000). In writing this chapter we have been helped by seeing a draft of Timothy Clark’s excellent Cambridge Introduction to Literature and the Environment(forthcoming), which we recommend as a readable and highly informative primer. Raymond Williams’s The Country and the City(1973) is an important and influential precursor of ecocriticism, and Jonathan Bate’s’ Romantic Ecology(1991) is another influential early intervention in the field, mainly focused on Wordsworth (see also Bate’s more recent and wider- ranging The Song of the Earth(2000)). Much more demanding is Timothy Morton’s Ecology Without Nature(2007), a sophisticated study which, like Clark’s book, stresses the importance of engaging ecocriticism with decon- structive literary and cultural theory. There is some interesting recent work on ecology and early-modern literature, including Mary Floyd-Wilson and Garrett A. Sullivan, Jr, Environment and Embodiment in Early Modern England (2007), Gabriel Egan, Green Shakespeare (2006), and Robert N.150 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory Watson, Back to Nature(2006). Three useful collections of essays that also offer helpful introductions are Glotefelty and Fromm, ed., The Ecocriticism Reader(1996), Armbruster and Wallace, eds, Beyond Nature Writing(2001), and Kerridge and Sammells, eds, Writing the Environment (1998). The journal Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and the Environment(ISLE) publishes essays on ecocriticism and topics around literary ecology (see www.unr.edu/cla/engl/isle/)
	- ### 17 Animals
	  collapsed:: true
		- 17. Animals Here are four animals: 1. His small Umbrella quaintly halved Describing in the Air An Arc alike inscrutable Elate Philosopher. 2. This animal which, like a ship’s anchor, first casts off in the void, In order to – even upside down – maintain itself there suddenly 3. Spacefarers past living planetfall on our ever-dive in bloom crystal: when about our self kin selves appear, slowing, rubber to pulp, we slack from spear... 4. Queer, with your thin wings and streaming legs, How you sail like a heron, or a dull clot of air, A nothingness. All of these poems concern animals, whether mammal, insect or fish. Some of them may be easier to identify than others. The first is a bat, by Emily Dickinson; the second a spider, by Francis Ponge; the third, cuttlefish, by Les152 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory Murray; and last but not least, a mosquito, by D.H. Lawrence. Everything we hope to explore here, apropos the question of animals and literature, might be illustrated on the basis of these four brief extracts. We say ‘literature’ but we need in fact to be wary: all of these examples are poems. Indeed there is, we want to suggest, something special about the relationship between poetry and animals, something that takes us, perhaps, to the very heart of what we mean by terms such as the ‘poetic’, ‘poetic language’ and even ‘poem’. And this can in turn, we will argue, illuminate in a more general way what we call literature. This might sound like a merely aesthetic exercise confined to looking at how a few poets write about little creatures, furry or otherwise, but our topic is of course far larger. The world is currently challenged, not only by terrible poverty, injustice and inequality, and by environmental degradation and cli- mate change, but also by the widespread and massive destruction of so-called ‘wildlife’ habitats, the rapid disappearance of countless different animal species and the threat of many more extinctions to come. These challenges are all interrelated in different and highly complex ways, but at their core is the violence of what is called anthropocentrism. Anthropocentrism has to do with how humans think and act as if ‘man’ (in Heidegger’s phrase) were ‘the lord of the earth’, going around ‘everywhere and always encounter[ing] only himself’ (Heidegger 1977, 27). As we try to argue elsewhere in this book (in ‘Me’, ‘Laughter’ and ‘Eco’, in particular), the human is not at the centre of the world, however much we might imagine or behave otherwise. In many ways, no doubt, the implications and consequences of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species(1859) and The Descent of Man(1871) are still sinking in. So too, perhaps, is the gender-biased presumptuousness of referring to human- ity as ‘man’. The crisis here is obviously not just one of language and naming – though that, as we shall see, is perhaps more significant than might be supposed. Nor is it only of concern to those who regard themselves as ‘green’ or ‘feminist’. Like the question of environmentalism that we discuss in ‘Eco’, the question of animals and animality watches over us all, every moment. The latter indeed may be still watching, literally, after the end of humanity. In calling this chapter ‘Animals’ and opening with a few brief examples of poems about animals, we have perhaps already managed to give the impres- sion that there are animals (bats, spiders, cuttlefish and mosquitoes) on the one hand, and humans (poets) on the other. Humans areanimals, after all: an ‘animal’ is fundamentally simply ‘a living creature’ (OED,
		- sense 1a), a word deriving from the Latin anima, ‘breath’. So what happens when humans write about other animals? We know that Dickinson’s poem is about a bat because it opens with the words, ‘The Bat is dun, with wrinkled Wings –’ (Poem 1575).Animals 153 But the four-line stanza we have quoted is in fact extraordinarily difficult to pin down, on account of its imaginative and syntactic complexity. The verse in question seems to evoke the bat’s wings and the movement they trace in the air. The lines appear to constitute a sentence, but there is no main verb. We are compelled to take the present participle ‘describing’ as the main verb, but we are still left with the conundrum of ‘alike’ and the strangeness of ‘elate’ as an adjective (meaning lifted, raised, exalted, inspired). The four-line sentence notably lacks all punctuation: it is as if the words and phrases themselves were batting about, this way and that, unpredictable and, indeed, like an animal, inscrutable. A provoking rapport emerges here between the poem and the bat. You cannot pin down the lines anymore than you could the creature described. It is perhaps no coincidence that in a famous essay in which he tries to pin down consciousness, the philosopher Thomas Nagel should choose to reflect on the question of what it is like to be a bat (Nagel 1974). Inscrutability is a feature of these lines of poetry as it is of the line or lines of the ‘Arc’ that ‘the Bat’ itself describes. For Dickinson’s bat, after all, is himself a sort of poet or writer: ‘Describing in the Air / An Arc alike inscrutable / Elate Philosopher.’ Dickinson’s poem has a strikingly self-reflexive dimension: it can be read, among other things, as a poem about the poetic, about writing, and more par- ticularly about writing (itself) as act or event, doing or making. (We might helpfully recall here the etymology of ‘poetry’, from the ancient Greek poiein, to do or make.) The lines from Ponge’s poem ‘The New Spider’ are up to something similar: the very syntax, slipping and interconnectedness of the lines seems to cast forth the impression of a spider weaving: ‘In order to – even upside down – maintain / itself there suddenly’. (Another etymology comes to mind here: the word ‘text’ derives from the Latin textere, to weave.) Likewise, Murray’s strangely beautiful, ghostlike poem ‘Cuttlefish’ concludes with an image of writing in the ink of cuttlefish culture: ‘leaving, of our culture, an ecto- plasm of ink’. (Murray is here alluding to ‘sepia’, another name for cuttlefish. The sepia of sepia photography and water-colour paint is indeed, literally, a product of cuttlefish. The earliest photographs were writings not just in light but in cuttlefish ink.) Lawrence’s ‘The Mosquito’ is in some ways the most surreptitious in its self-reflexivity. It differs from the other poems discussed here in that it addresses the animal itself. It is characterized by a sort of bantering, question- ing, conversational tone, opening with the words: ‘When did you start your tricks, / Monsieur?’ Everyone knows that mosquitoes are not French: the poem’s opening address is at once comical and indicative of the tricksiness of Lawrence’s language. Likewise the ‘clot’: ‘dull clot of air’ is marvellously suggestive of the almost imperceptible, ghostly character of the creature154 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory addressed. At the same time it evokes the image of a blood-clot. ‘Clot’, in other words, is self-reflexive, a subtle projection on tothis blood-sucking creature of precisely what, later in the poem, it doesto the speaker. It sucks ‘live
		- blood, / My blood’, the poet reports. It becomes a ‘winged blood-drop’. Already, from the beginning, the play in the sounds of ‘monsieur’ and ‘mosquito’ intimates that this is a poem working explicitly at the level of the signifier, with the arbitrariness of language. ‘Monsieur’ has no more natural or logical a relation to the creature in question than does ‘mosquito’ itself. Lawrence’s poem is a wonderfully funny account of the sort of enraged anthropomorphic telepathy a mosquito can indeed inspire: ‘I hate the way you lurch off sideways into air / Having read my thoughts against you’. The poem, it transpires, is about the poet becoming a mosquito in turn: ‘Am I not mosquito enough to out- mosquito you?’ And it concludes, perhaps not entirely surprisingly, with the death of the addressee, the mosquito squished: ‘Queer, what a dim dark smudge you have disappeared into!’ In a sense, then, each poem is not only aboutan animal, but also aspires to be a sort of animal. Each would bean ‘animal poem’. In a certain imaginative register (as if), the poem inscribes itself in the world of the creature described. It wouldbe a true ‘animal poem’: it would like to be, but of course it cannot. It would like to be telepathic, it would like not only to communicate with but to speak on behalf of the animal, as an animal, from the animal’s point of view. But this would be a kind of anthropomorphism, in other words a fantasy or projection. In truth, what all of the poems sharply convey is a sense of the impossibilityof finding the right words, of adequately describing, of putting in language what a specific animal is like, what is entailed in an encounter with this particular creature (bat, spider, cuttlefish, mosquito). For how on earth do you, should you describe a non-human animal? How can you say what it is like to be one? The English language is stuffed (as a taxidermist might say) with figurative references to animals. Just spinning off a few examples can make us sound faintly poetic: quiet as a mouse, sweating like a pig, slow as a tortoise, a bear hug, a dog’s breakfast, sick as a parrot, crow’s feet, pigeon-toed, the elephant in the room, rabbit in headlights, dead as a dodo, going the whole hog, can of worms, dark horse, lion’s share, crocodile tears, snake in the grass, wolf in sheep’s clothing, sly as a fox, happy as a clam, bullish, lousy, waspish, hare-brained, headless chicken, water off a duck’s back, eyes like a hawk, frog in your throat, you can lead a horse to water, whale of a time, loan sharks, lying toad, swansong, running around like a blue-arsed fly, being badgered, beaver- ing away, bee in your bonnet, cat got your tongue, completely batty...The list is as long as the queue for Noah’s ark. We are forever comparing ourselves to other animals. These idioms seem to affirm the implicit violence of ourAnimals 155 relations with other animals: many of the examples just given involve a negative figuration of the animal and all seem to involve a kind of easy anthro- pomorphism. But in the very gesture of such appropriation these idioms also register the othernessof these creatures. It is striking, for example, that when Lawrence is trying to describe a mosquito, he resorts to a simile involving another animal(‘like a heron’), then to a kind of oxymoron (‘clot of air’), and finally to a blank absence of all image or resemblance (‘A nothingness’). Correspondingly, Ponge turns to a nautical metaphor to evoke the spider as
		- it casts off ‘like a ship’s anchor’ into the air. In the case of the lines from Dickinson and Murray, the explicit marker of figurative language, the ‘like’ (or ‘as’), is tacit or omitted: the bat’s wings are (like) a ‘small Umbrella quaintly halved’, the bat is (like) a ‘philosopher’; the cuttlefish are (like) ‘spacefarers’, their bodies are (like) ‘rubber’, ‘pulp’ and ‘spear’. The elision of such markers, however, merely accentuates the extra- vagance or fancifulness of the descriptions. Dickinson’s language is anthropo- morphic, but in a quirky, defamiliarizing way. The figuration of the bat as a sort of neat and pleasant gentleman (‘His small Umbrella quaintly halved’) entails unsettling undersides. Murray’s poem on the other hand crucially depends on its title. Without the word ‘Cuttlefish’ at the top of the page we could hardly be expected to surmise who or what is the subject of the fantastical, science- fictional phrases: ‘Spacefarers past living planetfall / on our ever-dive in bloom crystal’. (‘Planetfall’, as the OED informs us, is originally a mid-twentieth- century word for ‘A landing on a planet after a journey through space’.) We are so immersed in a language of strange compounds and juxtapositions (‘ever- dive’, ‘bloom crystal’), in a fluid syntax that seems to let odd phrases float by (‘past living’, ‘in bloom’) while unsettling any easy identification of parts of speech (is ‘bloom’ an adjective, ‘pulp’ a verb, ‘spear’ a noun?), that we may not even notice on first reading that these are rhyming couplets. These opening lines are rendered even more bizarre, perhaps, by the poet’s anthropomorphic strategy of speaking in a cuttlefish royal we (‘our ever-dive’, ‘our self’, ‘we slack’). Perplexed (but also delighted) we may well find ourselves asking: ‘we’? what is this? what is this poem or poet like? The most powerful poems about animals are those that disorient us, leave the reader stranded, up in the air, underground or underwater, breathtaken. Murray’s ‘Cuttlefish’ appears in a volume that is suggestively entitled Translations from the Natural World: all animal poems are ‘translations’, we might say, but without access to an original. In a sense they are all works of science fiction or strangely ‘elate’ philosophy. There is a growing body of critical and theoretical work (sometimes referred to as ‘animal studies’) concerned with ‘the question of the animal’ as156 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory the basis for what Matthew Calarco, in his book Zoographies, has called ‘new social movements that are seeking to develop a postliberal, posthumanist approach to politics’ (Calarco 2008, 6). Debate concerning ‘the question of the animal’ is, so to speak, a real hornet’s nest. Do animals have rights, as Peter Singer (1990) and Tom Regan (1983), among others, have argued? Don’t lots of species of animal exhibit characteristics that are often said to define the human, such as use of tools, language, altruism, play, inventiveness, suf- fering, mourning and so on? Is it true, as Aristotle suggested, that ‘no animal laughs save Man’ (Aristotle 2001, 69)? Is it the case that animals don’t die but merely ‘perish’, as Heidegger suggested (see Heidegger 1962, 291; Heidegger 2001, 176)? Or, conversely, should we not suppose that, as Gilles Deleuze puts it, ‘contrary to the spiritualist prejudice, it is the animal who knows how to die, who has a sense or premonition of death’ (Deleuze 1998, 2)? Should we feel OK about eating other animals? Can battery-farming be justified? What about some of the other barbaric ways in which non- human animals are treated and killed? What gives us the right to make these decisions? Calarco himself is
		- one of many who argue emphatically that ‘the human-animal distinction can no longer and ought no longer to be maintained’ (3). There are, however, good reasons for being cautious about such an asser- tion. A woman is not a spider (despite her appearance in Marvel Comics), any more than a man is a bat (despite numerous impersonations, from Bram Stoker to Christian Bale’s ‘dark knight’). Questioning and indeed seeking to dismantle or deconstruct anthropocentrism, in philosophy as in everyday life, is one thing; but dropping or claiming to drop distinctions altogether is something else. Rather than blurring the line between ‘animal’ and ‘human’ we should attend to differences. In his remarkable work The Animal That Therefore I Am, Jacques Derrida explores the idea that, perhaps more effectively than any- thing else in the world, the ‘question of the animal’ prompts us to think about ‘the wholly other’ (Derrida 2008, 11). In a startling moment the eminent French philosopher recalls being naked in the bathroom with his cat. (We say ‘his cat’ in order to simplify matters. In fact, like every cat-lover, Derrida knows that no one can truly own a cat because, as he says, ‘A pussycat never belongs’ [7].) He is talking about that ‘strange moment’ when, ‘before even wanting it or knowing it myself, I am passively presented to it as naked, I am seen and seen naked, before even seeing myselfseen by a cat’, seen by that ‘wholly other they call “animal”, for example “cat”’ (11). Entirely at odds with any sentimental or anthropomorphic appropriation of the cat, Derrida, naked before it, summarizes: ‘Thinking perhaps begins there’ (29). In this way Derrida seeks to elaborate on the notion that every living creature constitutes what he calls an ‘unsubstitutable singularity’ (9). It is a question of thiscat, inAnimals 157 Derrida’s bathroom, not just any old cat. Indeed, in his terms, there is no such thing as ‘any old cat’. Every cat is other, and every other is wholly other. This sense of the unsubstitutable singularity of any and every animal, he contends, is especially evident in poetry. And this is one of the ways of distinguishing poetry from philosophy. As Derrida puts it: ‘thinking concerning the animal, if there is such a thing, derives from poetry....[This] is what philosophy has, essentially, had to deprive itself of’ (7). Walt Whitman writes, in ‘Song of Myself’: ‘I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain’d, / I stand and look at them long and long’ (‘Song of Myself’, section 32). But these lines tell only half the story: it is also and perhaps more significantly a question about what happens when the animal looks back, or just looks, at us, in plain day or (imperceptibly perhaps) at night. Poetry, we have suggested, is especially in sympathy with the otherness of animals and with the notion of unsubstitutable singularity. As Ted Hughes puts it, in the context of a discussion of the experience of composing a poem: ‘the poem is a new species of creature, a new specimen of the life outside your own’ (Hughes 1967, 17). Every poem would be a differ- ent creature, looking at its author and each of its readers in a unique way, bespeaking a being unlike any other poem or any other kind of text. This is perhaps what poetic originality or genius entails (no pun intended). The association that Derrida makes between poetry and animals might lead us to the supposition that the more poetic a novel, short story or play is, the more likely we are to
		- find animals pervading and haunting it. We could consider, for example, Shakespeare (for whose animals a supplementary volume of the Introduction to Literature, Criticism and Theory would be required), Herman Melville (author of that whale of a book, Moby-Dick), Franz Kafka or Elizabeth Bowen. Let us just briefly recall one or two instances from the last two of these writers. One of Kafka’s greatest short fictions, ‘The Burrow’ (written in 1923), begins with the following immortal sentence: ‘I have completed the construction of my burrow and it seems to be successful’ (Kafka 1992, 325). The narrator is, apparently, a burrowing animal: thinking, to recall Derrida’s formulation, perhaps begins there. We never discover quite what size or indeed what species this burrowing creature is, but we are drawn nonetheless into the fascination and strangeness of a kind of poetic, imper- ceptible place. As Deleuze and Guattari nicely observe in Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature(1986): ‘Kafka is fascinated by everything that is small. If he doesn’t seem to like children that is because they are caught in an irreversible becoming-big; the animal kingdom, in contrast, involves smallness and imper- ceptibility’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1986, 37). Elizabeth Bowen, on the other hand, does not so much write from the point of view of animals, as let animals roam, flap around, animate and haunt her writing. Just two of very many158 An introduction to literature, criticism and theory instances from her novel Friends and Relations (1931) may suffice. A car departs from a country railway station with avian effects: ‘Then his Aunt Janet drove off rapidly; water went up in wings from some deep puddles’ (65). And, a little later, a hot summer day in a local market town is evoked through a sort of soundless feline music: ‘A cat’s yawn gave the note of the afternoon. Pavements sleepily glared; over the butcher’s a piano played in its sleep’ (80). (That last example leaves us not only with the subtle enchantment of a cat’s yawn, but also the easily missed rawness of ‘the butcher’s’.) Despite the pervasive or recurrent presence of animals in such works, it is as if, to borrow a formulation from Akira Mizuta Lippit, they ‘exist in a state of perpetual vanishing’ (Lippit 2000, 1). They haunt these texts. It’s like the White Rabbit, or the Cheshire Cat, or so many other animals in Lewis Carroll’s Alicebooks. It’s like the Ghost in Hamlet, momentarily evoked as a mole under the earth, or beneath the stage. ‘Well said, old mole!’ exclaims Hamlet, but it has already shifted away: as he goes on to ask, ‘Canst work i’ th’ earth so fast?’ (1.5.170). Focusing attention on the appearances and disap- pearances of such animals (metaphorical or literal, fabulous or recognizable) can perhaps enable us to think differently not only about poetry but also about the ‘poetic’ in literature more generally. We conclude with another creature that has made ghostly appearances in literature across the ages, from Homer’s Iliadto Shakespeare’s Richard III(I, ii, 100) to Beckett’s Company, namely the hedgehog. Perhaps the best-known correlation between the hedgehog and a work of art is the one made by the German philosopher and poet Friedrich von Schlegel, who wrote, in 1798, regarding the literary or philosophical fragment: ‘Like a little work of art, a fragment must be totally detached from the surrounding world and closed on itself like a hedgehog’ (quoted in Derrida 1995b, 302). In a wonderful little text called ‘Che cos’è la poesia?’ (in English, ‘What is poetry?’ or ‘What is the thing called poetry?’), Derrida obliquely explores this and other figures, trans- forming
		- these into a new way of thinking about the poetic in relation to the ‘humble’ hedgehog (see Derrida 1995b, 288–99, 301–3). Derrida’s hedge- hog is a figure for what it is that makes us love language, what makes us want to remember a poem or a phrase or even a feeling or experience, what makes us want to ‘learn by heart’. A poem, he proposes, is ‘that very thing that teaches the heart’ and even ‘invents the heart’ (Derrida 1995b, 295). It’s a kind of ghostly hedgehog that has nothing to do with ‘literary poetry’ (297), with self- enclosed fragments or sonnets or epic poems. The hedgehog cannot be owned. It is a creature that attests to otherness, and above all perhaps to mortality and to the otherness of death that affects human and non-human animals alike. It is difficult to say whether Derrida’s little text is a work of philosophy or literaryAnimals 159 theory or poetry. Correspondingly, the poetic nature of this hedgehog cannot, he suggests, be confined to any genre, poetic, literary or otherwise. Further reading In accord with the logic of what we have argued in this chapter, perhaps the best place to pursue further reading is in the work of poets rather than critics or theorists: D.H. Lawrence, William Blake, Shakespeare, Elizabeth Bishop, Ted Hughes, Les Murray, Francis Ponge and so many others. And Kafka’s stories tell us as much about animals and literature, animals in literature, or animal literature, as any critical or theoretical writings. Literary works such as those we have been discussing in this chapter point towards a sense of the text as (in Hélène Cixous’s phrase) a ‘poetic-animal machine’ (Cixous 1998) and towards a thinking in terms of what Deleuze and Guattari have called ‘becoming animal’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1986). Among the burgeoning growth of critical and theoretical material, there are in addition several espe- cially stimulating books. For a short introductory account, Greg Garrard has a useful chapter on ‘Animals’ in his book Ecocriticism (2004). Of a more demanding nature, Zoontologies: The Question of the Animal(2003), ed. Cary Wolfe, is an excellent collection of poststructuralist, posthumanist inter- disciplinary essays. So, too, is Knowing Animals, ed. Lawrence Simmons and Philip Armstrong (2007). Cary Wolfe has also written a fine study with a more specifically American focus, Animal Rites: American Culture, the Discourse of Species, and Posthumanism(2003), while Philip Armstrong’s What Animals Mean in the Fiction of Modernity(2008) looks at literary works from Daniel Defoe and Jonathan Swift to Will Self and J.M. Coetzee. For a very helpful study focusing on the early modern period, see Erica Fudge’s Perceiving Animals: Humans and Beasts in Early Modern English Culture(2002). For work in a more predominantly philosophical vein, see Animal Others: On Ethics, Ontology, and Animal Life(1999), ed. Peter H. Steeves, and Matthew Calarco’s Zoographies: The Question of the Animal from Heidegger to Derrida (2008). Akira Mazuta Lippit’s Electric Animal: Toward a Rhetoric of Wildlife (2000) is a compelling but challenging work that brilliantly explores the ‘ques- tion of the animal’ across philosophy, science and psychoanalysis, as well as literature and cinema. Derrida’s The Animal That Therefore I Am(2008) is an extremely rich and complex set of essays that forms a crucial point of reference in many of the aforementioned secondary works. For two collections of essays especially concerned with the elaboration of Derrida’s work in this area, see Derridanimals, a special issue of the Oxford Literary Review(2007), ed. Neil Badmington, and Demenageries(2009), ed. Anne Berger and Marta Segarra.

			- Set the Scene
				- The beginning of a piece of literature is crucial in setting the scene for what is to come. It often has specific characteristics such as being engaging and attention-grabbing, and is usually in close proximity to a crucial element such as an encounter, event, mission, dungeon, or raid. This adds tension and drama, and can create a sense of urgency and anticipation for the reader.

			- Set the Theme
				- Setting the theme is an important aspect of the beginning of a piece of literature. It works hand in hand with setting the scene, with the two elements being developed simultaneously. This dualistic approach ensures that the scene clearly represents all the thematic requirements set by the author. The beginning theme and scene must be the best executed concept of the story, as it sets the foundation for the rest of the narrative. A well-crafted beginning theme and scene can captivate the reader and set the tone for the story's themes and messages.

			- Set the Protagonist
				- To create a compelling beginning in literature, it is crucial to set the scene and establish the protagonist's role in the narrative. The protagonist must be introduced in a way that immediately captures the reader's attention and establishes their opposition to the controlling theme. The protagonist's sentimental charge must be opposite to that of the controlling theme, creating a sense of tension and conflict that propels the story forward. Additionally, the levels of the protagonist's relationships must be in close proximity to the terminal consequence, which can be an ending, evolving, or beginning. From the start of the beginning, to its end, the protagonist and controlling theme must undergo a reversal of sentimental charge, providing a sense of deep emotional connection and total commitment to the author. By carefully crafting the beginning of a story, authors can effectively draw readers into the narrative and set the foundation for the protagonist's journey.

						- If the controlling theme's sentimental charge is positive, then the protagonist's sentimental charge must be negative. etc.
						- Levels of the Protagonist's relationships must be in very close proximity to terminal consequence.
							- Ending
							- Evolving
							- Beginning
						- The protagonist and controlling theme must begin and end in a reversal of sentimental charge.
						- The protagonist is often the product of scene, and theme and should be developed afterwards.
			- Set the Tone
				- Setting the tone is an essential component of creating a compelling beginning in literature. The beginning language should be designed with extreme polar variations of the narrator's attitude and disposition, which are documented and established by the author or "skipper." The opening tone should also consider the controlling theme, which is obligatory central idea or message. The tone should be consistent with the controlling theme, whether it is serious, humorous, melancholy, or hopeful. By carefully crafting the beginning language and tone, authors can effectively set the stage for the rest of the narrative, drawing readers into the story and creating an emotional connection with the protagonist.
					- 1.5 Set the Tone
						- Beginning Language is designed with the most extreme polar variations of the narrator's attitude and disposition
						- The narrator's attitude and disposition is documented and set by the skipper
						- The opening tone should consider the following
							- the controlling theme
			- Set Depth and Richness
				- To create depth and richness in literature, authors can incorporate references to classical literature, mythology, Biblical texts, and other sources of cultural or historical significance. These references can add layers of meaning and background to the narrative, creating a sense of depth and richness that can enhance the reader's experience. Intertextuality, or the use of other texts as a reference, is an overlooked yet essential element of literature. By incorporating intertextual references, authors can pay homage to the works that have influenced their own writing, add depth and richness to their narratives, and encourage readers to explore other works that are related to the story. Overall, setting depth and richness in literature can be achieved through intentional intertextuality, which can enrich the reader's understanding of the narrative and the world it inhabits.
					- 1.6 Set Depth and Richness
						- Reference to classical literature, mythology, Biblical text, etc. can insinuate deeper meaning and rich background.
						- Such intertextuality is an overlooked yet essential element of literature
			- The Opener and Follower
				- Crafting a compelling beginning in literature involves careful attention to both the opener line and the follower line. The opener line must embody at least two of the previously stated elements, whether it be setting the theme, introducing the protagonist, or establishing the tone. It must be elegantly designed and carefully crafted to convey the author's intent and demonstrate a total comprehension of the craft of writing. The follower line, which is the sentence immediately following the opener, should cover the remaining beginner's elements. It should continue to draw the reader in and expand upon the elements introduced in the opener line. By skillfully crafting both the opener and follower lines, authors can create a powerful beginning that sets the stage for the rest of the narrative and captivates the reader's attention.
					- 1.7.1 The Opener Line
						- The opening line must embody at least 2 of the previously stated elements.
						- Elegance and well thought out design will not result in a sentence that will function with random permutations but will manifest from well-thought out intent, total comprehension of craft, and confidence.
					- 1.7.2 The Follower Line
						- The follower line, the sentence immediately proceeding the opener, should cover the remainder of the beginner's elements.

	- ## 2.0 In Media Res and the Paradox of Beginnings
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### 2.1 Introduction
		- The world of literature is vast and diverse, with countless techniques and elements used by authors to create captivating stories. In this paper, we will explore several key aspects of beginnings in literature, including the Law of Chicken Eggs, the concept of In Media Res, and the Paradox of Beginnings.
		- ### 2.2 The Law of Chicken Eggs
		- The Law of Chicken Eggs is a concept that challenges the idea of an absolute beginning. Instead, it suggests that every beginning is simply a continuation of something else. This means that even when we start something new, there is always a history, a context, and a narrative that has led up to that moment.
		- To illustrate this concept, we can look at the example of a chicken egg. When we see a chicken egg, we might assume that it is the beginning of a new life. However, in reality, the egg is simply a continuation of a process that began when the chicken was born. The chicken was raised by its mother, ate food, and eventually laid the egg. The egg is just one part of a larger process, and it is not an absolute beginning.
		- Similarly, in literature, there is always a context and history that informs the beginning of a story. The characters, settings, and plot points all have a backstory that has led up to the moment we begin reading. This backstory might not be explicitly stated, but it is always present, and it informs the narrative that follows.
		- The Law of Chicken Eggs challenges the idea of a clear, absolute beginning, and encourages us to think about the larger context and history that informs the present moment. It reminds us that every beginning is a continuation of something else, and that the past is always present in the present. By considering the Law of Chicken Eggs, we can create richer, more nuanced narratives that take into account the complexities of the world around us.
		- ### 2.3 In Media Res
		- In Media Res is a Latin term that translates to "in the midst of things." It refers to a narrative technique where a story begins in the middle of a sequence of events, rather than at the beginning of the story. This technique is used to create intrigue and suspense, as readers are immediately thrown into the action without knowing how the story began.
		- A story that begins in the middle of a story, literally, might start in the midst of a battle, with characters fighting and struggling to survive. This technique can be used to create a sense of immediacy and urgency, as readers are immediately drawn into the conflict.
		- Metaphorically, a story that begins in media res might start in the middle of a character's emotional journey or personal conflict. This technique can be used to create a sense of mystery and intrigue, as readers are left to wonder what led the character to this point.
		- In Media Res can be a powerful narrative technique, as it immediately draws readers into the story and creates a sense of urgency and suspense. It can also be used to subvert expectations, as readers are thrown into the middle of the action without knowing how the story began. By using this technique, authors can create engaging, dynamic narratives that keep readers hooked from beginning to end.
		- ### 2.4 The Paradox of Beginnings
		- The Paradox of Beginnings is a complex concept that highlights the idea that beginnings can also be endings. When considering how to begin a story, authors must consider several principles, including the uncanny, unconventional and digressive structure, vivid sensory descriptions, suspense, mystery, and foreboding. These principles can help create a compelling beginning that draws readers in and encourages them to continue reading.
		- The uncanny refers to the sense of unease or discomfort that arises when something is both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. By incorporating elements of the uncanny into the beginning of a story, authors can create a sense of tension and mystery that captivates the reader.
		- Unconventional and digressive structures can also be used to great effect in the beginning of a story. By starting in the middle of a narrative or using non-linear structures, authors can create intrigue and encourage readers to think critically about the narrative.
		- Vivid sensory descriptions are also a key element of effective beginnings in literature. By immersing the reader in the world of the story and engaging their senses, authors can create a powerful emotional connection that draws readers in.
		- Suspense, mystery, and foreboding are all important principles to consider when crafting a beginning. These elements can create tension and anticipation, encouraging readers to continue reading to find out what happens next.
		- When considering how we begin stories, there are many possible starting points. Birth, creation myths, Christian theology, symbolism, societal themes, and the human condition are all potential starting points that can shape the narrative that follows.
		- Similarly, how we end a story can be just as important as how we begin it. By considering how an ending can be a beginning, and vice versa, authors can create a sense of closure while still leaving the reader wanting more. Structural techniques like bookending and the negation of sentimental charge can also be effective tools for creating powerful endings that leave a lasting impact on readers.
	- ## 3.0 Strong Thematic Beginnings with Controlling Literary Elements
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### 3.1 Introduction
		- Iconic Beginnings in literature are characterized by a clear and precise understanding of Topos, Controlling Themes, and Duality. The author must have a commanding knowledge of the chosen literary element and must have chosen a literary element that serves as the primary method of thematic distribution throughout the story. These requirements, combined with the concepts previously discussed, will display the author's mastery and comprehension of the craft of writing.
		- ### 3.2 Strong Thematic Design
		- A strong thematic design is an essential component of creating a compelling and impactful work of literature. The core concept of strong thematic design is centered around the idea of dramatic proofing, which refers to the ability of a theme to express itself through multiple literary devices and elements. This network of meaning is held together by the dynamic strength of a strong theme and is explored through rapid semantic charge oscillations as the story progresses. The result is a robust and nuanced network of meaning that creates depth and richness characteristic of great literature. By utilizing a strong thematic design, authors can create a narrative that resonates with readers, exploring complex ideas and concepts in a way that engages and challenges their audience.
		- ### 3.3 Controlling Literary Elements
		- Controlling Literary Elements play a vital role in constructing a strong beginning in literature. These elements include but are not limited to: setting, tone, style, point of view, symbolism, and characterization. These elements can be used to support and amplify the theme of the story. It is important to note that controlling literary elements and themes are dualistic and must be developed together to create a strong beginning. For example, the tone of the story can be used to enhance the theme of the narrative, creating an emotional connection with the reader. The setting can also be used to reflect the themes and messages of the story, setting the tone for the narrative.
		- Several authors in the English Literary Canon are known for their mastery of controlling literary elements in the beginning of their works. For instance, in Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities," the setting of the story (Paris and London during the French Revolution) sets the tone for the novel's themes of revolution and sacrifice. In Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," the use of multiple narrators, including letters and journal entries, creates a unique and powerful point of view that supports the novel's themes of isolation and the consequences of playing god.
		- In summary, controlling literary elements are critical components in constructing a strong beginning in literature. These elements, when developed in tandem with the theme of the story, create a cohesive and powerful narrative that resonates with readers. By studying the works of literary greats, aspiring writers can learn the art of using controlling literary elements to enhance the themes and messages of their own works.
		- ### 3.4 Monuments of Literary Beginnings
		- The beginnings of literary monuments are often characterized by the author's skillful use of controlling literary elements and themes.
		- The examples given, such as Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Virginia Woolf's Orlando, illustrate how authors have used specific literary elements to convey their themes.
			- ### 3.4.1 Austin's Pride
			- In the case of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice," the beginning is crafted with precision to reflect the author's style and the novel's theme of marriage and social class. Austen's witty, ironic, and playful style is immediately evident in the opening sentence: "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." This statement sets the tone for the novel's satirical and humorous commentary on society's expectations regarding marriage and wealth.
			- The beginning also establishes the importance of social class in the novel, with the mention of a wealthy single man being in want of a wife. The rest of the opening chapter further emphasizes this theme, with the arrival of Mr. Bingley, a wealthy gentleman, to the neighborhood, and the reactions of the local families to his presence. The control of the literary element of style, in conjunction with the theme of marriage and social class, creates a strong beginning that draws the reader in and sets the stage for the rest of the novel.
			- *Austin's Pride*
				- Author's Style // Marriage and Social Class

			- ### 3.4.2 Twainberry
			- In Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," the beginning is marked by the unique and memorable voice of the protagonist, Huck Finn. The use of an uneducated, colloquial dialect in the narration of the story sets the tone for the entire novel, and immediately draws the reader in. The choice of a young, uneducated narrator allows Twain to comment on social and moral values of the time, as well as to explore themes such as the nature of friendship and freedom. The colloquial language and Huck's distinctive voice give the reader a sense of authenticity and immediacy, allowing them to experience the story on a more personal level. By beginning the novel with such a strong and memorable voice, Twain sets the stage for a powerful and impactful story.

			- ### 3.4.3 Melville's Dick
			- Herman Melville's Moby-Dick is a literary masterpiece known for its complexity and depth, which is reflected in its beginning. The controlling literary element in the novel's opening is its tone and mood, which serves to establish the novel's themes of obsession and nature. Melville's use of striking imagery, metaphorical resonance, multiple perspectives, and complex narrative structure immediately draws the reader into the story and sets the stage for the rest of the narrative.
			- The opening lines of Moby-Dick, "Call me Ishmael," are iconic and memorable, introducing the novel's narrator and protagonist in a unique way. The narrator's voice sets the tone for the entire novel, and the use of multiple perspectives, including the narrator's own thoughts and feelings, creates a layered and complex narrative structure that mirrors the theme of obsession that pervades the novel.
			- Melville's use of metaphorical resonance is also evident in the beginning of the novel, with references to biblical stories and classical literature that add depth and meaning to the story. The novel's opening lines, "Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul," create a vivid sensory description that establishes the mood and tone of the novel, and sets the stage for the exploration of the theme of nature as a force that is beyond human control.

				- Tone and Mood // Obsession and Nature
				- Herman Melville's Moby-Dick
				- Tone and Mood
					- striking imagery
					- metaphorical resonance
					- multiple perspectives
					- complex narrative structure
			- ### 3.4.4 Orlando's Standard
			- In Virginia Woolf's "Orlando," the beginning sets the stage for the exploration of themes related to rhetoric, identity, and time. The use of equative rhetoric creates a sense of fluidity and non-committedness, as the narrator describes Orlando's gender as "he" in one moment and "she" in the next. This use of rhetoric reflects the exploration of identity throughout the novel, as Orlando's gender and sense of self shift and change over time. The nonlinear structure of the narrative further emphasizes the themes of identity and time, as the story moves backwards and forwards through different eras and perspectives. The fluidity of the rhetoric and narrative structure creates a sense of openness and possibility, inviting readers to consider the complexities of identity and the passage of time.

			- ### 3.4.5 Soldier's Ford
			- The use of an unreliable narrator in literature can be a powerful tool to create a sense of mystery and uncertainty from the very beginning of the story. Ford Madox Ford's "The Good Soldier" is a great example of this technique. The use of an unreliable narrator is particularly effective when exploring themes of memory and truth, which are central to the novel's plot. The unreliable narrator creates a complex interplay between the reader and the narrator, forcing the reader to question the narrator's version of events and leading to an exploration of the nature of truth and memory. The deception that results from the narrator's unreliability adds tension and drama to the story, drawing the reader in and propelling the plot forward. Overall, the use of an unreliable narrator is a unique and effective way to begin a story, and can set the stage for a complex and thought-provoking exploration of themes.

			- ### 3.4.6 Proustine!
			- Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past" opens with a vivid description of sensory experience that sets the stage for the Proustian Moment that will drive the narrative. The Proustian Moment is a powerful sensory experience that triggers involuntary memories and perceptions. Through sensory imagery and the use of psychosomatic triggers, Proust explores the themes of memory and perception. The beginning of the novel creates a sense of intrigue and curiosity, drawing the reader into the story and setting the stage for the exploration of memory and perception that will follow. The use of sensory detail and memory triggers is a hallmark of Proust's writing and adds depth and complexity to his exploration of the human experience.
