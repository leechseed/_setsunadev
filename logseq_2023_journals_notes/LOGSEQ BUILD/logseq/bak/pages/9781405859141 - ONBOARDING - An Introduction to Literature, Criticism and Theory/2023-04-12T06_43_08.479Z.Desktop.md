		- **1.1**

			- When will we have begun? Where – or when – does a literary text begin? This question raises a series of fundamental problems in literary criticism and theory. Does a text begin as the author puts his or her ﬁrst mark on a piece of paper or keys in the ﬁrst word on a computer? Does it begin with the ﬁrst idea about a story or poem, or in the childhood of the writer, for instance? Or does the text only begin as the reader picks up the book? Does the text begin with its title, or with the ﬁrst word of the so-called ‘body’ of the text? 
			  This extraordinary opening sentence is all about beginnings. Thematically, it establishes the poem to be about the ﬁrst disobedience of Adam and Eve which ‘Brought death into the world, and all our woe’. But it is also about itself as a beginning: it assures us that this is the ﬁrst time that such a project has been attempted (‘Things unattempt yet in prose or rhyme’). It is as if the opening to a poem could be the equivalent of a moon-landing – one small step for John Milton ...Rather differently, the opening sentence is about itself as a beginning in the sense that it is asking the ‘Heavenly Muse’ for inspiration. It is about the way that poems are conventionally thought to begin – in inspiration. This produces a strange paradox of beginnings: the origin of the poem, inspiration, comes after the beginning of the poem. In other ways, too, Milton’s opening unsettles any simple notion of opening or beginning. Not only does the poem talk about a beginning (the eating of the fruit of know-ledge) but it also refers to a future return to a time before that beginning (‘regain the blissful seat’), a restoration which will be both the beginning of a new age and a repetition of a previous state.
			  There is another way in which this beginning is not a beginning: it repeatedly refers us back to other texts. Milton refers to Moses (‘That shepherd’) in the belief that he ‘taught’ the children of Israel the creation story – in other words, that he wrote the opening books of the Old Testament. In this respect, the muse that Milton’s poem addresses and invokes is a second-hand muse. Contrary to its claims to originality, this opening echoes and alludes to various other openings. ‘Of man’s ﬁrst disobedience . . . Sing Heavenly Muse’ repeats the conventional apostrophe of such classical openings as Homer’s Iliad and Virgil’s Aeneid; ‘In the beginning’ repeats the opening to the Gospel according to St John (‘In the beginning was the Word’), and so on. Finally, the very syntax of Milton’s sentence displaces the beginning of the poem, in particular by holding back the main verb of the sentence – ‘Sing’ – until line six.

			- This passage explores the question of when and where a literary text begins, and how this question poses fundamental problems in literary criticism and theory.
			- Using John Milton's "Paradise Lost" as an example, the passage discusses how the opening sentence of the poem is both thematically about the story of Adam and Eve and also about the poem's own beginning, claiming to be a new and unattempted project.
			- The passage also notes how the opening unsettles any simple notion of beginning, as it refers to a future return to a time before the beginning and alludes to various other texts.
			- Finally, the passage highlights the syntax of Milton's sentence as a way of delaying the beginning of the poem, with the main verb 'Sing' held back until line six.
		- **1.2**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Despite the complications of Milton’s opening, however, at least it tries (or pretends to try) to begin at the beginning, rather than in the middle. Beginning in the middle – in medias res – is the other way to begin. One of the most famous beginnings-in-the-middle is Dante’s opening to The Divine Comedy (c. 1307–20): There are at least three different middles here: the middle of ‘our life’, the middle of a dark wood, the middle of a narrative. Dante conﬂates life, journey and narrative, and suggests the uncanny terror of beginning at such a moment of middling. In particular, the uncanniness of ‘mi ritrovai’ suggests the hallucinatory terror of (re-)ﬁnding, of retrieving oneself. But Dante’s opening might also suggest that there are no absolute beginnings – only strange originary middles. No journey, no life, no narrative ever really begins: all have in some sense already begun before they begin. But this is not to say that we can do without the concept of the beginning. Where would we be without a beginning? Where would a text be?
			  The paradox of the beginning having already begun is wittily presented by Laurence Sterne in the opening of his novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759) in terms of both the beginning of a narrative and the beginning of a life:
			  This opening is a comic version of Philip Larkin’s equivocal opening line to his poem ‘This Be The Verse’ (1974): ‘They fuck you up, your mum and dad’. Tristram Shandy complains because his parents were thinking of something else at the moment of his conception and he is afraid that in consequence his whole life has been fucked up. As his uncle Toby remarks a few pages later, ‘My Tristram’s misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the world’ (7). Tristram Shandy famously confronts the intractable problem of how to end an autobiography: such a text can never catch up with itself because it takes longer to write about life than it takes to live it. In this sense, no autobiography can ever end. But Tristram Shandy is also about how to begin – how to begin at the beginning – and how we begin.

			- This passage explores the concept of beginning in literature, specifically focusing on two ways of beginning: starting from the beginning and starting in medias res.
			- Dante's "Divine Comedy" is used as an example of beginning in the middle, with the opening sentence suggesting the uncanny terror of starting in the middle of life, journey, and narrative.
			- The passage also notes that the idea of a true beginning may be a paradox, as everything has in some sense already begun before it begins.
			- The passage then discusses Laurence Sterne's comic opening of "Tristram Shandy," which confronts the problem of how to begin an autobiography and how to end it.
			- The passage suggests that the idea of the beginning and the end is important in literature, despite the paradoxical nature of such concepts.
		- **1.3**
		  collapsed:: true
			- If beginnings always have a context and are therefore determined by what comes before, the opening to Tristram Shandy also makes it clear that, in turn, beginnings determine what comes after. This is true of literary as of other beginnings: beginnings augur, acting like promises for what is to come. Such is the force of many well-known literary beginnings. The opening to Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice (1813) is apparently unequivocal: ‘It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife’ (1). This sets the stage for the whole novel. The topic is marriage, the tone is ironic. Austen proclaims the values of universalism (‘a truth universally acknowledged’), while satirizing them: what is acknowledged as a truth for upper middle-class men in early nineteenth-century England is not necessarily acknowledged universally. Before going on to pro-vide an ‘Explanatory’ note on its dialect, Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer’s Comrade) (1885) begins with a ‘notice’:
			  At once witty and bafﬂing, the sentence is both an entrance and a barrier to the novel. It reads something like the sentence ‘Do not read this sentence’, in that it both acknowledges that readers do try to ﬁnd motives and morals in narratives, and comically prohibits such a reading. Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick; or, The Whale (1851) is also framed by a number of what Gérard Genette calls ‘peritexts’ (Genette 1987) – by a contents page, a dedication, an ‘Etymology’ (of the word ‘Whale’) and ‘Extracts’ (several pages of quotations about whales) – before it begins with the famous words ‘Call me Ishmael’. Satirical prevarication and pedantry, combined with blustering assertiveness, characterize the whole novel. Virginia Woolf ’s Orlando (1928) opens (after a dedication, preface, contents page and list of illustrations) with a sentence that equivocates by appearing not to do so: ‘He – for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it – was in the act of slicing at the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters’ (13). The sentence begins a book about a person of uncertain or variable gender in a tone of strange uncertainty, with a suggestive mixture of decapitation and castration. By appearing not to, this opening sentence, like the novel as a whole, subtly undermines conventional ideas about gender identity. The ﬁrst sentence of Ford Madox Ford’s The Good Soldier (1915) is sheer heart-tugging seduction: ‘This is the saddest story I have ever heard’ (7). It is the sort of sentence from which a novel might never recover. And Proust’s famous under-stated opening to Remembrance of Things Past (1913–27) implies that there is no single beginning: ‘Longtemps, je me suis couché de bonne heure’ (‘For a long time I used to go to bed early’, 13). A studied reﬂection on the past, a sense of intimacy, the power of habit and repetition are what characterize Proust’s 3,000-page novel. As these examples suggest, one of the peculiarities of literary openings is that they are never single. The openings to Huckleberry Finn, Moby-Dick and Orlando produce multiple beginnings through their ‘peritexts’, but the other examples also present more than one beginning: The Good Soldier suggests both a story and its retelling (as well as other stories that are not as sad), while Proust’s opening gives a sense that narrative begins in repetition, that no single event can be said to be a beginning.

			- This passage explores how literary beginnings determine what comes after them and how they act as promises for what is to come.
			- The passage discusses several well-known literary openings, including Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice," Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick," Virginia Woolf's "Orlando," Ford Madox Ford's "The Good Soldier," and Marcel Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past."
			- The examples illustrate how literary openings are never single and how they produce multiple beginnings through peritexts, retellings, and a sense of repetition.
			- The passage also notes how literary openings can be ironic, comical, or subversive, challenging conventional ideas and values.

		  collapsed:: true
			- As we have begun to see, one of the ways in which a literary text multi-plies its beginning is through the deployment of peritexts – titles, subtitles, dedications, epigraphs, introductions, ‘notices’ and so on. A classic example would be the opening of T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land (1922). Before we arrive at the ﬁrst words of Eliot’s poem we encounter a series of multilingual hurdles. To start with, there is the title. The title, like all titles, is uncertainly poised between inside and outside. It both names the poem, as if from outside, and forms part of that poem. ‘The Waste Land’ both refers to a place or predicament – post-1918 Europe, for example – and names the strange ‘land’ that Eliot’s poem creates (like a waste land, the poem is full of debris from the past, fragmentary memories and quotations). Next we encounter the Latin and Greek of Petronius: ‘Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi in ampulla pendere, et cum illi pueri dicerent: ΣCβυλλα τC Θελεις; respondebat illa: Aποθαυειυ ΘBλω’ (‘For once I myself saw with my own eyes the Sibyl at Cumae hanging in a cage, and when the boys said to her “Sibyl, what do you want?” she replied, “I want to die” ’). As an epigraph, this quotation too may be said to be both inside and outside the poem, both a commentary on and a part of the text. The next hurdle is a tribute in Italian to Ezra Pound: ‘il miglior fabbro’ (‘the better craftsman’). Pound, as editor, was responsible for much of the ﬁnal shape of Eliot’s poem and therefore is in part the crafts-man of what follows. Even this tribute is a quotation: it comes from Dante’s Purgatorio and is in this sense too both part of Eliot’s poem and not part of it. Finally, there is a subtitle: ‘1. The Burial of the Dead’. This is a quotation from the Anglican burial service. Then we have what appear to be the ﬁrst words of the poem:
			  In these and other ways, Eliot’s poem displaces its own beginning. The beginning of the poem is no longer the ﬁrst stroke of the pen or keyboard. Through emphatic effects of intertextuality (including quotation, allusion, reference and echo), Eliot’s poem suggests that originality, the notion of beginning as singular, deﬁnable, stable is severely problematic. To ask where or when Eliot’s poem begins is to meet with a series of questions concerning the identity of the author, the text and reader, and ﬁnally of the Western literary tradition generally.

		- **1.5**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The Waste Land may seem to be unusually concerned with questions of origins and their displacement. But the kinds of effects of intertextuality that this opening explores are in fact fundamental to literary texts more generally. Literary texts, that is to say, are always constructed by and within a context or tradition. In his well-known essay ‘Tradition and the Individual Talent’ (1919), Eliot himself argues that ‘No poet, no artist of any art, has his [sic] complete meaning alone’: rather, what is important is the poet’s ‘relation to the dead poets and artists’ (Eliot 1975, 38). A poem, novel or play that does not in some sense relate to previous texts is, in fact, literally unimaginable. The author of such a text would have to invent everything. It would be like inventing a new language from scratch, without any reliance on already existing languages. In this sense, intertextuality (the displacement of origins to other texts, which are in turn displacements of other texts and so on – in other words, an undoing of the very idea of pure or straightforward origins) is fundamental to the institution of literature. No text makes sense without other texts. Every text is what Roland Barthes calls ‘a new tissue of past citations’ (Barthes 1981, 39).
			  Two of the most compelling and most persistent myths of literary texts concern their origins. The ﬁrst is the idea that the most important aspect of any reading is an imagined meeting of the reader’s mind with that of the author – an idea that exempliﬁes what has been known, since a famous essay of that name (1946 rev. 1954), as the ‘intentional fallacy’ (the mistaken belief that what the author intended is the ‘real’, ‘ﬁnal’ meaning of the work and that we can or should know what this is (see Wimsatt and Beardsley 1995)). But if we cannot know the beginnings of a text in terms of what is available to us on the page, how much more difﬁcult it would be to discover the origins of the thought which impels the text. Does an author know where these thoughts come from? Are they in fact thoughts (conscious, coherent, consistent)?Whose ‘thoughts’ do we read when we read the beginning of The Waste Land? Eliot’s, Chaucer’s, Pound’s, Petronius’, Dante’s? Are they still the poet’s thoughts if the poet is said to be ‘inspired’? The second common myth involves the priority given to an individual reader’s ﬁrst reading of a text. According to this myth, all literary criticism involves a corruption of the original ‘experience’ of reading. Once upon a time (so this myth goes) we were able to read a novel (by Charlotte Brontë, say, or J.K. Rowling) and have a completely unadulterated reading experience, unsullied by any critical thinking or complexity. But although we often talk about literary texts as though they have been subjected to only one reading, we all know that this is in many respects simply a convenient ﬁction. Roland Barthes, in his book S/Z (1970), makes a point about the act of rereading as ‘an operation contrary to the commercial and ideological habits of our society’ and suggests that it is ‘tolerated only in certain marginal categories of readers (children, old people and professors)’ (Barthes 1990b, 15–16).
		- 1.5.1.1
		  collapsed:: true
			- Indeed, the idea of a single, unadulterated reading experience is a myth. Every reading of a literary text is shaped by the reader’s own context, experiences, and understanding of the world. Even on a second or third reading, a text can never be experienced in the same way twice. This is not to say that critical thinking or analysis necessarily corrupts the reading experience. In fact, engaging with a text critically can enhance one’s understanding and appreciation of it. As Barthes suggests, rereading can reveal new insights and perspectives on a text, and can be a valuable tool for readers of all ages and backgrounds.
		- 1.5.1.2
		  collapsed:: true
			- The idea of a single, definitive meaning of a literary text is also problematic. As we have seen, literary texts are constructed within a context of other texts, and their meanings are always shaped by this intertextual relationship. The meaning of a text is never ﬁxed or ﬁnal, but is always in ﬂux, subject to interpretation and re-interpretation. This is why literary texts continue to be read and studied long after their authors have passed away – they offer a rich and complex site for exploration and interpretation, and can reveal new insights and meanings over time.
		- 1.5.1.3
		  collapsed:: true
			- In conclusion, the beginnings of literary texts are always complex and multifaceted, shaped by their intertextual relationships with other texts, as well as by the reader’s own context and understanding. The idea of a single, definitive reading or meaning is a myth, and literary texts continue to be read and studied precisely because they are open to interpretation and re-interpretation.
		- **1.6**

			- Professors – who are usually old people, very seldom children, though not infrequently an undecidable mixture of the two – include Roland Barthes, of course, and it is part of his aim to question the very idea of a single or ﬁrst reading. Rereading, he argues, contests the claim which would have us believe that the ﬁrst reading is a primary, naïve, phenomenal reading which we will only, afterwards, have to ‘explicate’, to intellectualize (as if there were a beginning of reading, as if everything were not already read: there is no ﬁrst reading . . . ). (Barthes 1990b, 16)

			  Once again, Eliot’s The Waste Land suggests some of the complexities involved in a ﬁrst reading. If the opening to Eliot’s poem refers to Chaucer’s, then when can we properly be said to read ‘April is the cureless month’? Surely we must reread it, once we have read it, with Chaucer’s words in mind. In which case the ﬁrst reading is inadequate. Less dramatically, perhaps, the same may be said of any other literary text: every reading (even a so-called ‘ﬁrst reading’) is at least in part a learned or programmed response, conditioned by other and others’ readings. In this respect, reading critically is, in T.S. Eliot’s words, ‘as inevitable as breathing’ (Eliot 1975, 37).
			  The present book is, fundamentally, about questions of origins, about beginning. It is concerned with how we might begin to read, to think about and write about literary texts. In particular, the book is about those uncertain origins – the author, the reader and the text – none of which can ever be taken for granted. Neither author nor reader nor text ﬁnally or properly constitutes a beginning. As with ‘beginning literary studies’ (which we have begun now, haven’t we?), the idea that everything begins with the author or with the reader or with one particular text is both deeply compelling and deeply false.
		- 1.6.1
		  collapsed:: true
			- The idea of a single beginning or origin for literary texts, whether it be the author, the reader, or a particular text, is a deeply compelling but false notion. This book is fundamentally concerned with exploring questions of origins and how we can begin to read, think about, and write about literary texts in light of this understanding. Intertextuality, or the displacement of origins through references and allusions to other texts, is fundamental to literature, and every reading, even a so-called "first reading," is conditioned by other readings that have come before. Ultimately, the idea of a singular or straightforward origin is problematic, and we must approach literary texts with a critical and open mind, recognizing the complexities and uncertainties involved in their creation and interpretation.

	- ### 2 Readers and Reading
		- **2.1**
		  collapsed:: true
			- In Percy Bysshe Shelley’s famous sonnet ‘Ozymandias’ (1818) the narrator speaks of meeting a traveler who reports having seen a vast shattered statue strewn across the desert. The statue is of Ozymandias, the thirteenth-century bc King Rameses II of Egypt (Ozymandias is the Greek name for this king). All that remains of the King of Kings and of his ‘works’ are a few broken fragments, a couple of legs and an inscription which commands the reader to despair. The poem, then, is about monuments, survival and the transience of even the greatest of us. But we might also notice that the poem is about readers and reading – the traveler reads a piece of writing, an inscription on the pedestal of a fragmented statue. The inscription commands the reader. And, rather differently, the word ‘read’ appears in line six, referring to the way that the sculptor understood the ‘passions’ of Ozymandias and was able to immortalize them in stone. Both the traveler and the sculptor are explicitly ﬁgured as readers, and we might also think about the ‘I’ of the ﬁrst line as another kind of reader –a listener to the traveler’s tale.
			  The poem, then, concerns a series of framed acts of reading. The sculptor reads the face of the king, the traveler reads the inscription, the narrative ‘I’ listens to the tale and, ﬁnally, we read the poem. One of the things that we might do with this poem is to think about these acts of reading. The poem can be thought about as what Paul de Man calls an ‘allegory of reading’ (de Man, 1979): it is not only a poem which can be read, it is also a poem about reading. One of the crucial questions of reading, for example, is how we can justify any particular reading: how can we tell if a particular reading or interpretation is valid? This is a question that goes to the heart of almost every debate in criticism and theory. In this respect the poem presents a paradox in that the traveler says that only a few fragments of the statue remain, that this is all that is left of Ozymandias and his great works. But if this is the case, how can the traveler know that the sculptor read the king’s passions ‘well’? In this way Shelley’s poem can be understood as telling a story or allegory about one of the central paradoxes of reading. To read ‘well’ is generally taken as meaning to read accurately or faithfully. But the question of which reading of a text is the most accurate is itself a question of reading.
		- 2.1.1
			- The poem "Ozymandias" by Percy Bysshe Shelley is about monuments, survival, and the transience of even the greatest of us. It is also about readers and reading, as the sculptor, the traveler, and the narrator are all depicted as readers. The poem can be seen as an allegory of reading, raising questions about how we can justify any particular reading and which reading is the most accurate. The poem presents a paradox in that the traveler knows the sculptor read the king's passions well, but if only a few fragments of the statue remain, how can this be known?
		- **2.2**
		  collapsed:: true
			- ‘Ozymandias’, then, opens up a series of questions concerning readers and reading. In addition to the crucial question of how we can validate any reading (how we can know whether it is true or faithful), the poem also engages with other questions. Who is this traveler who reads the inscription, for example? And who is the ‘I’ who listens to, or ‘reads’, his story? Is the sculptor’s ‘mocking’ of the king’s face a kind of reading? What do such questions lead us to think about the power relations of any reading? Is it in the king’s power to command his readers to despair? Or to make them obey? Is the traveler’s reading of the inscription different from how that inscription might have been read while the king was alive? And does reading there-fore change over time – is reading historically determined? What does all of this suggest about reading more generally? In this chapter we shall begin to explore some of these questions, referring to Shelley’s poem as a way of summarizing some important developments in literary criticism and theory of the last few decades.
			  Some of the most widely publicized developments in literary theory of the second half of the twentieth century went under the umbrella term reader-response criticism’. Such developments are usually understood as a reaction against Anglo-American ‘new criticism’ of the post-war period. Before we discuss reader-response criticism itself, then, it might be useful brieﬂy to outline the position of new criticism with regard to readers and reading. Associated with such US critics as Cleanth Brooks, W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley, and indebted also to the principles of ‘practical criticism’ associated with the British critics I.A. Richards and F.R. Leavis, new criticism involved a way of reading that emphasized form – the importance of considering ‘the words on the page’ – rather than factors such as the life of the author and his or her intentions, or the historical and ideological context in which the text was produced. New critics considered that such questions, while no doubt interesting, were irrelevant to a consideration of the text itself: they thought of literary texts as ‘autonomous’, as self-sufﬁcient and self-contained unities, as aesthetic objects made of words. Correspondingly, new critics argued that to try to take account of readers’ reactions or responses in the con-text of, for example, a poem, was to introduce an alien and fundamentally extraneous factor. They even invented a term for what they saw as the ‘error’ involved in talking about a reader’s response in discussions of literary texts: they called it the ‘affective fallacy’. For new critics, then, what was import-ant was to pay scrupulous attention to the words of texts themselves, thus bypassing the subjective impressionism of the reader’s response.
		- The poem "Ozymandias" raises questions about readers and reading, such as who is the traveler who reads the inscription and is the sculptor's mocking of the king's face a kind of reading? These questions lead to a discussion of the power relations of any reading and whether reading is historically determined. This chapter will explore some of these questions and reference developments in literary criticism and theory of the last few decades. One of these developments is reader-response criticism, which emerged as a reaction against new criticism's emphasis on form and autonomy of literary texts. New critics believed that readers' reactions or responses were irrelevant and even called it the "affective fallacy". Instead, they focused on the words of the text itself.
		- **2.3**

			- Like all critical movements, new criticism created its own special canon of literary works and authors. Shelley, notoriously, was not much in evidence in the new critical canon: in his inﬂuential book Revaluation (1936), F.R. Leavis had set the trend by caustically opining that Shelley was ‘almost unreadable’, and that the effect of his eloquence was ‘to hand poetry over to a sensibility that has no more dealings with intelligence than it can help’ (Leavis 1972, 171, 175). In his book The Romantic Poets, Graham Hough declared rather dismissively that ‘Ozymandias is an extremely clear and direct poem, advancing to a predetermined end by means of one ﬁrmly held image’ (Hough 1967, 142). Dismissing the poem in this way is odd in view of the fact that irony, ambiguity and paradox are key elements in the new critical weaponry of reading, and that all three are dramatically at stake in lines 10 and 11 of the poem, the inscription on the pedestal. ‘Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!’ is ironic, for example, from at least two perspectives. First, the line can be read as an example of ‘hubris’ or excessive pride on the part of Ozymandias, who is thus shown to be absurd. Second, it can be read as ironic from Ozymandias’s point of view: knowing that even he will die, Ozymandias inscribes these words for future generations, reminding us that even the greatest will be forgotten in time. These conﬂicting ironies produce both ambiguity and paradox – ambiguity concerning which reading is more valid, and paradox in the fact that the inscription appears to say two conﬂicting things.
			  Beginning in the late 1960s and becoming increasingly inﬂuential in the 1970s and early 1980s, reader-response criticism directly questioned the principles of new criticism. For critics and theorists such as Wolfgang Iser, Stanley Fish and Michael Riffaterre, questions of the literary text and its meaning(s) cannot be disengaged from the role that the reader takes. Although these and other reader-response critics have widely different approaches to literary texts, they all agree that the meaning of the text is created through the process of reading. What they object to in new criticism is the notion that a certain quality or ‘meaning’ of a literary text simply lies there in the text waiting for the reader or critic to come along and identify it. Graham Hough’s apparently objective assertion that ‘Ozymandias’ is ‘extremely clear and direct’, for ex-ample, elides the question of ‘to whom?’ Hough appears to generalize what is, in fact, his particular view of the poem. As we have tried to suggest, the poem may also be read very differently, as syntactically complex and semantically dense. The new critics’ sense that the meaning of a poem is simply there involves thinking of meaning (in Terry Eagleton’s memorable metaphor) as like a wisdom tooth, ‘waiting patiently to be extracted’ (Eagleton 1996, 77). Reacting against what we might characterize as the ‘dentistry’ school of criticism, reader-response critics recognize that the meanings of a text rely, in a dynamic way, on the work of the reader. Given that reading is a necessary dimension of any text, these critics attempt to plot the process of reading and the role of the reader.
		- New criticism created its own canon of literary works and authors, and Shelley was not much in evidence. However, the irony, ambiguity, and paradox in "Ozymandias" make it a suitable subject for new critical reading, despite dismissals by some critics. Reader-response criticism emerged in the late 1960s and challenged the principles of new criticism by recognizing that the meaning of a text is created through the process of reading and that the reader's role is crucial. The meanings of a text rely on the work of the reader, and reader-response critics attempt to plot the process of reading and the role of the reader.

			- Rather than closing down the questions of ‘who reads?’ and ‘what is reading?’, however, reader-response criticism has opened a postmodern Pandora’s box. Critics such as Norman Holland and David Bleich, for ex-ample, are interested in investigating ways in which particular individuals respond to texts, and with exploring ways in which such responses can be related to those individuals’ ‘identity themes’, to their personal psychic dis-positions – the individual character of their desires, needs, experiences, resistances and so on. This is often referred to as ‘subjective criticism’ or ‘personal criticism’. Such critics would not be interested in deciding which reading of line eleven of ‘Ozymandias’ is ‘correct’ because such correctness or accuracy is beside the point. Norman Holland, for example, argues that ‘interpretation is a function of identity’ and that ‘all of us, as we read, use the literary work to symbolize and ﬁnally to replicate ourselves’ (Holland 1980, 123, 124). To parody the logic of subjective criticism, we might suppose that a reader whose irregular potty-training has resulted in a pathological hatred of authority-ﬁgures will delight in the ironic treatment of the King of Kings in Shelley’s poem, while another reader who has early come to associate father-ﬁgures with absence and unreliability will see the poem as a poignant conﬁrmation of the inevitable disappearance of all fathers. Although Holland assures his reader that he is not ‘positing an isolated solipsistic self’ (Holland 1980, 131), this is precisely the danger that other critics have seen in this kind of criticism: such a reliance on the autonomy of the reader’s thoughts and feelings seems to lead to a state of delusion epitomized by Ozymandias’s hollow words.
			  Theorists such as Stanley Fish, on the other hand, argue that any individual reader is necessarily part of a ‘community’ of readers. Every reader, he suggests, reads according to the conventions of his or her ‘interpretive community’. In other words, an individual reader’s response, according to this model, is determined by the conventions of reading into which he or she has been educated within a particular socio-historical context. Our recognition of the equivocality of ‘Ozymandias’, for example, is determined by the fact that we have been taught to look and listen for ambiguity and polysemia in literary texts.
			  A third inﬂuential strand of reader-response criticism is exempliﬁed by the work of Wolfgang Iser. Iser elaborates ways in which the work of reading involves an interaction between elements of the text and the act of reading itself. He explores ways in which the text is ‘concretized’ – given shape or meaning in the act of reading. For Iser, neither the text nor the reader should be studied in isolation. Rather, the text produces certain ‘blanks’ or ‘gaps’ that the reader must attempt to complete: the reader ‘is drawn into the events and made to supply what is meant from what is not said’ (Iser 1995, 24). For Iser, the fact that we know nothing about the traveler in Shelley’s poem, for ex-ample, ‘spurs the reader into action’ (24). ‘Who is this traveler?’ we might ask. ‘What does he or she think about what is described in the poem?’ The text prompts us imaginatively to ﬁll in or ﬁll out such hermeneutic or interpretative ‘gaps’.
		- Reader-response criticism has opened up a postmodern Pandora's box, with different critics exploring the ways in which particular individuals respond to texts and how these responses can be related to personal psychic dispositions. This is known as subjective or personal criticism. Critics like Norman Holland argue that interpretation is a function of identity and that every reader uses the literary work to symbolize and replicate themselves. However, others see a danger in relying too heavily on the autonomy of the reader's thoughts and feelings. Stanley Fish argues that every reader is part of an interpretive community and reads according to the conventions of that community. Wolfgang Iser explores the ways in which the work of reading involves an interaction between elements of the text and the act of reading itself. For Iser, the text produces blanks or gaps that the reader must attempt to complete, spurring the reader into action.

			- During the 1980s and 1990s, the political dimensions of reading became increasingly central to critical debate. Literary texts have been read in terms of power relations, in accordance with Michel Foucault’s suggestion that ‘power is everywhere’ (Foucault 1981, 93) – even in reading. ‘Ozymandias’, in fact, produces multiple representations of the relationship between power and reading. Most explicitly there is the sculptor’s ‘reading’ of the power of the king.
			  The word ‘mocked’ means both ‘imitated’ or ‘copied’ and ‘ridiculed’ (a misrepresentation that represents more accurately or more cruelly). The commanding power of the king – his power, not least, to make the sculptor ‘read’ his face and to copy it on to stone – is resisted in that very reading, in that mockery. The sculptor’s ‘reading’ is both a copy, a faithful representation, and a reading which ridicules. Reading here is ﬁgured as both faithful, an action of subservience, and a subversive act of resistance to power, a transfer and trans-formation of power. Alternatively, we might consider ways in which the poem suggests that acts of reading are bound up in the historical speciﬁcity of power relations. The reading of the statue and the inscription, in this sense, changes over time. Someone contemporary with the King of Kings might read the commanding inscription – ‘Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!’ – as a statement of omnipotence. By contrast, a reader who, like the traveler, reads the inscription surrounded by the ‘lone and level sands’, by the absence of those works, their non-survival, can only read them ironically. What has remained, what has survived, is the work of the sculptor, the represented ‘passions’ of the king (itself a kind of reading), not his works. The power relations of text and reader have shifted decisively over time. Reading, in this sense, is not always and everywhere the same. As Robert Young comments, Shelley’s poem ‘demonstrates that meaning, like power, is not stable or ﬁxed, and that even power cannot guarantee a tyranny of meaning: although authors may have intentions when they write, once they have written they cannot control and ﬁx the meaning of any reading’ (Young 1991a, 238). Finally, we might extrapolate from this to think about the way in which any reading produces a certain relation of power. Shelley’s poem might itself be read as a kind of ‘cold command’ – a command to read. But any reading of the poem must constitute a form of resistance to such a command, a ‘mockery’ of that command, by the imposition or ‘stamping’ of its own interpretation on the poem. Reading survives the command of the text.
		- The passage explores how the act of reading is intertwined with power relations, and how "Ozymandias" can be read as a text that produces multiple representations of the relationship between power and reading. The sculptor's "reading" of the power of the king, for example, is both a faithful representation and a subversive act of resistance to power. Additionally, the poem suggests that the act of reading is historically determined and can change over time. What was once read as a statement of omnipotence by someone contemporary with the King of Kings is now read ironically by a reader surrounded by the "lone and level sands." Finally, the passage suggests that any reading produces a certain relation of power, and that reading survives the command of the text.

			- As part of this emphasis on power-relations, recent criticism has also given increased attention to questions of gender and race. Judith Fetterley, for ex-ample, has argued that female readers of classic US ﬁction (and, by implica-tion, of other literary texts) have been ‘emasculated’, by which she means that they have traditionally been taught to read ‘as men’ (Fetterley 1978). Writing in the late 1970s, Fetterley argues that women should begin to liberate themselves from the notion of a ‘universal’ reader (who is implicitly male) and from an identiﬁcation with male viewpoints in reading, and to develop speciﬁcally female models of reading. At stake here is, in Jonathan Culler’s terms, the question of what it would mean to read ‘as a woman’ (Culler 1983, 43–64): how might ‘reading as a woman’ be different from ‘reading as a man’? 
			  And do we know what it means to read ‘as a man’? It might be possible to think about Shelley’s poem in terms of gendered reading. If we can assume that the traveler is male (after all, few solitary European travelers were female in the early nineteenth century), then one can see that the poem is not only about male pride, but also about male reading. The poem, indeed, is overwhelmingly masculine, a text from which women have been excluded. Yet few critics have been troubled by questions of sexual difference in relation to ‘Ozymandias’: in this respect, we might suggest, the critical response has been ‘emasculated’. From Fetterley’s perspective, we might ask how a non-emasculated reading would respond to the masculine power-play of Shelley’s poem.
			  Critics concerned with questions of race and ethnicity have also developed speciﬁc strategies of reading and talking about reading. Theorists such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Henry Louis Gates Jr and Edward Said, for example, have transformed the nature of contemporary literary studies through their emphasis on questions of colonization, ethnic difference, racial oppression and discrimination, the position of the subaltern, the West and its construction of the ‘other’, imperialism and Orientalism. Edward Said, for instance, argues for what he calls ‘contrapuntal reading’ whereby, in reading a text, one ‘open[s] it out both to what went into it and to what its author excluded’ (Said 1993, 79). Our reading of Jane Eyre in terms of race and slavery in Chapter 24 suggests one such ‘contrapuntal’ reading. Similarly, Henry Louis Gates makes questions of reading central to black literary criticism and theory when he argues that black people in the United States have had to develop particular strategies of reading and interpretation for survival: Black people have always been masters of the ﬁgurative: saying one thing to mean something quite other has been basic to black survival in oppressive Western cultures. Misreading signs could be, and indeed often was, fatal. ‘Reading’, in this sense, was not play; it was an essential aspect of the ‘literacy’ training of a child. (Gates 1984, 6)
		- The phrase "contrapuntal reading" is used by Edward Said to refer to a method of reading that involves opening a text to both what went into it and what the author excluded. This method is useful in reading texts that deal with questions of colonization, ethnic difference, racial oppression and discrimination, the position of the subaltern, the West and its construction of the "other," imperialism, and Orientalism. Similarly, Henry Louis Gates Jr. argues that black people in the United States have had to develop particular strategies of reading and interpretation for survival. According to Gates, black people have always been masters of the figurative and reading has been an essential aspect of the "literacy" training of a child. Black people have developed particular strategies of reading and interpretation that involve saying one thing to mean something quite other, and these strategies have been crucial for their survival in oppressive Western cultures.

			- A reading concerned with questions of race might start from the fact that this English poem deals with a racial other – Egyptian or African – and explore the way in which such otherness is inscribed in the poem. The fact that the land is referred to as ‘antique’, for example, entirely effaces any possibility of a contemporary civilization and culture there. There is nothing beside the barrenness of the ‘lone and level sands’. For this poem, Africa apparently only signiﬁes in terms of a mythical past.
			  The recent emergence of ecocriticism has allowed for important new ways of reading such a poem (see Chapter 16, below). From this perspective, 
			  ‘Ozymandias’ is concerned with the relationship between the human, speciﬁcally in this case an ancient human culture, and the environment. Once you think of the poem in this context, its force immediately alters. It is no longer a poem only about the relationships between people – the pharaoh, the sculptor, the traveler, the speaker and his addressee, the poet, the reader –but also about the effect that a civilization has had on its environment, on what is now the wasted landscape so poignantly described. According to such a reading, Shelley’s poem would be understood to respond to the ecological destruction caused by monumental human arrogance. This desolate land-scape (‘boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away’) can be seen not as ‘natural’ but as having been produced by human intervention (perhaps by over-cultivation, or through the redirection of water for irrigation or by other geo-engineering endeavors). After all, we can safely assume that in Ozymandias’s time, the land surrounding the statue was able to sustain the life that this poem represents only in its absence. An ecocritical reading would pay attention not only to the poem’s engagement with political and aesthetic questions, then, but also to the wider ramiﬁcations of its stark analysis of the eco-destruction that has typiﬁed human ‘civilization’ down the ages.
		- An ecocritical reading of "Ozymandias" would focus on the relationship between human civilization and the environment, specifically in terms of the ecological destruction caused by human arrogance. This reading would suggest that the barren landscape described in the poem was not a natural state but rather a result of human intervention such as over-cultivation or the redirection of water for irrigation. The poem would be seen as a response to the devastating impact of human civilization on the environment. This reading would shift the focus of the poem from its engagement with political and aesthetic questions to the wider ramifications of its analysis of eco-destruction.

			- Finally, a poststructuralist or deconstructive reading of ‘Ozymandias’ might, in addition to these concerns, trace the dispersal or dissolution of the reader’s identity in the act of reading and question the very possibility of interpretive mastery. For poststructuralists, there is a dynamic signiﬁcance in the question of which comes ﬁrst – the text or the reader? Is reading simply something that happens to a text as if by chance, something which leaves a text fundamentally unaltered? If so, then the role of the reader would appear to be determined by the text itself: each literary text would be like a set of instructions, a kind of recipe, for how it should be read. By contrast, the text may be understood as fundamentally incomplete, to be effected in the act of reading. In this case the text is remade in every reading. Rather than choosing between these two hypotheses, deconstructive theories of reading argue that both models are operative, in a peculiar double bind of reading: the reader makes the text and the text makes the reader. Deconstruction explores the space between these two possibilities and it seeks to highlight ways in which every reading and every text is unpredictable. Thus deconstruction is interested in the fact that while any text demands a ‘faithful’ reading, it also demands an individual response. Put differently, reading is at once singular (yours and nobody else’s) and general (conforming to patterns of meaning dictated by the text – a text that does not require you in order to function). Through analysis of these and other paradoxes, critics such as Paul de Man and J. Hillis Miller suggest ways in which reading is strange, unsettling, even ‘impossible’.
		- In a poststructuralist or deconstructive reading of "Ozymandias," the emphasis is on the instability of meaning and the dissolution of the reader's identity in the act of reading. This approach questions the possibility of interpretive mastery and explores the dynamic relationship between the text and the reader. According to deconstructive theories, the text may be understood as fundamentally incomplete and remade in every reading. This double bind of reading highlights the unpredictability of every reading and the paradoxical nature of the reader's relationship to the text. Deconstruction, through the analysis of paradoxes, seeks to show that reading is strange, unsettling, and even "impossible."

			- How should we read the word ‘appear’ in line nine of Shelley’s poem (‘And on the pedestal, these words appear’), for example? What makes these words appear? The word ‘appear’ might be shown to challenge all conventional preconceptions concerning reading. In particular, it challenges us to rethink the relationship between a text on the one hand simply appearing, simply being there like a monument, to be read, appearing from nowhere, and on the other hand a text appearing in the sense of ‘seeming’, an apparition, made in reading. Is the text there, or do we make it appear, do we imagine it? Jacques Derrida has referred to the delirium of reading, a pun or ‘portmanteau’ word which combines the French ‘lire’ (‘to read’) with ‘delirium’, to suggest ways in which reading can be delirious or hallucinatory (Derrida 1979, 94, quoting Blanchot). Just as we can never know how ‘well’, how accurately or faithfully the sculptor has read the king’s passions, neither can we escape the dynamics of reading and delirium. In short, we can never stop reading because we can never ﬁnally know if what ‘appears’ in this poem is us reading or us being read. This is not to suggest we should therefore give up, either in despair or in indifference. Our very lives and identities are at stake. If, as we have argued, ‘Ozymandias’ is as much about readers and reading as about anything else, then we might see that the relation between reading and being read is strangely twisted: not only do we read the poem but the poem reads us. Like Ozymandias himself, we are fragmented, mute and transient: our ‘passions’ are read, and perhaps mocked, by the sculptor, in the form of the poem itself. After all, in reading this poem, we perhaps cannot avoid a ventriloquist's articulation, silent or not, of the king’s words – My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings, Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! How do you read that? What happens to you, to your name?
		- The word ‘appear’ in line nine of Shelley’s poem can be read in multiple ways, challenging conventional preconceptions about reading.
