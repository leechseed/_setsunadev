- # CONSTRUCTING DUALISTIC THEMES
	- *To create a theme, you must create a dilemma.*
	- *Duality is essential to creating a good dilemma.*
	- Duality is two concepts that are equal, opposite, and valid.
	- eg:
		- Law and Virtue
		- Pride and Guilt
		- Sacrifice and Privilege
		- Domination and Submission
		- Purpose and Potential
		- Safety and Freedom
		- Purity and Power
		- Luck and Prayer
		- Desire and Need
	- Dualistic Dilemmas must easily be expressed within the culture and society of the designer.
	- An easy test would be to propose the idea of 'law and virtue' to an individual or group.
		- If conversation is provoked then its probably pretty good.
		- If there is a group of people and tribes form along the lines of of the dilemma, its really good.
	- It is imperative to present the dilemma as a *pair* and not a *choice.*
	- Two parts of a whole as opposed to one or the other.
	- Dualistic Dilemmas specifically use the contraction: *and*.
		- ~~but, or, though, shit, dookie~~
- # THEMATIC CHARACTER DESIGN
	- *Physical and Surface Attributes for Tragic Personality are Thematic Traits in Opposition.*
	- **Isolated and Popular**
	- **Brave and Cowardly**
	- **Strong and Weak**
	- **Sexy and Ugly**
	- **Powerful and Impotent**
	- **Protective and Neglectful**
	- **Intelligent and Stupid**
	-
	- *Characters express their personality by navigating through time.*
	- *One attribute is consistently expressed through their actions, thoughts, and interactions.*
	- The *secondary attribute* is expressed sparingly.
	- It is *required* that this secondary attribute is expressed in *key events* or *decisions*.
	- These key events or decisions occur during the *beginning and end* of plot design models.
		- eg: chapter transitions, sequence transitions, arc transitions, etc.
	- The effect of *tragic personality* is to convey an *imperfect yet relatable person.*
	-
	- Tragic personalities, at some point in the story, must be *believable* to be accepted by the audience.
	- Believability is created through *evidence*.
	- Evidence is created through *thematic dilemmas* experienced by the character.
