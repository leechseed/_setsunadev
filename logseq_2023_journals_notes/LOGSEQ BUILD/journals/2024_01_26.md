- # PRODUCT INFORMATION 
  
  High-quality Direct Box from Radial!
  The Radial ProDI is a high-quality, passive mono direct box that's perfect for use with acoustic guitars, bass guitars, electric pianos, and synthesizers. The ProDI's custom transformer helps to deliver the highest performance possible, virtually eliminating issues with noise. And, as with all Radial DI boxes, the ProDI is incredibly reliable and easy to use — just plug in your mono instrument and instantly eliminate ground loops, while enjoying a rich, full sound. If you need the same excellent quality in a stereo version, Radial also offers the ProD2 stereo version.
  
  Raidal ProDI Passive Mono Direct Box at a Glance:
  
    Full-range passive direct box
    Custom isolation transformer eliminates noise
    Really easy to use
    Built like a tank
  
  Passive vs. Active DI
  The Radial ProDI and ProD2 (stereo version) are full-range passive direct boxes. Active direct boxes employ electronic circuits to change the impedance from hi-Z to lo-Z and balance the signal. Passive DIs instead employ a simple passive transformer to do the work. Active DIs require batteries, 48V phantom-power or external power supplies to power their circuits, while passive transformer-equipped direct boxes do not require any power to perform their task. The advantage of a transformer over typical active circuits can be summarized as "a great device to reduce system noise" in a sound system. To accomplish the task of noise elimination, the Radial ProDI and ProD2 features first-class transformers and require no batteries or power supply.
  
  Custom Isolation Transformer
  The Radial ProDI is equipped with a custom-made audio transformer, which provides exceptional signal handling without saturation. More importantly, the ProDI's custom transformer has extremely low phase distortion in the critical bass and mid regions. The ProDI's transformer provides 100% isolation, to eliminate hum- and noise-causing ground loops, while maintaining signal integrity. Inside the ProDI you'll also find isolated XLR connectors, to eliminate chassis ground potential, as well as a military-spec PC board, with a full surface ground plane to reduce susceptibility to RF noise. The result is exceptional clarity and definition, at an attractive price point.
  
  Really Easy to Use
  The best feature of the ProDI is "plug and play" ease of use. All you do is connect the instrument to the 1/4" inputs, the 1/4" through jack to the stage amplifier(s) or mixer and the XLR output to the mixing console and you are done. Any distortion? Hit the -15dB pad. Any noise? Just depress the ground lift switch. You will find that with acoustic guitars and basses, the natural tone of the instrument will shine through with a smooth and musical rendering. For electrically powered devices, such as keyboards, the ProDI will immediately eliminate troublesome ground loops while delivering solid dynamics, with a full rich sound.
  
  Solid Construction
  Look inside a ProDI and you'll find the build quality and components to be of only the highest professional standards. Radial's proven construction methods and materials ensure years of trouble-free service — able to withstand the rigors of the most demanding, high-use professional environments. Radial pioneered the use of its innovative "book cover" design, which provides a protective zone around the switches and connectors that keep the components safe. The 14-gauge welded I-beam inner chassis and 14-gauge outer shell found in the ProD2 and ProDI greatly reduce the possibility of torque stresses being applied to the PC board. Stress on circuit boards causes broken and intermittent solder joints, a common cause of failure in commercial rental and other high-use environments. A full bottom no-slip rubber pad works double-duty by providing protection from electrical shock and making sure these DI's stay put.

  Love Radial Products
  I have been using Radial DI's as far as I can remember. This one replaced the cheap DI box for the keyboard at church. We had loud hums, loud buzzes and could not figure it out until we replaced the DI. I would not settle for any other DI box but Radial. All problems were... read more

- # Here's more data from Radial Engineering's official website
  
  Passive Direct Box
  
  The ProDI is a passive direct box designed for use on stage or in home recording studios, with the ability to handle high output instruments without distortion, and a transformer-isolated output to eliminate noise from ground loops.
  
  
  World class DI
  
  The heart of the ProDI is a custom wound Radial transformer. It features an exceptionally high 140kΩ input impedance to reduce loading while enabling the ProDI to handle extreme signal levels at all frequencies without distortion. This is further improved upon with an internal MuMETAL® shield to protect against electromagnetic fields that can cause unshielded transformers to distort.
  
  
  ProDI with electric bass
  
  The ProDI works great for high output devices like active bass guitars. It's able to handle the huge signal levels from active pickups without distortion and the transformer isolation prevents ground loop hum. The ProDI sends the pure sound of the bass to the PA and to the player's amp.
  
  
  ProDI with acoustic guitar
  
  Acoustic guitars can sometimes have sharp sounding active preamps. The ProDI naturally smoothes out the transients for a warmer tone. And because the ProDI is able to handle loud signals from active pickups, it will not distort. This makes it a great direct box for acoustic guitars.
  
  ProDI with a keyboard
  
  Today's digital keyboards are not only very dynamic, they also have a tremendous range from low to high notes. The ProDI is able to withstand excessive signal levels at all frequencies without introducing distortion or phase shift, so all your patches sound great.
