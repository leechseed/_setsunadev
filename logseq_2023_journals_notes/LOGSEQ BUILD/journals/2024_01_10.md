		   ### 9. Between Tangled Roots
		  
		  *Rageful spirits provoke a dragon to go on a deadly rampage* (Level 10)
		  
		  ![](https://i0.wp.com/www.hipstersanddragons.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/between-tangled-roots-radiant-citadel.jpeg?resize=629%2C354&ssl=1)
		  
		  *Between Tangled Roots* offers *Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel* its first monster hunt: for a [**bakunawa** dragon](https://www.aswangproject.com/bakunawa/) that has gone berserk and is attacking local settlements (which once it would have protected).
		  
		  The setting is [inspired by the Philippines](https://dnd.wizards.com/news/between-tangled-roots-pam-punzalan)
		  and made instantly memorable by the introduction of skybridges that 
		  link the various isles of the archipelago. A huge bridge could make for a
		  rather boring travel environment but there’s some excellent lore behind
		  them, some great encounters included, plus some inspiring artwork that 
		  helps us imagine their sinuous forms snaking through the sky.
		  
		  Back to the monster hunt and the author has given [this common D&D quest type](https://www.hipstersanddragons.com/types-of-rpg-quests/)
		  a couple of additional layers. Firstly, the quest-givers hire the 
		  characters to “bring it [the dragon] peace”, leaving it somewhat 
		  ambiguous whether they should kill, or somehow save, the monster in 
		  question. Secondly, there is a (potentially rival) group of dragon 
		  hunters also seeking out the bakunawa, who are less ambiguous about 
		  their aims – they wish to slay the monster that they feel betrayed their
		  settlement many moons ago.
		  
		  So far so good, and once over the skybridge, the travel through the 
		  blighted island of Lambakluha feels atmospheric and well thought out. 
		  The final boss battle also promises to be interesting, at least if the 
		  party try to de-corrupt the dragon instead of killing it. This way they 
		  will have to try and destroy the spirit blisters pumping the bakunawa 
		  full of negative energy, while the beast fights to protect them. DMs can
		  use the rival party of dragon hunters as a complication in the combat, 
		  or perhaps a potential *deus ex machina* to prevent a TPK.
		  
		  As for flaws, the author sometimes plucks for what’s convenient, 
		  rather than what’s credible, including sometimes shuffling players 
		  towards a predetermined scene or outcome. I also don’t think there was 
		  any need to stick a PG rating on the dragon attack at the start of the 
		  adventure, which miraculously doesn’t kill anyone.
		  
		  The Dayawlongon Gazetteer builds a picture of a story-telling, family-orientated society that (mostly) pay their soul debts.
		  
		  **Hipster Remix:** I was disappointed by the undead 
		  attack on The Final Steps of Courage military camp, where “whether the 
		  characters are near the gate or elsewhere, three wraiths… close in on 
		  the characters and attack.” I guess the author’s intention was to break 
		  off a manageable slice of the combat for the players to deal with, 
		  without having to worry about the NPCs etc., but it comes across as a 
		  bit too convenient. I would do my best to turn this story beat into an 
		  epic ‘[Massacre at Hardhome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTVbeWD74W0&ab_channel=MagazineHD)‘
		  style scene, whereby the camp is assaulted and the players have a 
		  chance to show off their horde-breaking skills, joining the fray with 
		  the soldiers (if they choose to! As written the players aren’t given any
		  agency). Given the corrupted nature of the island, twig, needle and 
		  vine blights would make for thematic allies to accompany a dozen or so 
		  wraiths (or maybe some more corporeal undead) at the gates.
		  
		  While I enjoyed the introduction of the rival monster hunters as a 
		  tool for the DM, it’s a bit off-putting that if the players choose to 
		  head several miles off course to explore the Zenith of Sorrow before 
		  heading to the dragon’s lair, they only end up losing a few rounds on 
		  their rivals. I’d be tempted to introduce a real ticking clock here. 
		  What if, when the party sit down with the soldiers, after the camp 
		  assault, they learn that a party of dragon hunters set off into the 
		  swamp some 8 hours previously? (Note: we still introduce Paolo and his 
		  crew to the party in Kalapang [in the Root & Roost tavern would be 
		  better than on the skybridge], but these dragon hunters either set their
		  alarm earlier than the PCs, or used *windwalk* etc. to get 
		  ahead). Now the party know they can’t hang around if they want to get to
		  the dragon first… giving them a dilemma over whether to rest (they may 
		  have burned a lot of resources in the camp assault) or investigate 
		  Sorrow’s Zenith, or simply press ahead. You can then run some kind of 
		  progress check for the rival party, who may suffer significant delays 
		  themselves. (Note: the adventure states that the swamp and overgrown 
		  hills are difficult terrain but gives journey time of one day to travel 
		  24 miles. That should read 12 miles, as 24 miles per day is the amount 
		  travelled over normal terrain [p.182, PH]. On the other hand, on the map
		  the distances look half of that stated in the text. As the DM, you can 
		  fix the distances to suit how much travel you want to include in the 
		  adventure!)
