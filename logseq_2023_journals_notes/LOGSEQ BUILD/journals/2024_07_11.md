- I'm 8 and got an A-. A bit disappointed to be honest. How the heck is 
  #15A: -5?!?!? THE PEOPLE DESERVE AN ANSWER. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW 
  WHY. IS THAT YOU GOD? HAVE YOU FORSAKEN US WITH YOUR WICKED WICKED  
  TRICKS? YOU THINK THIS IS JUST A GAME? I'M MERELY AN EVEN-AGED CHILD 
  STUCK BETWEEN A PRIME AND A NINE. 
  
  N E G A T I V E F I V E. #15 confonds me.
- Also, why can't I review the results and see which ones I answered 
  correctly or not? How are the questions weighted? If the average 
  test-taking time is 15 minutes, and I spent over an hour, does that 
  affect the validity of the test? I've taken one test before, does that 
  mean I'm still as smart as Thomas Jefferson at my age (accounting for 
  brain inflation and that math wasn't invented yet of course) You have my
  birthday and email but you can't give me the results of my test? What? 
  Bro you can email me, that's fine, especially if you give me my test 
  back. Like, I mean, it can't be that hard.
- Or is it like a philosophical position? As in, if we give the answers 
  back to each of the seven million people that would be seven million 
  email addresses in a database that can be queried based on a decent 
  amount of parameters. I mean signing up through Google hooks you up to 
  the matrix and it doesn't matter if you email us or not man, you've 
  straight-finger punched me in the chest and the liquid metal feels cold 
  and I'm scared. But I'm also wondering about #15. Cause I got that one 
  wrong. Can't remember the rest.
  Anyways, time-traveling 8-year-old Thomas Jefferson here to say, you did
  alright kid. I'm sure the valuation on that sweet sweet email db is one
  heckuva asset. Should lever heavy with it and pump EA. Madden 25 is 
  gonna be terrible but damn, check that list, clock the scores of males 
  15-35 scoring under 110. That's a lot of football, my friend. That's the
  secret man. That's the formula, baby. It's that simple. John Madden and
  Soccer. Don't need an A- IQ to make a buck in this economy. Just gotta 
  know how to count yardage baby. We're on the 1-yard line fellas. Can you
  count? One, Two, TEN! WHERE ARE MY RUNNING BACKS? WHERE ARE MY RUNNING 
  BACKS? LETS GO EAT A SNACK.
