- # poker tournament
- For brand new players, I would never use 8/8/x starting stacks.  New 
  players play too many hands and limp a lot - you need more small denom 
  chips to avoid slowing the game down.  My “new player” set (for 
  kids/nephews/non-poker friends etc), is T5 base, which makes it “feel” 
  lower stakes.  I like 15/13/11/1 (5/25/100/500) for a 2k starting stack,
   but honestly wouldn’t be opposed to 20/20/14 (5/25/100).
