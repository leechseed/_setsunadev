## ARC 1
## THE LUNAR FRONTIER 

The narrative unfolds with the launch of a devastating movement known as the Free Moon Crusade. Mayari and her family, leading an idyllic life as frontier farmers, are abruptly thrust into chaos when news of the crusade reaches them. Compelled by a sense of duty, her brother, Yesac,  enlists in the cause. However, the crusade, under the guise of liberation, perpetrates widespread violence. A force of 60,000, driven by a destructive fervor, ravages communities, including Mayari's, leaving her to witness the murder of her family and the destruction of her home.

In the aftermath, Mayari finds herself in a disorienting haze of substance abuse and vice in the Spire, a vast super colony on the moon, a stark departure from her former life. She spirals into a life marred by crime, addiction, and exploitation, meeting Akali, a fellow sufferer who mirrors Mayari's fall from grace yet contrasts sharply in character.

The narrative takes a dramatic turn with the rise of Zaku the Prophet, who incites the city's disenfranchised with promises of a new crusade. This movement, ostensibly aimed at reclaiming the cosmodrome for a collective future, ignites a wave of violence among the impoverished working class. Caught in the fervor, Mayari's actions during a looting spree lead to her capture by the city's privatized security forces, marking the beginning of a new chapter of her life.

Condemned to a panopticon-style prison for her actions, Mayari's unruly behavior results in her transfer to a reformative institution, the Church of Earth. This establishment, linked to the very forces that destroyed her past, offers her a path to redemption through an ultimatum: absolve her sins through forgiveness or face death. It is here that she reunites with Akali, and together, they are transformed into a formidable pair serving the Church's militant objectives.

This arc symbolizes Mayari's journey through despair, resilience, and the quest for redemption, set against a backdrop of societal upheaval and personal transformation.

## ARC 2
## THE CHURCH OF EARTH

Mayari and Akali are thrust into a harsh educational regimen within the confines of a school operated by the Church of Earth. This institution, rooted in a distorted interpretation of Protestant beliefs, venerates the heroes and principles of a bygone America. Within this environment, children are organized into groups called centuries, each consisting of 100 individuals. Here, they undergo rigorous training, indoctrination, and punishment, with survival hinging on their ability to embrace and submit to the school's teachings.

Throughout this ordeal, Akali and Mayari forge a bond, vowing to support each other in their quest for survival. Yet, their alliance is tested by actions that sow doubt and mistrust between them. Communication breaks down as Mayari harbors unspoken grievances, leading to a tragic series of events that culminates in both nearly causing the other's demise.

A moment of reckoning comes when they confess their struggles to the school's administrators. This leads to a trial by combat, where they are pitted against each other in a fight to the death. In a pivotal moment, Akali overpowers Mayari but chooses mercy over obedience, sparing her life. This act of defiance, while sealing their acceptance of a shared fate, instead showcases their exceptional abilities when they are forced to confront and ultimately defeat a rival group of children in the ring.

Recognized for their talents but deemed uncontrollable, the sisters are segregated from their peers and enrolled in a special forces program aimed at infiltrating the cosmodrome. Despite their advancement, they are not exempt from punishment. They witness the horrifying ritual of decimation, where one child, selected by lot, is brutally executed by their peers—a grim reminder of the consequences of dissent, which leaves Akali profoundly disturbed.

Faced with the relentless brutality of their reality, Akali makes a decisive break from Mayari, opting to become a Centurion and lead others into battle. Despite Mayari's attempts to sway her, Akali's decision is irrevocable. Left to forge her own path, Mayari assumes the role of an Arbiter, embarking on a solitary journey marked by duty and the specter of past betrayals.

## ARC 3
## THE SOVIET PROTESTANTS 

Following a significant leap in time, Mayari finds herself in a life markedly similar to her early years, now commonly addressed as 'Ari' instead of May. She leads an unremarkable existence as a magnet fisher in the cosmodrome, a stark contrast to her tumultuous past. Together with her friends, she operates a solar-boat, reminiscent of old Earth's yachts, utilizing magnet fishing lines to collect debris in the moon's low atmosphere, dispatched by space cowboys known as moonboys.

In this seemingly serene life, she embarks on a romantic journey with the solar-boat's captain, known affectionately as Two-strikes. Their shared ambition is to excel in magnet fishing, aspiring to one day join the ranks of the moonboys, a role filled with danger and excitement.

This peaceful existence is disrupted during a mandatory pause in work to witness the public arrest and parade of Zaku, the defeated leader of the second crusade, along with his followers. A brief but intense eye contact with Zaku triggers a painful blackout in Mayari, signaling the resurgence of her turbulent past.

Mayari's life spirals once again following another blackout, during which she discovers a significant scar across her body, sparking flashbacks and memories of a hidden past. Overwhelmed by confusion and seeking escape, she turns to drugs, finding fleeting solace but further alienating herself from reality.

Two-strikes, unable to comprehend Mayari's turmoil, chooses to join her in this self-destructive spiral. Their lives become a chaotic blend of daytime duties on the solar-boat and nighttime indulgences in a psychedelic world of excess. Their neglect of responsibilities leads to disaster when their ship crashes, and in the aftermath, Mayari's dual identity as the Arbiter is triggered by the sight of the full Earth.

Abandoned and feeling betrayed, Two-strikes dedicates himself to the cosmos, while Mayari is transported into a vivid memory that feels all too real. She is reunited with her brother, who fills her with pride and hints at a grand purpose linked to her suffering and her role as the Arbiter.

Mayari uncovers that she orchestrated a complex plan involving Two-strikes and his crew to capture Zaku, leading to a dramatic confrontation that ends with her seizing Zaku and attempting an audacious escape. However, their flight is cut short by a blast from an orbital cannon, crashing them into a lunar cave.

In this cave, Mayari battles both the Arbiter suit and her internal demons, culminating in a confrontation with Zaku that forces her to question the essence of her struggle. In a moment of revelation, she realizes her fight has always been with herself, not with the teachings of the Church or Zaku.

The climactic scene reveals Zaku to be a sophisticated android, blurring the lines between reality and illusion for Mayari. As she succumbs to laughter and unconsciousness, her story closes on a note of ambiguity, leaving her—and the reader—questioning the nature of reality and the constructs of her mind.

## ARC 4
## THE MONKES 

Mayari finds herself unconscious in an underground geo-front, illuminated by a shaft of light from above. Nearby, the inert form of Zaku's Spine shows signs of life with occasional twitches. A group of apes, led by a commanding silverback gorilla, discovers her. Following the gorilla's orders, they craft a stretcher and transport Mayari into the depths of their domain, navigating through dark, cramped tunnels illuminated by technologically advanced devices.

These apes are enhanced with artificial spines and exo-arms connected to military vests, indicating a high level of technological integration. Their journey leads them across a bridge spanning a canyon with a lava river below, appearing strangely static as if frozen in time. Entering a vast boulevard, they are met by the curious and raucous attention of thousands of their kin.

As Mayari regains consciousness amidst the chaos, an ape gently silences her and places a breathing device on her, before she slips back into unconsciousness. She awakens in a virtual world, greeted by an ape named Middle Pizzabrickovensmif, or Pizza for short, who introduces her to this digital environment and reveals his identity as a species of intelligent, fluffy brown ape originally from China and brought to the moon by ancient humans.

Pizza explains the existence of 'the bunkers,' a society of intelligent apes, and suggests Mayari might assist them with a problem. However, their relationship becomes strained to the point of toxicity, leading Mayari to isolation in the simulation. Eventually, Pizza brings her to the Grand Chamber to perform tests, but she fails, leading to a sentence of death for both.

In a desperate struggle, Mayari fights back but is overpowered by a silverback. At the brink of defeat, a dramatic pause in the simulation reveals Pizza's recognition of Mayari's resilience, dubbing her a "Demon." Despite this acknowledgment, Mayari finds herself in a state of defeat and despair, believing she's trapped in purgatory as punishment for her betrayals.

Pizza, showing a flicker of empathy, attempts a different approach by introducing her to real ape society, but it's revealed to be a ruse for assassination. A sudden crisis interrupts the execution, and Pizza attempts suicide, but is stopped by an external catastrophe.

As Mayari attempts to end her own life, her aim is thrown off by an explosion, revealing a giant robot, Eva Unit 01, engaging in a battle with the ape forces. Zaku, now revealed to be inside the Eva, recognizes Mayari's voice, leading to a confrontation halted by an energy field around Mayari, protecting her from harm.

In the aftermath, as Mayari touches the protective field and observes her healing cheek, she questions Pizza about the event, only to learn that this unfolding scenario is beyond his control. This surreal twist leaves Mayari in a state of wonder and confusion, surrounded by the chaos of a world that defies her understanding.

## ARC 5
## THE SOCIETIES OF THE MOON 

Mayari indulges in the newfound freedom afforded by her "zorb," an AT-field she whimsically dubs as such, testing its limits while savoring a sense of liberation she's never experienced before. Her control over the zorb is mostly voluntary, though it occasionally activates on its own, sparking her curiosity.

She wanders the moon's varied landscapes, exploring cities, towns, and districts, immersing herself in diverse cultures, indulging in culinary delights, and partaking in refined forms of her past indulgences. During one poignant moment at the boundary of the moon's dark and light sides with a lover, she is struck by their naive curiosity about darkness, a reminder of her own painful past that such innocence has yet to encounter.

Another encounter exposes the divide between her empathetic nature and her lover's detachment when faced with the plight of homeless children, further straining their relationship. A night of supposed revelry in a club leaves Mayari disenchanted, her boredom with ecstasy and detachment from her lover becoming apparent.

Reflecting atop a city roof, Mayari discards a cigarette in a moment of contemplation before journeying to her ancestral home, now a village of moon silt harvesters. Her generosity to the rickshaw driver and her attempt to connect with the villagers through a photograph of her family bridge the gap between her past and present.

An old woman reveals the remnants of Mayari's childhood home, prompting her to craft a meaningful symbol from the wreckage—a gesture that ties her personal history to her experiences among the apes.

The village's tranquility is shattered by the arrival of a thousand crusaders, leading to a harrowing sequence where Mayari, initially hiding, intervenes to protect a family from the cruel actions of the knight Pisstopher and his men. Her intervention showcases the struggle with revealing her powers but ultimately marks a decisive moment where she stands against the oppressors.

Mayari challenges Pisstopher to a duel, asserting her identity as the Arbiter and setting the terms for the safety of the village and its surroundings. Despite the disbelief and scorn from the crusaders, she remains undaunted.

In a dramatic confrontation, Mayari withstands Pisstopher's onslaught, unharmed by his firepower, and counterattacks, leading to his defeat and the salvation of the village. Her actions, perceived as miraculous by the villagers and crusaders alike, elevate her to a saintly status, unknowingly embarking her on a path toward becoming a messiah. This transformation from a solitary wanderer to a figure of spiritual significance marks a pivotal turn in Mayari's journey, redefining her role on the moon and her legacy among its inhabitants.

## ARC 6 
## THE NEW KNIGHTS 

In a familiar scene with a significant twist, a group of crusaders approaches a small town under the banner of "xtx," a symbol representing Mayari's Crusade, signifying a crucifix in a cycle of falling and rising. The town, plagued by famine and sickness due to malfunctioning food processors and a lack of resources, offers what little they have to the approaching knights, seeking mercy and assistance.

Among the knights is Mayari, disguised and observing. When a desperate mother pleads for help for her child, suffering from a mysterious affliction marked by glowing circuits interfacing with the child's veins, Mayari's curiosity is piqued. Despite one knight's call for destruction, labeling the child a beast of the underworld, Mayari intervenes, seeking understanding rather than condemnation.

The townspeople's situation is dire, with Mayari quickly deducing their plight stems from their elders' desperation, having made contact with a malevolent race below the moon's surface, leading to the town's poisoning. The revelation stirs panic and despair among the townspeople, who view Mayari's diagnosis as a condemnation.

In the midst of crisis, Mayari, recognized as a messiah, deliberates with her knights, Steve and Fortune, on their course of action. Despite initial resistance, Mayari's leadership steers them towards compassion, aligning with ancient texts' guidance over the Church of Earth's lack thereof. She orders the preparation for the evacuation of civilians, intending to offer them a chance to contribute to their crusade in exchange for refuge, while the marked, including the afflicted child, are to stay behind.

As the townspeople join the crusaders, a calculated decision is made to destroy the town and its underground connections to the malevolent race, using artillery to collapse the mines and cut off potential threats. Observing from a distance, Mayari sets their sights on Telusi, the capital of the sector, planning their journey and ensuring the sustenance of her people through intercepted orbital cargo.

Mayari's journey is marked by difficult decisions, balancing mercy with the harsh realities of leadership and the ongoing struggle against unseen enemies beneath the moon's surface. Her response to the townspeople's plight and the strategic destruction of the town underscores the complexities of her crusade, one that blends benevolence with the brutal necessities of survival in a hostile world.

## ARC 7
## THE LIBERATION OF TELUSI 

After a grueling day of negotiations and strategic planning, Mayari convenes with the trade council of Telusi to finalize arrangements for the garrisoning of the city and address pressing logistical concerns. The atmosphere is tense yet focused as they deliberate on crucial decisions that could shape the future of their operations.

Steve, ever the strategic thinker, proposes garrisoning the troops near the dockyard to alleviate congestion caused by a cargo yacht blockage, thus ensuring smooth processing of the trade network. Fortune, with her unparalleled leadership skills, pledges to assist the police force in containing a rebellion among unionized stevedores before it spreads further.

In a bold move, Mayari asserts her plan to lead her elite special forces warriors, the Templars, in a raid on the headquarters of the rebellion. Suspicions linger regarding the Church of Earth's potential involvement in the uprising, prompting Mayari's determination to capture their leader and restore order with swift justice.

The trade council, recognizing the urgency of the situation, expresses gratitude for Mayari's decisive action and agrees to her terms, even offering her a seat on the council—a testament to their trust and confidence in her leadership.

As discussions reach a critical juncture, a guard rushes in, warning of an escalating riot beyond the containment zone. The council swiftly takes a final vote, with only one dissenting voice—Hoss, voicing deep reservations about the impending conflict and its toll on their city's once-peaceful existence.

Amidst mounting tension, chaos erupts as a mob breaches the defenses, prompting Mayari and her entourage, along with the council and their guards, to flee through the labyrinthine underground sewers of Telusi. Their numbers swell unexpectedly as they rescue families caught in the turmoil, adding both strength and risk to their escape.

Their frantic flight leads them to a massive lava tube, where tensions boil over as Cockface, one of the councilmen, betrays them, resulting in a violent confrontation that ends in Cockface's demise and a grim realization of the depths of treachery within their ranks.

Mayari, deeply affected by the brutality unfolding before her, wrestles with her emotions and the urge to unleash her formidable powers. However, Fortune's intervention reminds her of their mission's greater purpose and the need for restraint in the face of chaos.

With a mix of desperation and determination, they signal for extraction, braving a barrage of attacks from the armed mob as they load onto a shuttle. In a poignant moment, Mayari is persuaded to leave as Fortune and Steve stay behind to confront the rioters, showcasing their prowess in a cinematic battle that culminates in a hard-won victory against overwhelming odds.

## ARC 8
## SERVICE FOR YOUR SERVICE 

In the hushed ambiance of dawn, with the first light piercing through the dense canopy above their secluded retreat, Mayari embarked on her day with a ritualistic fervor that had become the cornerstone of her existence. The morning began, as it always did, with her standing alone, a figure of discipline amidst the tranquility of her surroundings, meticulously cleansing herself. This was not merely an act of washing away the physical remnants of the previous day but a profound preparation, a purification of body and soul that set the tone for the tasks that lay ahead.

With an intensity born of years of practice, Mayari attended to every inch of her skin, ensuring not a speck of grime remained. This ritual of cleanliness was a legacy of her upbringing within the walls of the Church of Earth Convent, where discipline was not just taught but ingrained into the very fiber of her being. The process was methodical, each movement deliberate, as she cleansed herself with a reverence that bordered on the ceremonial. This was her way of reaffirming her commitment to her principles, a physical manifestation of her inner resolve.

Once the cleansing was complete, Mayari transitioned seamlessly into her regimen of self-care, treating each task with the same meticulous attention to detail. This was her time, moments spent in solitude where she engaged in the intimate act of grooming—plucking, shaving, and attending to her body with an array of manual tools and a small mirror as her only aids. Each action was a meditation, a reaffirmation of her autonomy and her dedication to maintaining not just her physical form but the discipline that underpinned her life.

Naked before the mirror, she studied her physique with a critical eye, posing in ways that highlighted the muscles she had carved with relentless training. This was not vanity but evaluation, an assessment of her strength and the areas that demanded more work. It was a ritual that seamlessly blended self-care with preparation for the physical demands of her day.

Adorned only in workout shoes and socks, Mayari approached her training with a reverent intensity, her body moving with precision as she lifted weights, her strength surpassing that of an ordinary human by far. Each exercise, from squats to deadlifts, was performed with impeccable form, a testament to her discipline and the rigorous training regimen she adhered to. This was not just physical training but a ritual of empowerment, each rep a step toward perfection.

As Mayari engaged in her training, her mind wandered, revisiting past confrontations with adversaries, using these memories as fuel to push her body beyond its limits. The gym became a sanctuary where she not only honed her physical strength but also fortified her mental resilience, preparing herself for any challenges that lay ahead.

This rigorous morning ritual, culminating in a session of physical and mental conditioning, set the stage for the deeply sacred ceremony with her guards. A ritual that was not just about maintaining discipline and purity but about reinforcing the bonds of loyalty and shared purpose that united them. In the solitude of her chamber, Mayari and her guards engaged in a ceremony that was a testament to their collective commitment to their ideals, a ritual that transcended the physical to touch the very essence of their unity and purpose.

From the solitary act of cleansing to the communal bond of the ritual with her guards, Mayari's day was a continuous thread of discipline, dedication, and devotion—a symphony of rituals that defined her life and the community she led.

## ARC 9
## STEVE & FORTUNE RETURN 

After emerging victorious yet physically battered from the treacherous tunnels, Steve and Fortune join their legion in a jubilant celebration, sharing tales of their perilous journey and highlighting the crucial role of mutual support and unwavering faith in Mayari. Amidst the revelry, conversations take a serious turn as rumors swirl about the controversial demise of Councilman Cockface, hinting at a web of political intrigue and violence. Fortune skillfully deflects these inquiries, emphasizing their dedication to their faith and mission rather than entangling themselves in local political affairs.

The festive atmosphere is abruptly interrupted by the arrival of the Telusi Secret Service, led by the enigmatic Detective Dookie, who requests Steve and Fortune's presence at the station for a formal statement. Despite initial reluctance, Fortune sees this as a strategic move beneficial to the crusade's interests and their relationship with the Telusi authorities, thus agreeing to comply.

During their journey to the station, Steve expresses concerns about their relentless exertion without adequate rest, highlighting the toll it takes on their effectiveness and well-being. In response, Fortune reassures him, drawing from Mayari's teachings on unity and purpose, emphasizing the strength they derive from their collective resolve.

Upon arrival at the station, what begins as a routine statement swiftly escalates into a rigorous interrogation, with Detective Dookie delving deep into the circumstances surrounding Councilman Cockface's demise. Steve and Fortune find themselves grappling internally, torn between their commitment to truth and their pragmatic need to navigate the delicate balance with the Telusi authorities.

As Dookie presents skewed versions of events to test their responses, Steve and Fortune confront a moral dilemma, torn between upholding their righteousness and appeasing the Telusi's expectations. They carefully navigate the interrogation, skillfully avoiding direct admission of any culpability while staying true to their core beliefs.

Dookie's probing questions and insinuations challenge their narrative, introducing conflicting perspectives on the nature and actions of the mob involved. The interrogation leaves Steve and Fortune deep in contemplation, forcing them to confront the complex interplay between their ideals, political pressures, and ethical considerations within the volatile landscape of Telusi politics.

## SHAME & PUNISHMENT

After their intense interrogation with Detective Dookie from the Telusi Enforcement Agency, Steve and Fortune return to camp feeling deeply unsettled about their actions. Their minds swirl with questions about their loyalty, their faith, and their purpose in serving Mayari.

Steve, ever the optimist, tries to mend the emotional aftermath by reassuring Fortune that as long as they stick together, they'll weather any storm. However, Fortune's response reveals a deeper layer of their inner turmoil. She believes that their actions must be in alignment with Mayari's guidance and principles to truly be considered righteous and justifiable.

Their transport back to camp takes an unexpected turn when they are redirected to Mayari's quarters along with the Telusi. This sudden change in plans sparks a mixture of anticipation and anxiety in both Steve and Fortune. They wonder what Mayari has in store for them and how their recent actions will be perceived.

Upon arrival, they are informed that Mayari wishes to speak to each of them separately. Steve is the first to be summoned, escorted to an outdoor training area where Mayari awaits in her training gear, a sight that surprises and slightly embarrasses Steve. Mayari wastes no time in challenging Steve to spar with her, stripping him of his clothes and pushing him to prove his worth as her protector. The intense training session becomes a test of loyalty and dedication, with Mayari consistently besting Steve despite his efforts to impress her.

Fortune is called up next and reacts with a mixture of determination and apprehension. She approaches Mayari with humility, offering her service and loyalty without hesitation. However, even Fortune's formidable strength and combat skills fall short of Mayari's expectations during their sparring session.

Mayari's disappointment is palpable as she addresses both Steve and Fortune, highlighting their weaknesses when separated and their lack of strategic thinking when together. She emphasizes that her strength lies not in their protection but in their unique qualities—Steve's intelligence and Fortune's leadership abilities.

After their chastening encounter with Mayari, they are provided with new Class A Dress uniforms, a symbolic gesture of their elevated status and continued importance in Mayari's mission. They are then ushered to an award ceremony attended by thousands, where Mayari and the Telusi honor them with medals for their selfless actions in the tunnels, acknowledging their bravery and dedication to the cause.

In a quieter moment afterward, as they ride down in an elevator, the weight of their recent experiences hangs heavy in the air. Fortune, with blood still on her face from the sparring session, reaches out to hold Steve's hand in a silent gesture of solidarity and mutual understanding. They both recognize that amidst the complexities of their roles and the challenges they face, they can find strength and support in each other's presence.


## IN LEAGUE WITH THE TELUSI

Mayari's briefing with the Telusi council unfolds in a chamber heavy with tension and anticipation. The council members, representing diverse factions within Telusi's governance, sit in somber deliberation as Mayari lays out the intricate plan to regain control of the city amid the escalating riot.

The briefing begins with Mayari's authoritative voice resonating through the chamber, outlining the overarching goals and strategic approach of Operation Balatro. She emphasizes the need for a coordinated effort that leverages the unique strengths of each party involved, including Telusi law enforcement, Steve's expertise, Fortune's aerial reconnaissance capabilities, and Detective Dookie's intelligence network.

As Mayari delves into the details of the plan, she paints a vivid picture of the city's current state—a battleground of chaos and unrest where factions vie for power amidst the upheaval. She highlights the strategic importance of containing the riot's spread, identifying key figures within the insurgent leadership, and neutralizing critical observation points and communication relays used by the rioters.

Steve's role takes center stage as he proposes a comprehensive strategy for law enforcement collaboration, including the construction of prison camps outside the city to detain rioters and the implementation of stringent measures to maintain order. His emphasis on rewarding righteous behavior aligned with Mayari's code underscores the moral compass guiding their actions amid the chaos.

Fortune's aerial surveillance plan adds a layer of strategic insight, aiming to identify and target key figures orchestrating the riot's maneuvers. The coordination between Fortune and Detective Dookie's observation efforts becomes a crucial element in pinpointing strategic vulnerabilities within the insurgent ranks.

The narrative tension heightens as Mayari addresses dissenting voices within the council regarding the rules of engagement and the treatment of high-value targets. The deliberation captures the internal struggles and ethical dilemmas faced by the council members, reflecting the complex interplay of power dynamics and moral imperatives in times of crisis.

The scene shifts seamlessly to the operational phase of Operation Balatro, where Steve's initial encounters with the Chief of Police reveal conflicting approaches and challenges in gaining cooperation. The narrative delves into the tactical maneuvers, clashes, and eventual alignment between Steve's forces and the police, showcasing the evolution of their partnership in restoring order.

Simultaneously, Fortune and Detective Dookie's aerial observations provide critical intelligence, leading to decisive interventions that disrupt insurgent operations and prevent further escalation of violence. The interplay between aerial surveillance, ground operations, and strategic decision-making underscores the multifaceted nature of the operation and the collaborative effort required for success.

Amidst the operational successes, a subplot unfolds involving a covert infiltration mission orchestrated by Steve and his team, exposing internal corruption and espionage within the police force. This subplot adds layers of intrigue and suspense, revealing hidden agendas and betrayals that complicate the already volatile landscape of Telusi's governance.

The narrative culminates in a dramatic sequence where Ethan, a high-ranking police officer caught in the web of corruption, navigates a perilous path of deception, betrayal, and survival. His actions and decisions mirror the larger themes of power struggles and moral ambiguity woven throughout the narrative, leading to a climactic confrontation with far-reaching consequences.

Throughout the expanded summary, the intricate details of the plan, the dynamics between key characters, and the moral complexities of their actions are explored in depth, immersing the reader in a richly textured narrative of political intrigue, strategic warfare, and personal sacrifice in the quest for order and justice in a tumultuous city.

## THE DOCKS

In this narrative sequence, two insurgency leaders undergo separate interrogations reminiscent of the previous intense sessions with Steve and Fortune. Unlike Steve and Fortune, these leaders break under pressure, revealing crucial information about the insurgency's headquarters and leadership locations. Their testimonies align, providing corroborative evidence.

The scene shifts to a gathering of the entire leadership group, including Mayari, who stands before a web-like visual board displaying the investigation details. Mayari, cautious and meticulous, seeks confirmation from Fortune, emphasizing the consequences of a misstep.

Fortune embarks on a deep surveillance mission with Dookie, establishing a perch atop a large crane overlooking the orbital port yards, a major trading hub on the moon. Below them, riots controlled by the insurgency still rage, complicating the situation.

During a quiet moment, Dookie's curiosity leads to a discussion about Mayari's strategic decisions. Fortune cryptically hints at their code of conduct, emphasizing the importance of virtue and loyalty within their ranks.

As they observe the container ship suspected of harboring Dragoon Cosmos, a key figure in the insurgency, a critical moment unfolds when a man delivers food matching Dragoon's dietary preferences. Although it's not definitive proof, it adds weight to their suspicions.

Dookie examines a receipt matching the food order but acknowledges the need for positive identification of Dragoon Cosmos. Fortune explains the challenges of exposing Dragoon, highlighting the risk involved in their mission.

Dookie questions the consequences of failure, to which Fortune responds with determination – if they fail, they will resort to taking control of the city. This statement underscores the gravity of their mission and the lengths they are willing to go to achieve their goals.

The narrative captures the tension, strategic planning, and moral dilemmas faced by Fortune, Dookie, and their allies as they navigate through a complex web of allegiances and challenges in their pursuit of justice and control over the city.

## OP FOR

Amidst the haunting silence of the docks, a tempest of comets heralds the onset of an unparalleled storm, setting the stage for a covert operation of critical importance. A comet storm near the docks initiates a series of events where Mayari and her specialized team seize the opportunity to conduct a critical mission, akin to historical military operations or tactical gameplay scenarios like those found in Rainbow Six Siege. Their target is a cargo yacht, commandeered by an adversary known only as the Dragoon, who anticipates their arrival. The operation requires a blend of stealth and aggressive tactics to penetrate the yacht's defenses, as the team, supported by allies named Fortune and Steve, disables external security measures and power sources while dealing with the yacht's internal defenses activated by the captains, or mini-bosses.

The team's primary objective is to disable five auxiliary power units and secure keys to access the bridge, believed to be the Dragoon's location. Despite facing losses, they systematically dismantle the yacht's power units and mini-bosses. However, the mission escalates unexpectedly when the yacht begins to ascend into orbit, cutting off ground support and forcing Mayari to make strategic decisions, including the evacuation of injured members and a final assault on the bridge with her remaining teammates.

The climax intensifies as the team confronts multiple bosses in a dark, quiet push towards the bridge, leading to a dramatic confrontation with the Dragoon in zero gravity. In a surprising twist, Thane Krios, an assassin with motives of his own, intervenes, ultimately siding with peace over further conflict, thus stopping the yacht's uncontrolled ascent and leaving it in a stable orbit.

The story concludes with a profound moment of reflection as Mayari and her team, in the aftermath of their tumultuous journey, gaze upon the moon from their unprecedented vantage point in orbit. This moment transcends their immediate circumstances, inviting them to contemplate their place in the universe and the significance of their home from a perspective none had experienced before.


## YIN YANG

In the aftermath of a critical mission on a container yacht commandeered by the Dragoon, Steve and his soldiers start transferring containers down to the Telusi, distributing them among the rebels to aid their cause. Meanwhile, Fortune oversees the re-opening of the port from a control tower as trade yachts begin to dock, signaling a return to normalcy.

Mayari, the protagonist and leader of this rebel group, visits Thane in a makeshift brig on the yacht. Thane, an assassin previously aligned with Akali, confesses that his time observing Mayari has led him to question his own beliefs and allegiances. He explains his original motivation for working with Akali was revenge against his family, who betrayed him. Yet, witnessing Mayari's actions and philosophy has introduced him to a new way of thinking, one that contrasts sharply with Akali's destructive nature.

Thane characterizes Akali as a conqueror who finds peace in the destruction of perceived weakness, a stark contrast to the numbing pleasures of sex and drugs Mayari recalls from their shared past in the Church. Mayari, in turn, is portrayed as a thinker and a warrior with a different approach to achieving her goals, leading to a moment of unexpected levity when she laughs so hard at the absurdity of their situation.

Their conversation delves into the motivations behind Mayari's daring operation on the yacht, highlighting her commitment to her people and the sacrifices made to secure a future free from oppression. Thane challenges Mayari's justifications, prompting her to assert her strength and resolve against any threats, including betrayal from within her own ranks.

This dialogue reveals the philosophical divergence between Mayari and Akali, with Mayari choosing a path of justice and protection over Akali's path of destruction. The discussion takes a personal turn as Thane provocatively suggests similarities between Mayari and Akali, despite Mayari's denial of her past allegiances and her resolve to fight for what she believes is good.

The tension escalates when Thane touches upon the consequences of vengeance and the inherent challenges in defining and combating evil. Mayari's determination to protect her newfound community and her ambiguous relationship with the Church's teachings highlight her complex character.

Thane concludes by framing both himself and Mayari as unintended instruments of reckoning for their respective factions, suggesting that together they herald the dawn of a new era beyond the control of the Church and the Soviet influences. He hints at revealing the true nature of the Fenrir, a civilization hidden on the dark side of the moon, suggesting deeper layers of conflict and potential alliances in the struggle for freedom and identity.


## BILLROY

a shared history of animosity fueled by the Dragoon's vendetta.

As Steve successfully pinpoints the signal's origin within the vessel, Mayari's negotiation tactics intensify, speculating on the Billroy captain's fear of mortality and alleged pact with the Dragoon for a utopian life on Earth. This ploy, alongside the looming threat of a reactor meltdown, culminates in a psychological standoff.

The deadlock is broken as the moral fortitude of the Billroy captain wavers, leading to the lifting of the lockdown, just as Steve's team locates him. To their surprise, they find not one, but a family of approximately thirty Billroys, revealing a saga of survival that extends beyond mere piracy.

In the aftermath, Mayari brokers a resolution, offering the Billroy captain and his family protection, amnesty in Telusi, and the captaincy of a newly designated "homeyacht." This accord, solidified by the renaming of the vessel to "Expedition Yacht Bluff" or "EY Bluff," symbolizes the strategic deception that was pivotal in resolving the crisis and heralds a new chapter in the complex narrative of space commerce and bioengineered sentience.

This resolution not only underscores the intricate dance of leadership and negotiation but also the profound ethical considerations at play when lives—bioengineered or not—are entangled in the web of cosmic trade and geopolitical maneuvering. The saga of the BILLROY3927, now known as the EY Bluff, becomes a testament to the challenges and opportunities that lie in the intersection of biotechnology, commerce, and the inexorable quest for a harmonious existence among the stars.


## THANE'S PHAGE

Thane's battle against the relentless phage on the deck of the EY Bluff is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, yet as the disease encroaches upon his very essence, desperation sets in. In a bid for hope, Mayari turns to the Billroy, whose wisdom is conveyed through an advanced floating robot intelligence, reminiscent of the prophetic entities from Halo. They hint at a possible salvation within the thriving inter-lunar civilization, a beacon of commerce and unity amidst the solitude enforced by Earth's Kessler Syndrome and the ideological battles on the moon.

However, their path is thwarted by silence from Comet Station Gabriel, a linchpin in their plan, now ominously unresponsive and flagged as hostile in the cosmic web of alliances. With the station's xenologist as their only lead, the situation grows dire as Thane's makeshift ICU, akin to a NICU for the Billroy's offspring, falls short of sustaining him.

Mayari's inquiry into Thane's resilience against the phage, his unique affliction, and his veiled past on the moon's dark side, yields no answers, as Thane's strength wanes. Her resolve, however, remains unshaken, even as the pomp of a dinner with Telusi's trade council tests her patience. Frustration mounts as bureaucratic assurances clash with the urgency of Thane's condition, igniting Mayari's determination to cut through the political quagmire.

With the assistance of Chupapi, a council member sympathetic to her cause, Mayari embarks on a dual mission: to rehabilitate Telusi and to mend the fractured relations with Comet Station Gabriel. This complex dance of diplomacy and reconstruction aims not only to save Thane but to weave a tapestry of unity across the stars.

As the Billroy and Comet Station Gabriel prepare for a historic meeting, the void between them is filled with a fleet of ships, with a single TEU container serving as the stage for negotiations. Here, Mayari, chosen to voice the Billroy's plea, encounters Saladin, a figure whose presence holds the promise of bridging worlds or deepening divides.

This narrative, stripped of its headings, weaves together the threads of Thane's fight for life, Mayari's leadership against the odds, and the cosmic ballet of diplomacy and destiny. It paints a picture of a universe where individual fates are intertwined with the greater movements of civilizations, all under the watchful eyes of ancient powers.


## A Caboose named Saladin 

In a tense encounter aboard the TEU container serving as a neutral negotiation space, Mayari and her entourage face off with a man claiming to be Saladin. He lounges casually, indulging in a lavish spread of unfamiliar food, insisting on a feast before discussions—a tradition they find alien and unsettling. Despite his open disrespect, marked by his relaxed posture and snacking with his mouth full, he greets them by name, emphasizing the importance of this pre-negotiation ritual.

The atmosphere thickens with tension as Mayari's group, taken aback by Saladin's demeanor and the opulence before them, refuses to partake or even sit, standing in silent protest. Saladin, now referred to as Pewp, chastises them for their apparent lack of respect for his customs, escalating the standoff. Steve, speaking on behalf of the group, confronts Pewp about his skewed sense of tradition and respect, highlighting the aggressive posture of his space armada against the solitary Billroy ship—a gesture that hardly suggests a peaceful intent.

Following Pewp's abrupt departure, the space is quickly transformed: the table's shape, the lighting, and even the seating arrangements are altered to facilitate a more focused dialogue. The Billroy then relay to Mayari that the Comet's armada is retreating, save for one ship, signaling a shift in the negotiation's dynamic.

Saladin re-enters, this time adopting a more formal and respectful demeanor. Kneeling in a gesture of moon folk tradition, he introduces himself officially, expressing regret over his initial approach. His actions reveal a man deeply invested in the intricacies of lunar conflicts, human nature, and the principles of chivalry and respect. Opening a visual link to the moon, he shares his vision for instilling respect and preservation above all, starkly contrasting the battle for resources that defines lunar politics.

As the conversation unfolds, Saladin's stance softens, apologizing for the earlier hostility and making it clear that while they are welcome, they must adapt to the customs of his domain. The handshake that follows marks a cautious truce, with Saladin's departure back to the Comet punctuating the end of this initial, uneasy meeting.

Fortune's muttered threat against Saladin underlines the lingering tension and mistrust, while Mayari's response hints at the complexities and dangers that still lie ahead. As the Bluff docks at the mooring station orbiting the Comet, they are thrust into the limelight, met with a barrage of attention that underscores the significance of their mission and the looming challenges, not least of which is Thane's deteriorating condition—a stark reminder of the stakes at play in this delicate dance of diplomacy and survival in the cosmos.


##  Surrender Your Weapons

In the complex web of alliances and conflicts within the MOON\SAGA universe, Mayari finds herself at a crossroads, navigating the murky waters of morality and survival. The Oldbad, likened to outlaws in a lawless space, stand in stark contrast to Saladin's structured order. Saladin, holding the promise of a cure for Thane, conditions his help on receiving compelling information that could sway him to make a righteous decision.

Before making her pivotal decision, Mayari visits Thane, who is preserved in a cryochamber to slow the deadly phage's progression. This could be their final conversation, and Thane entrusts her with the choice, confident in her judgment that has historically led to outcomes better than he could have envisioned. He emphasizes that the true threat lies not with his condition but with the mysteries of the dark side of the moon.

Seeking wisdom, Mayari turns to those she has previously saved, only to find them preoccupied with their own advancements, offering little more than gratitude. In her moment of isolation, she resorts to a secretive ritual from the Church of Earth that sharpens her focus, involving a meditative practice in zero gravity pools.

Resolved, Mayari decides to understand the conflict from the perspective of the Oldbad by immersing herself in their orbit. There, she discovers a community of space dwellers living like the characters in a space-age 'Red Dead Redemption 2,' adhering to age-old principles of independence and survival. To earn their trust, she engages with a fixer named Zantai, undertaking dangerous tasks that bring her closer to the heart of the Oldbad community.

Through her ventures, Mayari learns of the Oldbad's symbiotic relationship with the Whales—a species that provides guidance and continuity for the Oldbad's way of life through a matrix-like connection, preserving their collective memories and experiences within the Whales' care.

As Mayari contemplates the implications of her findings, she realizes the true source of the Oldbad’s power: their interdependence with the Whales. Armed with this knowledge, she faces a moral dilemma. At the moment the Oldbad accept her as one of their own, she chooses to leave, driven by the urgency of Thane's plight, to negotiate with Saladin.

Returning with critical information, Mayari seeks to negotiate, but Saladin, feeling betrayed by her empathy for the Oldbad and her decision to prioritize Thane’s life, confines her comfortably yet restrictively. Disappointed, Saladin fears the impending conflict, seeing it as inevitable due to Mayari's actions.

Warned by Mayari of the potential for massive loss of life, Saladin is left contemplating the stark reality that his civilization lacks the 'source of power' that others, like the Oldbad, possess. This revelation not only sets the stage for a broader conflict but also highlights the deep-seated jealousies and strategic disparities between the different powers within the MOON\SAGA universe.


## Alamo Alamo Alamo 

Amidst the desolate, windswept saloon towns of the Oldbad territories, a dark cloud descends as Saladin’s lawmen, acting on his orders, begin a rigorous crackdown. Large groups of these enforcers round up and detain anyone identified as belonging to the Oldbad community. In the chaos, Zentai, a figure of influence and trust within the Oldbad, finds himself accused of treason, the community leaders convinced that his actions have precipitated Saladin’s aggressive moves and the potential downfall of their way of life.

Zentai, caught in a web of suspicion and desperation, pleads for reason, insisting that if only Mayari had shared everything she knew, they might have discovered and protected the whales—key to their survival and prosperity. Under immense pressure to resolve the crisis, Zentai reaches out to the Whales for guidance. Yet, for the first time, the Whales offer no answers, only revealing to Zentai an ancient artifact: a suit of power armor, symbolizing an envoy of peace from times long past.

Driven by the urgent need to alter the course of events, Zentai takes a bold leap, riding his space horse to the lunar city of Telusi. There, he reveals Mayari’s plight to her trusted comrades, Fortune and Steve, and together they orchestrate a daring stealth operation. They successfully break Mayari out, leaving Zentai in her place—a decoy intended to mislead Saladin into believing Mayari has escaped.

Reunited with the Oldbad, Mayari's connection with the Whales deepens. She persuades them to leave for their safety, while simultaneously hatching a plan to stage their escape as a distraction. The Whales, tapping into their vast store of knowledge, provide schematics for an ancient cannon capable of launching Mayari across the moon to investigate its dark side—a place shrouded in mystery and apparent conflict.

As Mayari prepares for her journey, the Oldbad stage a desperate last stand, reminiscent of the Alamo, to launch her towards the moon’s hidden face. The thematic duality sharpens as Mayari finds herself on one side of a looming siege while Saladin commands the opposite.

Landing on the other side of the moon, Mayari is confronted with a sight unimaginable—a sprawling megalopolis, a half-moon megacity scarred by war and destruction. The heart of this city is dominated by a colossal, biblically accurate angel powering a moon-boring machine, drilling towards Earth. Above, a surreal vision unfolds as a giant nether portal opens, revealing a burning eye and spectral arms reaching out towards her, threatening to pull her into another dimension.

Amidst this chaos, Mayari is once again shot down, echoing her previous descent. She survives, but the siege's toll is devastating. The Oldbad suffer heavy casualties, leaving only a few survivors who vow to undertake a pilgrimage in search of the Whales, hoping to discover where these guardians of their heritage have fled.

This narrative arc weaves a complex tapestry of betrayal, survival, and mystical encounters, marking a critical juncture in the MOON\SAGA universe where past and future collide in the shadow of ancient legacies and cosmic destinies.
