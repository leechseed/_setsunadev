 ## LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING...

 ## PRE-MEAL...

### FROM YESTERDAY'S POST

 ## NOTES

 A lot has happened today in regards of working

 - focusing a push on implementing the krebs cycle of creativity to the 'brood engine' 
   - the whole cycle is a system and i need to break it down to several parts and identify where exactly a 'pattern' fits into each of the sub-systems in the cycle
   - once i've found a way to separate each part of the system, identify and define each part, i then can find a way to label each pattern thru yaml 
 - although right now i think teh best thing to focus on is all of the data already created in terms of using YAML as a method of metadata
