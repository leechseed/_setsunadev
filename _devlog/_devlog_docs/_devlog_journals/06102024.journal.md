- i should create a .py script to convert webms to .gifs
- honestly i probably already have some
- i did a lot today...jesus. 
- biggest thing is that i linked my vscode from my laptop to my pc. 
- its all being backed up now thru google and git
- the biggest thing i need to tackle is the beast of a yaml
  - i'll need to create some sort of YAML directory 
  - along side the YAML directory I'll need to create a knowledgebase that defines each tag in the directory
- before that however, i need to break down the krebs cycle into smaller more digestible graphic organizers so i can better theorize to how to categorize by and organize concepts
- remember the concept of how a full krebs cycle can be considered a 'system' of a pattern. 
- another way to add depth and perhaps some sort of other method to graph shit and glean info.
