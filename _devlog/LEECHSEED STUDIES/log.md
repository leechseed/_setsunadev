- The current objective is to complete a first draft of a novel based on an experimental process using the following intertextual concepts:
  - Dungeons and Dragons as an established stucture to understand the nature of storyforming. 

- Once the entire adventure is complete, the next step will be to evaluate the feasability of recontextualizing the adventure into a narrative prose story. The following intertextual concepts will be used to evaluate the viability:
  - Narratology

- Once a preliminary evaluation is complete, the chef will analyze the results and determine the next course of action. 
- If the chef determines the data provided by the evaluation is sufficient to proceed with the third phase of the expirment, then a new directive must be assigned. 
- There are three choices:
  - Proceed with a linear path pursuing the intertextual methodolgoy of Dramatica 
  - OR
  - Proceed with a linear path pursuing the intertextual methodology of Rapid Story Development 
  - OR 
  - A supreme mixture of both. 
- Further directives must be established by the chef after the result of the previous choice. 

Amen. Bon Appetit
