**Safety Position :** In safety, Fives with a Four wing may find a nice balance between their thinking and feeling. They may also be able to connect more deeply in human interactions, and the Five’s tendency to sit back and observe may find a balance with actual involvement through action. Fives with a Six wing may resource the Six’s natural courage to find a stronger sense of presence; they may become more committed to people and ideals rather than information, and the Five’s ability to assess data and evidence may help them take positions on principle, not just on the facts. 

**Fear Position :** In fear, Fives with a Four wing may withdraw even deeper into their mental machinations and analysis; the Five’s inner sense of separateness may lead to moodiness and depression. Appearing emotionally distant, the Four’s influence may feed their fear of rejection and generate a need to stand out in a unique way. Fives with a Six wing may find the Six’s mistrust and doubt pushing them more into withdrawal; they may find their thinking unbalanced toward fear and worst-case scenarios, and the Five’s already strong tendency for planning might become obsessive and neurotic


4 - Two-strikes 
Two-Strikes is a leader for the steveadors. He is also one of the few people who listens to Zaku and trusts him. 
5 - Zaku 

Zaku trusts Two-strikes. Two-strikes is the type to give Zaku enough courage to do something, to learn something, to experience something, instead of keeping his nose in the books. 

Zaku values Yesac's input, but he feels threatened by his ability to point out Zaku's weakness. Zaku wishes he could learn to think like him, but for some reason Zaku either refuses to or is incapabable of doing so. 


6 - Yesac
Yesac provides emotional perspective, a clear lens thru Zaku's moral blind spot. He primarily functions as, 'what they say doesn't mean what they say.'
