>[!yellow] Step 2: Define the Protagonist's Enneagram style



## 1. Why does Zaku have the most to lose?
Based on the provided information, Zaku has a lot to lose primarily due to the high expectations and responsibilities placed upon him by his community and his personal experiences. Here are the key reasons why Zaku feels this pressure:

1. **Community's Expectation**: The people around Zaku see him as a hero and believe he is destined for greatness. This belief places a heavy burden on Zaku, as he feels responsible for their survival and protection. The community's dependence on him for becoming a hero adds to his fear of failing them.

2. **Role as a Leader**: His actions against the abusive ship captain and his role in helping the stevedores unionize have positioned him as a protector and leader. This past success adds pressure, as Zaku believes he must continue to gain experience, skills, and resources to protect his community against future threats.

3. **Worldly Experience**: Zaku's extensive travel has provided him with unique insights and skills, which he uses to benefit his community in Neverwinter. His ability to protect those exploited by others due to his experiences adds to the expectation that he will continually serve and safeguard his community.

4. **Family Legacy**: Coming from a family that, despite challenges, became caretakers and cultivators of their community, Zaku feels an inherent responsibility to continue this legacy. He may not believe in destiny, but he recognizes the uniqueness of his life's circumstances and feels obligated to use them for the greater good.

In summary, Zaku's moral blind spot – his overwhelming fear of incompetence – is significantly amplified by these external expectations and internal beliefs. He fears not just personal failure, but failing his community, which looks up to him as a protector and leader. This fear drives him to overcompensate through controlling and potentially self-destructive behaviors, as he struggles to live up to the hero image others have of him and that he, to some extent, believes he must fulfill.

## 2. Why does Zaku have the most emotional pain?

Zaku's emotional pain stems from a complex and tumultuous relationship with Mayari, a character who challenges and contradicts his moral compass and sense of self. Here's why this relationship causes him profound emotional pain:

1. **Contrasting Values and Ideals**: Zaku, as the self-proclaimed hero of the docks, stands for justice and order, whereas Mayari, with her background and actions, represents aspects he fundamentally opposes – selfishness, violence, and chaos. This conflict between his values and his feelings for her creates internal turmoil.

2. **Inexplicable Attraction**: Despite everything he stands against, Zaku finds himself infatuated with Mayari, a fact that baffles and troubles him. His attraction to someone who embodies what he fights against causes a deep emotional conflict.

3. **Harsh Rejection and Misunderstanding**: Mayari's outright rejection of Zaku's help and her accusation of him being a creep and a tyrant adds to his emotional pain. It not only wounds his ego but also makes him question his role and identity as a hero.

4. **Shared Goal, Different Methods**: Zaku learns that Mayari's objective to aid sex workers mirrors his fight for the stevedores' rights. This similarity draws him closer to her, despite their vastly different methods, further complicating his feelings.

5. **Tragic Outcome and Betrayal**: The revelation of Mayari's true plan, leading to violence and chaos, and her accusation that he is no different from her, profoundly impacts Zaku. It shatters his self-image and deepens his emotional trauma, especially as he finds himself inadvertently responsible for the bloodshed.

6. **Mayari's Final Act and Disappearance**: The culmination of their interaction, where Mayari kisses him and then disappears after implying that love will destroy him, leaves Zaku with a sense of loss, guilt, and confusion. This event haunts him, overshadowing his quest to be a hero with a personal emotional struggle.

Zaku's most significant emotional pain, therefore, lies in the dichotomy between his desire to be a righteous hero and his deep, conflicting feelings for Mayari. Her presence in his life challenges his ideals, creates internal conflict, leads to tragic consequences, and ultimately leaves him questioning his own morality and purpose. His journey to Elder Runara signifies not just a pursuit of his destiny but also a quest to resolve the deep emotional scars left by his relationship with Mayari.
## 3. Why does Zaku change the most?

Based on the information provided about Zaku's character, his moral blind spot, emotional challenges, and the events he experiences, the most significant transformation he can undergo would be evolving from a person driven by a fear of incompetence and a rigid sense of heroism to someone who embraces vulnerability, understands the complexity of morality, and recognizes the value of empathy and collaboration.

1. **From Fear of Incompetence to Embracing Vulnerability**: Initially, Zaku is crippled by a fear of incompetence, leading him to overcompensate through controlling and defensive behaviors. His transformation would involve acknowledging and accepting his vulnerabilities and limitations, understanding that true strength lies in being open to learning, growth, and occasionally, failure.

2. **From Rigid Heroism to Moral Complexity**: Zaku starts with a black-and-white view of the world, seeing himself as the hero against the evils of his environment. His experiences with Mayari and the ensuing events challenge this view. His transformation would involve realizing that morality isn't always clear-cut and that heroism can take many forms, including understanding and forgiving.

3. **From Self-Reliance to Valuing Others**: Zaku's initial belief in his sole responsibility for the well-being of his community and his need to control situations hinder his relationships and blind him to the strengths of others. His transformation would lead him to appreciate the importance of community, collaboration, and trusting in the abilities and judgments of others.

4. **From Condemning to Empathizing**: Initially, Zaku is quick to judge and condemn behaviors and people that don't align with his moral code, like Mayari. His transformation would involve developing empathy, understanding that people's actions are often driven by their circumstances, and that understanding and compassion can be more powerful than judgment.

5. **From Single-Minded Pursuit to Holistic Understanding**: Initially, Zaku is solely focused on his goal of being a hero. His transformation would see him recognizing that being a true hero involves not just fighting external battles but also addressing internal conflicts, healing emotional wounds, and understanding the nuanced dynamics of the world around him.

This transformation would make Zaku a more rounded, relatable, and compelling character, with a journey that resonates on a deeper emotional level with the audience. It would also provide a rich narrative arc, filled with conflict, growth, and ultimately, a more profound sense of resolution and self-awareness.


## Which of the controlling emotions feel like Zaku's root emotion?

Given Zaku's character traits and journey as described in previous discussions, the controlling emotion that best represents his root emotion is fear. Several key aspects of his character and story align with this:

1. **Fear of Incompetence**: Zaku's moral blind spot is his overwhelming fear of being seen as incompetent. This fear drives much of his behavior, including his need to control situations and his reluctance to trust others.

2. **Fear Driving Protective Behaviors**: His actions, especially in trying to be the hero of the docks and in his interactions with Mayari, seem to stem from a deep-seated fear of failure and of not living up to expectations, rather than from anger or hostility.

3. **Fear and Vulnerability in Relationships**: His complex feelings towards Mayari and his struggle with her contradictory nature indicate an underlying fear of emotional vulnerability and the potential for personal failure in relationships.

4. **Fear as a Response to Challenges**: Throughout the narrative, when faced with challenges, Zaku's response tends to lean towards defensive and controlling behaviors, which are typically rooted in fear rather than anger or hostility.

In summary, while Zaku may exhibit anger or hostility in certain situations, these emotions are more likely symptoms or manifestations of a deeper, underlying fear that governs his actions and decisions. This fear is central to his character development and the resolution of his internal conflicts.

## What best describes Zaku's reaction to his emotional core of fear and anxiety? (5) Withdrawal, (6) Worry and Doubt, or (7) mental numbness thru substance?

Based on the character description and behaviors of Zaku, his reaction to his emotional core of fear and anxiety aligns most closely with that of a Five in the Enneagram – Withdrawal. Here's why this response is the most fitting:

- **Retreating into Analysis**: Zaku's tendency to over-analyze situations and his need for control stem from a desire to thoroughly understand and manage his environment, which is a characteristic response of a Five. He seems to retreat into his thoughts, seeking safety in analysis and planning.

- **Avoidance of Emotional Vulnerability**: Zaku's interactions, especially with Mayari, demonstrate a reluctance to confront his emotional vulnerabilities. Instead of dealing with his feelings directly, he withdraws into a more comfortable, intellectual approach to his problems.

- **Pursuit of Knowledge as a Defense**: Zaku's background and actions suggest that he equips himself with knowledge and skills as a way to counteract his fear of incompetence. This accumulation of knowledge is a typical Five strategy for coping with anxiety.

- **Isolation in Stressful Situations**: When faced with challenging or stressful scenarios, Zaku's instinct seems to be to isolate himself and rely on his own judgment and capabilities, rather than seeking support or confronting his emotions directly.

While elements of Worry and Doubt (Six) and Mental Numbness through Substance (Seven) might occasionally surface in Zaku's behavior, the predominant pattern of withdrawal into thought and self-reliance aligns him more closely with the typical response of a Five. His actions and decisions throughout the narrative are driven by a desire to manage his fear and anxiety through intellectual understanding and control, rather than through constant preparation for contingencies or escapism into pleasure.

- **Controlling Environment**: Focuses on making his surroundings safe by controlling information.

This triangle encapsulates the dynamic range of his character's journey and the choices he faces in responding to challenges.
