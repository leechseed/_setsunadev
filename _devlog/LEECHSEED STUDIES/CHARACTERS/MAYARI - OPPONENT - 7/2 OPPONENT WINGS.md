Safety Position : When safe, Sevens with a Six wing may be more deliberative and studied in their decision-making. Their drive for total freedom may be balanced by the Six’s inclination to work with a trusted group of people, and the Seven’s tendency not to get pinned down may become grounded by the Six’s planning and foresight.

8 - Aleia 
Aleia is a disciplined ninja fighter from the secret assassin angels (use a name from biblical times) who has been locked in a pitched centuries long battle between the Zealots of Nasus. She lives by a code, but like Mayari, is an outcast. Blamed for the death of her master, she is hunted by her own kind. Her only way of bidding favor with the schools of her kind is to bring the head of a Zealot Primarch, one who now presides over the city of Neverwinter.
