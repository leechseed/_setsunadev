# organizing and plotting the data of the suzuyhet and of the fabula theoretically can be organized within a time-series like data structure. 

- Research has guided me to believe that it is possible to create a data visiualization similar to that of trading view, a complex series of data points over time that eventually tell a story. 
- First step is to create units of time to plot the data on . 


Certainly, here's the narrative time and structure framework formatted for better legibility in Markdown:

### Narrative Time and Structure Framework

1. **Moment**
   - The most instantaneous unit of narrative time, capturing a brief, singular event or realization.

2. **Beat**
   - A slight pause or subtle moment of change within a scene, indicating shifts in emotion, intention, or dynamics between characters.

3. **Scene**
   - A sequence of actions, dialogues, and events occurring in a specific location and time frame, forming a cohesive unit of the narrative.

4. **Sequence**
   - A series of scenes connected by a specific narrative thread, contributing to the development of a subplot, theme, or character arc within the larger story.

5. **Act**
   - A major division within the narrative, comprising multiple sequences and scenes, which delineates a significant phase of the plot or character development.

6. **Episode**
   - Typically used in serialized narratives like TV shows or series of novellas, an episode is a self-contained unit of the story that also contributes to the overall narrative arc.

7. **Arc**
   - A comprehensive narrative element that spans multiple episodes or acts, focusing on the evolution, climax, and resolution of specific themes, character developments, or subplots.

8. **Volume**
   - In literature, especially in series of novels or comics, a volume encompasses several arcs or episodes, bound together as a single book or installment within a series.

9. **Saga**
    - The broadest unit, a saga encompasses multiple volumes, telling an extensive story that can cover generations of characters, vast geographies, or long periods, often with interwoven arcs and themes.

This framework provides a structured approach to analyzing narrative structures, from the smallest details to overarching themes and developments.


## One thing to be mindful of are the different methods of categorization of history/story time that exist betweeen mediums as well as in academic schools. 
 
- For Example
  - In historiography, time is segmented into 'periods' in a process known as periodizaiton. 
  - These periods vary and overlap depending on the academic branch. 
    - Technology
    - Philosophy
    - Archeology
  - **The purpose of periodization is to understand how causality may link one period to another.**

**Each unit that is nested in between each other is known as a 'period of time.'**
