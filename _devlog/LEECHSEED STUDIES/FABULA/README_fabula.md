# README for the Fabula Folder

## Overview

Welcome to the `fabula` folder, a dedicated space within our broader narratology research topic. This folder focuses on the structural elements of storytelling, specifically exploring the concept of "fabula" â€” the chronological sequence of events in a narrative as they happen in the story world, before they are rearranged into the plot or "sjuzhet" by the storyteller.

The `fabula` embodies the raw material of a story, including actions, events, characters, and their motivations, which are then woven into a compelling narrative through the art of storytelling. This folder aims to collate research, articles, and resources that delve into understanding, analyzing, and utilizing these elements to create engaging and meaningful narratives.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this folder is to:
- Serve as a repository for scholarly articles, guides, and resources on the concept of fabula within narratology.
- Provide insights into how the sequential events of a story are constructed to form the basis of storytelling.
- Offer tools, methods, and examples for writers and researchers to understand and apply the principles of fabula in their work.
