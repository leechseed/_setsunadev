Kali's immoral effect, the behavioral manifestation of her moral blind spot, likely involves actions or strategies that, while intending to protect her autonomy and strength, inadvertently hurt or neglect the needs and feelings of others. Her behaviors, driven by an intense focus on maintaining control and avoiding vulnerability, can lead to negative impacts on those around her. Here's how Kali's immoral effect might manifest in her interactions and decisions:

### DOMINANT, DISMISSIVE, WITHDRAWN

1. **Dominance Over Cooperation**:
    - In her pursuit of control, Kali might assert dominance in ways that stifle collaboration or the input of others. This can lead to environments where people feel overpowered or unable to contribute, damaging teamwork and stifling the growth of relationships and projects.

2. **Dismissal of Vulnerability**:
    - Kali might dismiss or criticize vulnerability in others, seeing it as a weakness. While this might be a strategy to maintain her image of strength, it can leave others feeling unsupported, ashamed of their emotions, or reluctant to share, thereby eroding trust and intimacy in relationships.

3. **Aggressive Conflict Resolution**:
    - Her approach to conflict might be overly aggressive or confrontational, prioritizing a quick resolution over understanding or compromise. While effective in the short term, this can lead to long-term damage in relationships, creating an atmosphere of fear or resentment rather than mutual respect.

4. **Neglect of Emotional Needs**:
    - Kali may neglect the emotional needs of herself and those around her, focusing instead on practicalities or the pursuit of goals. This neglect can result in a lack of emotional connection and support, leaving her and others feeling isolated or undervalued.

5. **Manipulation to Maintain Control**:
    - She might manipulate situations or people to maintain control, using her strength and assertiveness not just to lead but to ensure outcomes align with her desires. This manipulation can undermine the autonomy and agency of others, leading to feelings of being used or disrespected.

Addressing this immoral effect involves Kali becoming more conscious of how her actions and decisions impact others. It's about finding a balance where she can honor her need for strength and independence without compromising the well-being, autonomy, and emotional needs of those around her. This journey requires self-awareness, empathy, and a willingness to embrace vulnerability as a strength, recognizing that true leadership involves fostering an environment of trust, respect, and mutual support.
