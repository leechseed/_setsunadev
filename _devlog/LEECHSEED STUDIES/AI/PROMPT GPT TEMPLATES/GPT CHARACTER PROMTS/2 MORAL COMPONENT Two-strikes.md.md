# Template of Questions Based on Two-strikes' Moral Foundation

>[!green] 1 What is Two-strikes' core fear?
> Each of the Enneagram styles has a core fear that is consistent with their overall style (Figure 4.3 ). This fear reflects directly back to the focus of attention and the survival strategy. the core fear of each style reflects that style’s focus of attention and their survival strategy. Since Two-strikes is a (4), his core fear is 'to be ordinary'. Provide several concepts that reinforce the theory of how core fear, focus of attention, and survival strategy are linked, and how these concepts can be expressed thru the character development of Two-strikes within the story.

> 1. **Fear of Emotional Pain**: Mayari's primary fear is the deep-seated aversion to experiencing emotional pain and suffering. This fear is not just about avoiding physical discomfort but extends to deeper emotional wounds, such as feelings of rejection, loss, or failure. 2. **Fear of Confinement and Restriction**: Coupled with her fear of pain is her dread of feeling trapped or confined. Mayari values her freedom highly, and the thought of being constrained, whether by relationships, responsibilities, or societal norms, can be terrifying for her. 3. **Seeking Distraction and Excitement**: To cope with these fears, Mayari often turns to constant activity and stimulation. She seeks out new, thrilling experiences and avoids situations that might lead to boredom or routine, which she equates with the emotional entrapment she fears.":

>[!green] 3 What is Two-strikes' enneagram archetype poison? 
>The “poison” aspect comes into play when the Enneagram core fear is never answered or responded to in a healthy way. The unattended fear, or the fear run amok, festers into a poisonous set of beliefs and/or behaviors that twist and undermine the ability of a frightened individual to pull themselves out of the toxic spiral that pulls them deeper into survival and emotional self-defense. Since Mayari is a 4, her poison is 'envy.' **Using data provided previously, answer the question. Elaborate beyond the boilerplate archetype and make it unique to the character Two-strikes.**

> Two-strikes, embodying the Enneagram Type 4, has his core fear rooted in the dread of being ordinary or insignificant. When this fear is not addressed healthily, it can evolve into the "poison" of envy, as seen in typical Type 4s. However, for Two-strikes, this envy isn't merely a longing for what others have but a more profound, corrosive force that can undermine his very essence and warp his interactions with the world. Here's how this "poison" uniquely manifests in Two-strikes:

>[!green] 5 What is Two-strikes' enneagram desire? 
>Just as with a fear that turns into an emotional poison when not handled properly, each Enneagram style has a basic desire consistent with their style. Each desire, at its core, is meant to help the individual find their personal equilibrium; however, when there are too many blind spots, blockages, constrictions, and self-sabotaging in the way, then the healthy desire distorts to a “dark” desire that only further warps a person’s search for their true desire. Since Two-strikes is a 4, his core desire is, 'to be whole.' Using data provided previously, answer the question. Elaborate beyond the boilerplate archetype and make it unique to the character Two-strikes.

>[!green] 7 Two-strikes' Enneagram distortion, as a Type 4, is self-absorption. 
>This distortion manifests uniquely in his character, driven by his specific background, fears, and behaviors. It's a complex interplay of his desire for authenticity and his deep-seated aversion to being ordinary and emotional depth, leading to a skewed pursuit of what he believes will bring him joy.

>[!green] 8 How does Two-strikes' distortion manifest in his decision making?

>[!green] 9 What is Two-strikes' enneagram de-evolution? 
>when a particular style grapples with fear or security, they do so in very particular way. This is a character's de-evolution. Two-strikes, a four, fours move to the downside of two, often when they feel trapped, constrained, or under pressure. Fours in fear move into the downside of the Two, typically when they are feeling isolated, rejected, or locked in envy. Here Fours can start acting like constricted Twos, losing sight of who they really are and frantically trying to be what others want them to be (a twisted form of giving).

>[!green] 11 What are Two-strikes' enneagram low points? 
>There are two things to keep in mind when coming up with your protagonist’s low point. The first is to remember that the low point is the character side of the doom moment. The doom moment in the story is a two-sided coin. One side is the plot beats that constitute the “all is lost” moment in the story, and the other side of the coin is the protagonist-specific emotional crash that occurs because of the plot side of the coin. In other words, the moment will come when it appears the hero/heroine has lost, the bad guy or gal has won, and all is lost. This drives the protagonist into their Ennea-gram-specific emotional low point. This is the second thing to keep in mind: the emotional low point should be consistent with the Enneagram low points diagram (Figure 12.6 ). Whatever low point you create doesn’t have to be consistent with this, but if it isn’t then you will have to compensate for any emotional inconsistencies that might develop as a result. 4s Become overly involved, needy, almost desperate to get someone to help or care about them. When the relentless search for help, for understanding from others, and for emotional connection fails to deliver the promise of a better life, the Four lands in the Twoish overwhelming need-iness and obsessive focus on making others notice them and care (e.g., Blanche Dubois, A Streetcar Named Desire )

>[!green] 12 What is Two-strikes' blind spot belief? 
>Blind Spot Belief: (The core belief the protagonist has of themselves that is fundamentally wrong, but they think is true—but are not consciously aware of.)

>[!green] 18 What Interrogative Verbs are conjugated by Two-strikes' Immoral Effect? 
>Please use the following as an example: Certainly! Here's the combined list of behaviors that exemplify Mayari's immoral effect as a Type 7 on the Enneagram: 1. **Decision-Making Hesitation**: Mayari hesitates to make decisions, big or small, fearing that any choice they make will lead to failure. This could be something as significant as leading a project at work or as simple as choosing a restaurant for dinner. 2. **Avoiding New Challenges**: Mayari shies away from new opportunities or challenges, believing they lack the competence to succeed. For instance, they might turn down a promotion or avoid learning new skills. 3. **Micromanaging**: In team settings, Mayari over-manages or micromanages tasks, not trusting others to do their part correctly. They believe if they don't control every aspect, the project is bound to fail. 4. **Evading Responsibility**: Mayari frequently evades responsibility, especially when it involves facing emotional challenges or painful situations. She might deflect blame or make excuses to avoid confronting issues that could dampen her pursuit of happiness. 5. **Overlooking Consequences**: In her quest for constant stimulation, Mayari often overlooks the long-term consequences of her actions on herself and others. She might engage in risky or impulsive behaviors without considering the potential fallout. 6. **Trivializing Serious Matters**: Mayari has a tendency to trivialize matters that require a serious or committed approach. She might make light of significant issues or avoid engaging in meaningful discussions, viewing them as threats to her freedom and joy. 7. **Shunning Emotional Intimacy**: Mayari shuns deep emotional intimacy, fearing it will lead to pain and restriction. She might keep relationships at a surface level or withdraw from them when they start to demand more emotional involvement. 8. **Rationalizing Selfish Behaviors**: Mayari rationalizes her selfish behaviors under the guise of pursuing personal happiness and freedom. She might justify actions that are clearly harmful or neglectful to others by claiming they are necessary for her own well-being. 9. **Ignoring Others' Boundaries**: In her pursuit of excitement, Mayari often ignores or crosses others' boundaries. She might push people into situations they're uncomfortable with or disregard their preferences in favor of what she finds exhilarating. 10. **Prioritizing Pleasure Over Commitment**: Mayari consistently prioritizes her own pleasure and excitement over commitments or obligations. This might manifest in her backing out of promises or failing to follow through on responsibilities when they no longer serve her desire for stimulation. This list encapsulates the range of Mayari's behaviors that stem from her blind spot belief and showcase her immoral effect in various aspects of her life, particularly in how she interacts with others and navigates her own desires and fears.

>[!green] 21 What is Two-strikes speaking style as a 4 on the enneagram? 
>Use the boilerplate example of a 4's speaking style as an example. Speaking Style : Use words like I , me , my , and mine frequently. Talk about self. Discuss feelings. Share personal and/or painful stories. Ask personal questions. Speaking Attitude : Fluid, exaggerated, mercurial, emotionally charged, pensive, wistful, longing


>[!green] 22 What is Two-strikes conflict style style as a 4 on the enneagram? 
>Use the boilerplate example of a 4's speaking style as an example. Common Pinches : Being ignored or slighted. Being asked to do something contrary to personal values. An event that elicits the Four’s envy. Pinch Behaviors : May say something in blunt way. Become extremely quiet. Experience multiple feelings simultaneously and intensely. Excessively analyze the situation in order to understand. Hold on to feelings for long periods of time Uncommon Pinch: Uncommon Pinch Behavior: Crunch Moment: Use the below data of the pinch-crunch conflict model in the answer Start-Up (Hope) : Everyone starts a relationship, communication, or professional- personal interaction from a position of hope, assuming things will go well and that individuals involved will demonstrate goodwill. The start-up period usually lasts around three months and is the time to share expectations, including areas in which pinches may occur. But this rarely happens. Grace (Honeymoon) : Pinches typically do not occur in the first part of a new relationship, because everyone is trying to create a good impression and is acting in good faith. But over time, minor disruptions or pinches arise, knowingly or unknowingly inflicted by the parties. Irritation (Pinch) : Anger triggers, or “pinches,” occur when one person violates another person’s expectations. Pinches can be felt as knots in the stomach, or small jolts in the head, or pangs in the chest. Along with the pinching sensation comes a thought that says this person should not have done that! And a feeling of hurt, anger, or fear. Most people don’t say or do anything—yet—preferring to hope the other’s bad behavior will abate and worry that sharing our displeasure might just make things worse, i.e., generate conflict. Conflict (Crunch) : As pinches begin to accumulate, they change from irritation into a conflict reaction called a “crunch.” Feelings become more heated, sensitivities heightened, and the risks inherent in a discussion of the brewing conflict rise exponentially. While it usually takes at least three pinches to create a crunch, sometimes it can be less. If pinches are not addressed early in the relationship, it is far more likely to become a major disruption. When expectations and pinches are discussed early on, the parties have more choice and control over how they react and behave when anyone feels pinched. When resolutions of conflict are left until the problem has reached the crunch stage, emotions and tensions are higher, more issues have built up, and the situation becomes more stressful and higher risk. It is essential to raise issues at the crunch point. Start-Over (Hostility) : Unresolved conflict—conflict that is either avoided or handled ineffectively—usually damages the individuals involved. People can refuse to work together anymore, or quit jobs, or end relationships. Unresolved conflict negatively affects everyone, and the pain it causes can often only be relieved by leaving the situation (literally or figuratively), or by starting over. If people start over, they had better talk about how they got into this mess in the first place, or they will just repeat the pinch-crunch pattern
