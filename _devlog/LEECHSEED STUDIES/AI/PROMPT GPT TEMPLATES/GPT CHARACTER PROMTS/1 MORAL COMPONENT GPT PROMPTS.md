## core fear prompt

>[!orange] Core Fear Prompt Example for Mayari
>What is Mayari's core fear? Each of the Enneagram styles has a core fear that is consistent with their overall style (Figure 4.3 ). This fear reflects directly back to the focus of attention and the survival strategy. the core fear of each style reflects that style’s focus of attention and their survival strategy. Since Mayari is a (7), her core fear is Pain.  Provide several concepts that reinforce the theory of how core fear, focus of attention, and survival strategy are linked, and how these concepts can be expressed thru the character deveopment of Mayari within the story. 

## poison prompt
>[!orange] Poison Prompt Example for Mayari
> What is Mayari's enneagram archetype poison? The “poison” aspect comes into play when the Enneagram core fear is never answered or responded to in a healthy way. The unattended fear, or the fear run amok, festers into a poisonous set of beliefs and/or behaviors that twist and undermine the ability of a frightened individual to pull themselves out of the toxic spiral that pulls them deeper into survival and emotional self-defense. Since Mayari is a 7, her poison is 'gluttony.' **Using data provided previously, answer the question. Elaborate beyond the boilerplate archetype and make it unique to the character Mayari.**


## desire prompt
>[!orange] Desire Prompt Example for Mayari
>What is Mayari's enneagram desire? Just as with a fear that turns into an emotional poison when not handled properly, each Enneagram style has a basic desire consistent with their style. Each desire, at its core, is meant to help the individual find their personal equilibrium; however, when there are too many blind spots, blockages, constrictions, and self-sabotaging in the way, then the healthy desire distorts to a “dark” desire that only further warps a person’s search for their true desire. Since Mayari is a 7, her core desire is, 'to be happy.' Using data provided previously, answer the question. Elaborate beyond the boilerplate archetype and make it unique to the character Mayari.

### distortion prompt
>[!orange] Distortion Prompt Example for Mayari
>Mayari's Enneagram distortion, as a Type 7, is frenetic escapism. This distortion manifests uniquely in her character, driven by her specific background, fears, and behaviors. It's a complex interplay of her desire for happiness and her deep-seated aversion to pain and emotional depth, leading to a skewed pursuit of what she believes will bring her joy.
### de-evolution prompt
>[!orange] De-Evolution Prompt Example for Mayari
>What is Mayari's enneagram de-evolution? when a particular style grapples with fear or security, they do so in very particular way. This is a character's de-evolution. Mayari, a seven, Sevens move to the downside of One, often when they feel trapped, constrained, or under pressure. When they can’t escape the pain through fun, they will sometimes move into critical righteousness, micromanaging details and people and becoming their own form of perfectionists. Using data provided previously, answer the question. Elaborate beyond the boilerplate archetype and make it unique to the character Mayari.
### low points prompt
>[!orange] Low Points Prompt Example for Mayari
What are Mayari's enneagram low points?  The low point was well described in Chapter 12 . There are two things to keep in mind when coming up with your protagonist’s low point. The first is to remember that the low point is the character side of the doom moment. The doom moment in the story is a two-sided coin. One side is the plot beats that constitute the “all is lost” moment in the story, and the other side of the coin is the protagonist-specific emotional crash that occurs because of the plot side of the coin. In other words, the moment will come when it appears the hero/heroine has lost, the bad guy or gal has won, and all is lost. This drives the protagonist into their Ennea-gram-specific emotional low point. This is the second thing to keep in mind: the emotional low point should be consistent with the Enneagram low points diagram (Figure 12.6 ). Whatever low point you create doesn’t have to be consistent with this, but if it isn’t then you will have to compensate for any emotional inconsistencies that might develop as a result.Since she is a 7, the following are archetypal low points of sevens: Control obsessive/excessive behavior by becoming perfect and constrained, becoming righteous and blaming. Events destroy all the fun- loving, light-hearted, and pain avoidance of the Seven, leaving them stuck in Oneish judgment and righteousness agony Using data provided previously, answer the question. Elaborate beyond the boilerplate archetype and make it unique to the character Mayari.







>[!blue] Moral Component 1: ZAKU'S CORE FEAR
>
>This core belief that they are inherently incompetent and destined to make mistakes distorts Zaku's moral compass. It causes them to view the world as a threatening place where safety and competence are constantly at risk. This perception poisons their external relationships as they become overly focused on avoiding failure and seeking relief from their negative feelings. In doing so, Zaku may neglect the needs and well-being of others, justifying their actions as necessary for self-preservation. This blind spot can lead to a cycle of selfishness and desperation, where Zaku's actions, driven by fear, result in the very isolation and failure they dread.
>
Thus, Zaku's moral blind spot is not recognizing that this fear of incompetence is based on a misguided belief, and it is this belief that ultimately harms their relationships and moral judgment, rather than any real incompetence.

> what is zaku's de-evolution? definition: When dealing with fear, an individual’s behavior (de-evolution) typically becomes an accentuated version of the perceived negative qualities of that person’s Enneagram archetype. Zaku's perceived negative qualities are his immoral effect: avoidant, selfish, overly defensive. Zaku's enneagram archetype is 5. Fives move to the downside of Seven when all that thinking and figuring things out doesn’t work and the demands of others become too much; they abandon thinking altogether in an attempt to relieve the discomfort of their mental vapor-lock by trying to have fun. But this still doesn’t bring relief, and they can spiral into excess, lose their focus, and become mentally lost.

> **FEAR OF INCOMPETENCE**
> 
> "*I am inherently incompetent and constantly at risk of making disastrous mistakes.*"
> 
> Zaku's moral blind spot is an overwhelming **fear of incompetence**. This fear distorts their perception, leading them to view the world as inherently perilous, a place where failure is imminent. Consequently, Zaku's actions, driven by this fear, often become self-serving or frantic, as they seek to avoid the negative emotions associated with failure. This focus on self-preservation, rooted in a misguided belief in their own incompetence, adversely impacts their relationships and ethical decision-making. Essentially, Zaku's inability to recognize that their fear, rather than actual incompetence, is the root of their problems, constitutes their moral blind spot.

>[!green] IMMORAL EFFECT
**AVOIDANT, SELFISH, OVERLY DEFENSIVE**

*"If I don't handle it, it'll all go wrong."*
>
Zaku's immoral effect, stemming from their belief in their inherent incompetence, is likely to manifest in behaviors that are panicky, selfish, and overly defensive. 
>
Fearful of making mistakes, Zaku may become excessively controlling or avoidant in situations, not trusting others and trying to handle everything themselves. This can lead to a disregard for the needs and feelings of others, as Zaku is too caught up in their own fear of failure to consider the impact of their actions. In extreme cases, this could escalate to manipulative or deceitful behavior, as Zaku desperately tries to cover up mistakes or shift blame to avoid facing their perceived incompetence.

This pattern of behavior can hurt others around them, damaging relationships and creating a toxic environment.

> Zaku's dynamic moral tension is basically a tug-of-war inside them. They keep trying to control everything because they're secretly scared of messing up, but they don't realize this fear is the problem. This controlling behavior is starting to push people away and mess up relationships. So, the big issue for Zaku is whether to keep being controlling (which feels safe but is actually harmful) or to start letting go a bit and trust others (which is really scary for them because they think they'll mess up). The catch is, Zaku doesn't know that it's their hidden fear that's causing all this trouble.

what is zaku's low point? definition: Enneagram low points are a  pattern of decline and to these low points, because these are the places your characters have to land when they hit emotional rock bottom. Zaku's enneagram archetype is 5. Their emotional low point enneagram archetype de-evolution is to go from 5 to 7. The low point is expressed as 'Control obsessive/excessive behavior by becoming perfect and constrained, becoming righteous and blaming. Events destroy all the fun- loving, light-hearted, and pain avoidance of the Seven.' When thinking no longer works, fives run away from the pain, abandoning thinking altogether and numbing out with excess or obsession. The demands on the Five’s time, life, or emotions become increasingly oppressive, and their ability to think and figure out the world fails to bring them clarity or relief, so they bail into a Sevenish abandon to excess and numbness, leaving them unable to think or see clearly.

>Use the below data of the pinch-crunch conflict model in the answer
>
>Start-Up (Hope) : Everyone starts a relationship, communication, or professional- personal interaction from a position of hope, assuming things will go well and that individuals involved will demonstrate goodwill. The start-up period usually lasts around three months and is the time to share expectations, including areas in which pinches may occur. But this rarely happens. Grace (Honeymoon) : Pinches typically do not occur in the first part of a new relationship, because everyone is trying to create a good impression and is acting in good faith. But over time, minor disruptions or pinches arise, knowingly or unknowingly inflicted by the parties. Irritation (Pinch) : Anger triggers, or “pinches,” occur when one person violates another person’s expectations. Pinches can be felt as knots in the stomach, or small jolts in the head, or pangs in the chest. Along with the pinching sensation comes a thought that says this person should not have done that! And a feeling of hurt, anger, or fear. Most people don’t say or do anything—yet—preferring to hope the other’s bad behavior will abate and worry that sharing our displeasure might just make things worse, i.e., generate conflict. Conflict (Crunch) : As pinches begin to accumulate, they change from irritation into a conflict reaction called a “crunch.” Feelings become more heated, sensitivities heightened, and the risks inherent in a discussion of the brewing conflict rise exponentially. While it usually takes at least three pinches to create a crunch, sometimes it can be less. If pinches are not addressed early in the relationship, it is far more likely to become a major disruption. When expectations and pinches are discussed early on, the parties have more choice and control over how they react and behave when anyone feels pinched. When resolutions of conflict are left until the problem has reached the crunch stage, emotions and tensions are higher, more issues have built up, and the situation becomes more stressful and higher risk. It is essential to raise issues at the crunch point. Start-Over (Hostility) : Unresolved conflict—conflict that is either avoided or handled ineffectively—usually damages the individuals involved. People can refuse to work together anymore, or quit jobs, or end relationships. Unresolved conflict negatively affects everyone, and the pain it causes can often only be relieved by leaving the situation (literally or figuratively), or by starting over. If people start over, they had better talk about how they got into this mess in the first place, or they will just repeat the pinch-crunch pattern
