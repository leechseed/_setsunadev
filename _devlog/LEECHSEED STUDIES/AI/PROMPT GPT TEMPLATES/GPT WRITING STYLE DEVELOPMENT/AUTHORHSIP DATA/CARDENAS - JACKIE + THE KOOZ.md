Play. Pause. Rewind. Play. Pause. Rewind.
And on...and on....
It was routine at this point. The glow of the monitors. The dark-
ness of the cramped office. The lower back pain. The shitty stool.
The smell of the piss, beer, and cigarettes.
‘Was that...me?’ Jackie thought to himself, as he took a sharp in-
hale into his lungs, noticing the retched stench around him for the
first time.
The thought skipped through his mind and quickly out his ear. It
plonked on the cluttered desk and onto the greasy floor.
Jackie was in a state of self-medicated obsessive meditation. Every
thought that entered Jackie’s mind simply bounced between his
ears as he aimed focus to the security footage ahead of him.
‘How long has it been?’ Had it been hours? Days? Perhaps a
week. Time was irrelevant. He needed to know what happened.
Whatever it took. The answers were in the footage.
Play. Pause. Rewind.
Jackie fumbled for a pack of cigarettes. His left-hand dove in his
pants while his right made habitual counterclockwise circular mo-
tions on the security camera device. (Rewind).
In his once pressed dress slacks were, what felt like, his car keys.
Yep.
Sharp clanking. Attached to a large ring. Many metallic pieces....
the club keys. Yep. Still no cigarettes.
2
Fuck.
There. Close. Right? A metal rectangle. His zippo, and right next to
them were...bingo.
Touch. Navigating in the dark through one’s personal belongings.
A skill honed through four years of state college and a pension for
never wanting to leave.
While everyone left to pursue a life of normality, one of a 9
to 5 or a ‘career’ involving lines of code and oNbOardINg prO-
ceEdure....
Jackie stayed.
Jackie was always one to, ‘stay.’
For all intents and purposes Jackie was the only townie from his
graduating class. The only one left of his friends to be for sure.
Jackie tried, for sure, to join the generational workforce. A de-
gree beginning in “BS” will get you a job at any company with a
good enough reputation to earn a couple ‘likes’ and a ‘nice’ from a
couple old friends on social media.
But this? What Jackie does now? Mostly earns a side-eye, a
passing glance, and a head shaking disappointment.
‘He could have been someone,’ someone said in Jackie’s head.
“Motherfucker I am,’ Jackie mumbled out loud as he lit the tip of
his cigarette. With a whip, slip, and slap of his zippo, Jackie sum-
moned fuego and a nicotine rush.
An old routine, something that Jackie knew if he performed in
front of a crowd of undergrad females, at least one of them would
be a little impressed even if a bit disgusted with themselves.
3
Speaking of undergrads....
Jackie slapped the space bar. (Play.)
Nine cameras. But there’s a lot of them. 18 cameras to be exact.
Two old as fuck CRT TV screens with the big ass back and the cor-
nea killing rays filled the otherwise pitch-black manager office.
Unlike most ad-hoc retail security systems, (cheap as fuck, lob-
bied for the lowest dollar) this system was primo. For the time. At
least. Which, judging by the screens, had to be at least 98 years
old, according to Jackie.
In reality, the security system had to be at the most, ten years
old. The previous display monitors, however, are a different story.
2
In a tasteful irony, the brand-new screens were stolen about a
year ago. By the old general manager. The one that was fired for
fucking two, yes two, underaged females in the walk-in cooler.
First of all, what a nasty fuck. Second....at the same time? Third,
we don’t know. Because the sleezy fuck stole the monitors.
Legend has it that the old general manager was black mailed by
the two girls mere moments after he busted a fat nut.
As one girl spit the slime from her mouth, the other pulled out an
underaged ID.
Tit for tat, fast forward, the girls ask for the money in the safe.
Old GM walks calmly to the office, rips out the monitors, and runs.
10 days later, old GM is sitting on trial, subpoena obtained foot-
age played for the judge, and he’s taking a plea deal.

Enter stage left: our hero: freshly hired General Manager of The
Notorious Bullwinkle’s Tavern, Jackie Rube.
3
Jackie slapped the spacebar with his left hand. A stack of ash from
his cig falls between the keyboard’s keys. (Pause.)
His eyes were bloodshot. Not like, stock photo bloodshot, but
busted veins in both eyes, bloodlust bloodshot.
Nine cameras. On the left screen.
Nine cameras. On the right screen.
Displayed 3 by 3. Like a tic-tak-toe board.
You feel me? Good.
If a person would enter Bullwinkle’s from the main entrance and
exit through the back door, they would start at the top left and
exit bottom right. From MAIN ENTRANCE to BACK HALLWAY, and
finally DUMPSTER ALLEY.
Each camera was state of the art, for its time, where the quali-
ty of each camera was detailed enough for Jackie to make out in-
dividual characteristics of a certain person. If he squinted hard
enough and was at minimum 2 centimeters from said camera,
Jackie could spot you by that hideous neck tattoo, or how you
ended up with that sleezy fuckboy at the end of the night.
Jackie almost launched a side hustle off this pseudo-private-in-
vestigator-voyeur process. If, within 24 hours, you returned to
the club, before 8PM, and had $100 cash, Jackie could walk you
through the events of the previous night. Whether it was find-
ing proof of your boyfriend’s taste for freshmen pledges, or if you
5
should have called the cops on those guys your best friend walked
out with.
Jackie never went through with the scheme. Perhaps it was the
sleezy vibe. Or the possibility of being caught. Or maybe, it was
just the polish and veneer being ripped off the true nature of his
job. Jackie, at the end of the day, liked to think he was a decent
person if not a good person.
The man rarely got sleep. Especially during The Season. And
right now, here, at least he thought, we were Deep into The Sea-
son.
4
The Season runs from September - December. Maybe beyond if
the football team does well and moves to a championship, which
happens often.
Bullwinkle’s would be filled beyond capacity, a line out the front,
and across the street.
As a 16-year-old, Jackie and his friends would pile up in his old
mini-van and drive back and forth outside the club, just to salivate
at all the girls in line.
‘Imagine the girls that got in,’ said Young Jackie as he breathed
in through his mouth. He loved watching the girls cross the street.
Best part of the night for Jackie. If he could get in that sweet first
spot at the traffic light.
High-school girls were pathetic according to the perennial values
of Young Jackie.
College Girls. They were the big ticket. They were Women. They
6
were Class.
Oh, if Young Jackie could see Jackie of the Now.
Would he be proud?
Of the body count? Yes.
Of the current state of life? No.
Overall? Young Jackie would probably leave a rating of:
5/10 - Nice. I guess, but Fuck. Shit, man.
5
Jackie took his pale skinny meat fingers and rubbed his bloodshot
eyes.
He felt the persistent sting of the oil from his unwashed face cling
to the back of his eyelids.
The sharp peaks of jabbing pain from the latent cigarette smoke
drying the moisture from his eyes.
Jackie couldn’t tell if his eyes felt better. The rubbing was more
of a habit. Something to keep his mind off the present.
Jackie opened his eyes, and wiped blood, tears, a mixture of
both really, from his eyes.
From a blurred mess to some sense of clear vision.... back to the
security footage.
DUMPSTER ALLEY.
The back door SWUNG OPEN.
Valerie, 23, a new bartender, steps out for a cigarette.
She inhales deep, holds in, and breathes out. A cloud of smoke ex-
its her thin lips.
11
ly returned to a normal beat as the screens rewind through time.
Jackie didn’t care how far back he went. He let the wheel roll. Its
momentum rolling him to a more rational time.

OFF BAR - MIDDLE LEFT SCREEN CAMERA 5
22:24:39
Five Hours Earlier.
Jackie found himself. He was methodically squeezing himself
through the crowd to Valerie’s station, an off bar intended to pull
pressure off the main bar during the season. In reality, the off bar
is just as overwhelmed, a failed attempt at coping the thirst of
overworked college students.
The floor was packed. Sardines of skin, sweat, and debauchery.
Bad decisions, bad intensions, and bad nights swirled in a strong
mixed drink made from ‘Kooz.’ A concoction of food science chem-
ical bullshit and the dregs of the barely filtered bottom shelf an-
ti-freeze.
An open secret. Kooz was an upper, a downer, an all nighter, and
a helluva hang over. It’s the reason the kids came, and it’s the rea-
son they’ll feel like shit the next morning, why they’ll swear off it,
and why they’ll be back tonight.
While all the type-2 personalities were getting high off their shit
on synthetic kava and Martian kratom, in what Jackie considered
modern day opium dens, the other type, the ‘I want to get fucked-
up, or I need to live the college life” - type came to Bullwinkle’s.
12
The three-century old watering hole that will never, ever, close.
College has or hasn’t changed since Jackie was a freshman dorm
rat. Buildings get demolished, new ones pop up. Bars disappear,
and never come back. But only the townies notice those kinds of
changes.
Jackie was a ‘townie.’ Jackie used huff and gruff every time a no-
body would utter the words, ‘oh, so you’re a townie?’ But now,
older, and wiser, Jackie wears the slur as a badge of honor. He may
not be a trillionaire interplanetary corporate executive, but he
does have something that most people never get, an identity.
The average life cycle of any 18–21-year-old in this college town
is literally that. 18-21. You’re in, you’re out.
Fuck in, fuck off.
A four-year cycle that resets every year. Jackie’ll come in one day
asking if ‘so-so’ is running main bar tonight, and Valerie will cackle
at the question. Jackie loved and hated that cackle. It was, authen-
tic, so to speak. In corporate non-authentic jargon.
It was harsh laugh. A laugh that started with a guttural hock like
you’re about to hock a loogie. Then into a mid-town esh-esh that
finished into a SHA-SHA-SHA like facetiously pronouncing choco-
late like SHOCKlate.
Bartenders were usually burnt-out twenty-somethings with a
useless degree. Each still in denial of their present and hopeless
situation. Instead, they live in the past, relish in the never ending,
decently paying, and emotionally draining career of food service.
But eventually, that identity runs thin, and the bartender disap-
pears without a trace.
13
Tragic. Somehow, lost in their thoughts alone at night in the
dark, those poor hapless bartenders convince themselves they’re
becoming a ‘townie.’
Idiots. There’s no choice in the matter. You’re born a townie.
9
That’s right. Valerie.
Jackie came to. Back to the present. He’s now feet from the off
bar. Squishing himself through the crowd. At some point his dick
got throbbing hard. An unmistakable meat straw the thickness of
a clipper lighter.
It’s the kind of dick that when brushed against a girl she would
think, ‘is that...was that his?” rather than a general agreed upon
statement of fact.
Its most definitely due to the amount of unsolicited contact he’s
been put through. At this point, it doesn’t matter what touched
him, if it were flesh, his pelvic head would get excited.
The final push to the bar was closing fast, signified by the raised
arms flailing dollar bills in the air. A tradition that started even be-
fore Jackie’s time. Even before Kooz. Even before the drinking age
was raised.
The arms in the air were like a forest of meaty appendages sway-
ing chaotically in some sort of seizures mating dance that if cho-
sen, would be granted the sweet promise of a good time, maybe
even actually, getting laid.
The last push is the easiest, with arms in the air, movement be-
14
came more of a dance rather than brute force.
The bar. Jackie gripped the edge and guided himself to the bend
in the banister. Jackie knocked past at least seven pairs of tits full
smashed against the banister, fully on display, elbows jockying for
a feel.
‘Management, management, management...’ Jackie uttered un-
der his breath with the least bit of care if anyone even heard him.
Honestly, Jackie was taking his sweet time. Out the corner of his
eye, Ricky...or was it Rob...the new barback was in a panic behind
the bar. In the industry, they’d say Ricky Rob was, ‘in the weeds.’
No prioritization, dirty station, eyes glazed over, trying to do one
task, constantly being interrupted with a ‘I’ve been waiting for
10 minutes.... that’s not what I ordered,’ or ‘who the fuck hired
you?!’ Rick Rob was in a haze.
Still gripping the edge of the bar, Jackie rounded the corner into
the bar side.
Jackie, slightly amused, entirely frustrated, and pissed off at Val-
erie, watched as Ricky Rob stood frozen in time. His arms were
outstretched, above a set of plastic cups, filled with unidentified
liquids. Ricky Rob was caught in the middle of like six decisions.
‘What were these drinks? Who were they for? Should I take
those people’s tips? What are they asking for? What am I doing
here?’ plus a thousand other questions raced through Ricky Rob’s
head. Jackie saw it on the kid’s face. Poor boy was raining sweat
down the forehead. Jackie cracked a smile; he was about to be a
superhero.
15
“Ricky!” No response. Maybe Jackie wasn’t loud enough. Maybe
his name wasn’t Ricky.
“Rob!” Nothing. Shit.
“HEY! KID!” Jackie snapped his fingers several times, inches from
Ricky Rob’s face.
“Oh god, thank you!” Ricky Rob made a move, but Jackie’s stat-
ure was more than enough to box him in. Ricky Rob wasn’t going
anywhere.
“Please, boss, I need to get out of here. I don’t know...took too
many orders...made too many...” Ricky Rob’s voice shook, cracked,
and moistened as water rushed to his eyes.
It was dark behind the bar; you couldn’t really see much. To
Jackie however, everything was sensed through touch and experi-
ence. It didn’t take much to sense that this kid was about to toss
shit to the wind and quit.
Around Jackie, the chaos of unfulfilled orders was boiling to a
steady roll. The bar was a mess. Ricky Rob, perhaps just caught
in a bad situation, promised Valerie to cover the bar for a minute
for a smoke, was good natured, but about to disappear, and never
be heard from again, and to top it all off his ace at the off bar was
missing....
Management. This was his job. Time to earn his paycheck.
First Step: Assess.
One, two, three....at least 16 drinks made on the station. Taking
up space.
“What are these drinks? Who are they for?”
16
“I don’t know. I made them-” Ricky Rob was cut off.
Second Step: Plan.
Jackie took an arm and swiped the station clean. The cups fell to
the floor, liquid adding an inch to the already sticky mess.
Third Step: Action.
Jackie snatched a dollar from a hand, found the head attached
and leaned in to listen.
“Kooz’n’Coke!”
Jackie snatched a plastic cup from a container stack underneath
the bar. It was one of those off angle stack holders that stuck out
far enough that you could trip over the entire stack making a fool
out of yourself. At this level though, there were only about 10 cups
left.
“Box of cups on the fly!” Jackie yelled to Ricky Rob.
“A whole box?!” Ricky Rob yelled back, regaining a bit of compo-
sure.
“GO RICKY!” Jackie yelled as dug the cup in to the ice well.
Technically, the action of digging one’s cup into an ice well is a
health code violation. That is, if you didn’t realize that this entire
establishment is a health hazard. Jackie can’t remember the last
time a suit came in here. Jackie didn’t care.
All that mattered in that moment was holding the line.
Ice. Two pumps. Soda gun. One. Two. Straw. Stir. Done.
Jackie held out the drink, not even caring to look where he held
17
it out. With the other hand, Jackie wiped down the table surface,
and snatched another dollar.
‘K’n’C make it a double!’ One thing you can count on in this
town is the sheer unoriginality of drink choices. Maybe its cause
these kids were raised on Coke and Kooz, or maybe it’s just for the
sake of efficiency.
Jackie ran through the rest of the orders. Even comped a few
drinks for a couple of too-drunk-to-remember-but-I-ordered-a-
drink-and-never-got-its.
It might have been a few moments, maybe a few minutes, but
the rush was down and... low and behold here comes Rick Ross.
The kid was good. Didn’t utter a word just started restocking the
cups. Jackie liked the kid. Just need to figure out his name. And
maybe beat some sense into him.
“Kid, where’s Valerie?”
“She went out for a smoke, said she’d be back.”
“But she’s not.”
“Yeah,” The kid was disappointed. Ricky had a thing for her. May-
be he had a thing for women with direction. It hurts even more
when they promise something and don’t keep their word.
“I cleared the rush, but its gonna bounce back. I gotta find Val-
erie,” Jackie hollered as he wiped down the station again.
Ricky stood up, trying to dry wetness from the knees of his jeans
with a mass towel.
“Never kneel in this place, kid. But hey, I think you got it.”
18
Jackie leaned in close, tired of yelling. Perhaps he could turn
this into one of those ‘teachable moments.’
“The only way out the weeds, is through em. One drink at a
time.” Jackie patted Ricky’s shoulder.
“Yessir.” Ricky moved to the bar and snatched a dollar.
Jackie gripped the edge of the bar and started to ring around the
edge of it. But just before leaving,
“Hey kid, you hold for the rest of the night, you got full take on
tips.”
The kid smirked. Jackie couldn’t read him. Was it a ‘yea right’
smirk or a... fuck it Jackie didn’t care enough.
10
A flash of light. From above. Bright white, but only for a second.
Then another. As if two strikes of lighting illuminating a neon
night. Pay attention close enough and you might have seen the
dank, drab, and utterly uninspiring concrete bunker Bullwinkle’s
can be without the mysterious atmosphere of spinning dance
lights and darkness.
A roar rolled through the packed club, pierced with a few yelps
of intoxicated over-excitement. The night’s headliner was about to
hit the turntables.
Was it Friday? Jackie asked himself as he quickened his weaving
and winding through the ever-denser crowd. Shit.
In his peripheral, Jackie could see the front doors propping
open. Security just called it. We’re beyond capacity.
19
At this point, the floor has turned from a massive tin can of hu-
man sardines to an impenetrable single-minded oozing mass of a
single celled organism.
“WHTISUPBULLWINKLEESSS?!” The twang of a slurry drugged
out DJ’s unmistakable call to the masses rang out of the finely
tuned yet overpowered sound system.
On cue, the flesh amoeba shuddered from every inch of its exis-
tence. It opened its gaping maw responding to the call in a discor-
dant scream reminiscent of an Aztec army’s war call.
Claustrophobia does not help in these circumstances. For those
who unfortunately discovered their condition here, and now, the
best you can do is hang on to someone’s shoulders. Cause you’re
in for a ride. There’s no way getting out. Passing out on the floor
isn’t the best idea either. If you could control it.
The song faded in with the mid tones. A synthetic lead with a
simple melody that got the people going. The bass eases in. It
rolled rhythmically through the club. The amoeba jumped and
down, awkwardly trying to sync itself to the beat. Most of the
amoeba could hold a rhythm, the rest of the amoeba either just
didn’t give a fuck or, most likely, couldn’t give a shit.
The sheer mass leaving the floor and smashing into the ground
splashed the ever-present two-inch liquid layer of spilled booze,
piss, and bodily fluids into the shins of Jackie’s slacks. Jackie
couldn’t count how many pairs of Dockers he’s bought. He’s got an
auto-order set on some run of the mill work-pant site to drone de-
liver every six or so days.

Kooz, unlike traditional, hard to find, so expensive, real alcohol,
tends to be corrosive in large quantities. Fortunately, the shit goes
through your system like a fiber bar. Down the hatch and it hits
you quick, and hard. A feeling of euphoric stupidity. Big energy on
the upswing. A beat can take a hold of you and music sounds like
its pumped straight to your heart. The downswing feels like your
soul being ripped from your flesh. Your eyesight shudders in sync
with the music and a warm forced feeling of reflection and one-
ness overwhelms you. Before you have a second to articulate,
you’re shoved into the present on the upswing.
It’s like acid. Molly. Or good weed. Hits you in waves. Unfortu-
nately, unlike the previously mentioned drugs, the half-life break-
down of Kooz is a mere two-three minutes...scientifically speaking.
You can hit the killer crest of an upswing and just as you’re about
to be soul-ripped you come crashing down to sober soul killing re-
ality. What’s worse than getting a Kooz crash is having multiple in
the span of a moment. You gotta keep sipping. Gotta keep sippin
the Kooz to keep the wave rolling.
‘Quit sippin’ start dyin.’
Unlike BDSM or any form of kinky pain/pleasure dynamic, the
entire process of Kooz is physiological. The pain and pleasure dy-
namic of sadomasochism is based on overwhelming the nervous
system to where your mind is just incapable of processing all that
information. Your body is pushed to a point of ephemeral pres-
ence, eating up all that sensation to the point you can’t think, you
can only feel. To the point where feeling is all you want, all you
need. Pain. Pleasure. As long as you feel. People call this shit sub-
space. It’s incredible. A good dominant can take you there. No
21
drug can. It’s crazy. No wonder so many organized religious lead-
ers are into it.
Jackie dabbled in the kinky space for a bit. He liked it. But just
when things started to get good, the Gordian AI cult reared its
head. That was his cue to get out.
Drugs. Drugs are different.
