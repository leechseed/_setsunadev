# The purpose of this literature review regarding the Dragons of Stormwreck is to further elaborate on more concrete details regarding the inspirations of the fabula and theme

The American Dream has a correlation to the religious aspect of the Crusades and Christianity. Religion is so deeply tied into the foundation of what it means to be American, but it is also something that divides and incites violence. 

The idea here is to find a compelling story for Zaku, perhaps a character within the Knights Templar of the Crusades...and somehow tie it into the theme of America. 


What I have going right now is that the Moon is Jerusalem, the USSR are the Muslims while the US represents Christianity. ergo: Communism vs Capitalism

Here are the following books I will want to include in this literature review. 

Crusaders - Jones, Dan
The Templars - Jones, Dan

The Crusades - Asbridge, Thomas
The History of the Knights Templar - Addison, Charles G.
