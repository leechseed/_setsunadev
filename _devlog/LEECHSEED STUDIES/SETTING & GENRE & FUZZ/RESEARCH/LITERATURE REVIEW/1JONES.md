- **Strategic Failures and Crusading Dynamics**
  - Despite the Templars' establishment and Hugh of Payns' successful mission, the crusaders faced significant setbacks, notably in their attempts to capture Damascus. Strategic missteps, such as the dispersion of forces and underestimation of Muslim resistance, led to a humiliating retreat and reevaluation of crusading objectives.
    - These military failures highlighted the challenges of expanding Christian control in the Levant and underscored the importance of the newly established military orders in defending existing Crusader states rather than conquering new territories.

The Order's foundation signaled the emergence of a permanent, institutionalized presence in the Holy Land, dedicated to both military defense and spiritual warfare.
    - The Templars, alongside the Hospitallers, began to form the backbone of the crusader states' defenses, with their network of fortifications and commanderies extending throughout the Levant and Europe, ensuring a continuous flow of support and manpower.

- **Conclusion: The Templar Legacy and the Future of Crusading**
  - The Templar Order's rise under Hugh of Payns and the endorsement by Bernard of Clairvaux marked a significant shift in the crusading movement.

This movement, characterized by its ambitious scope and diverse leadership, showcased the intricate web of political, religious, and cultural motivations that propelled European powers towards the Holy Land. The narrative of this crusade intertwines the zeal of Bernard of Clairvaux, the political maneuvers of European royalty, and the pragmatic conquests of Sicilian forces, illustrating a multifaceted campaign that extended beyond the simple binary of Christian versus Muslim conflict.

- **Eleanor and Louis VII: A Royal Crusade Endorsement**
  - Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine's sharp contrast with her husband, King Louis VII of France, set a complex backdrop for their involvement in the crusade. Louis, initially groomed for the church, found himself in an uneasy marriage with the politically savvy Eleanor.
  - During the Christmas court of 1145 in Bourges, hints of Louis’s interest in crusading efforts were subtly revealed, leading to a formal endorsement of the crusade in the spring of 1146 through the reissuance of Pope Eugene's bull, *Quantum Praedecessores*, directly to Louis and his subjects.

- **Bernard of Clairvaux: The Crusade's Spiritual Beacon**
  - Bernard of Clairvaux emerged as the spiritual and motivational force behind the Second Crusade. His eloquent sermons and miraculous deeds, including healing the sick and conversing with a statue of the Virgin Mary, rallied support across Europe.

- **Sicilian Ventures in Ifriqiya**
  - Parallel to the spiritual mobilization for the Second Crusade was the pragmatic military expansion of Sicilian power in North Africa under King Roger II and his admiral, George of Antioch. Their campaigns, including the notable siege of Tripoli in 1146, were driven by economic incentives and the strategic aim of subjugating Muslim-ruled territories.

**The Second Crusade and the Baltic Expansion: A New Crusading Frontier**

As Europe rallied for the Second Crusade, motivated by the fall of Edessa to Muslim forces, a distinctive and self-interested strand of crusading emerged in Saxony. This movement, diverging from the main crusading efforts aimed at the Holy Land, targeted the pagan Slavic tribes known as the Wends in the Baltic region. This campaign reflects a broader interpretation of crusading, where territorial ambitions and religious zeal intersected, leading to a new front of Christian expansion under the guise of holy war.

- **Background and Motivation**
  - The Saxons, viewing their pagan Wendish neighbors as legitimate targets for conversion and conquest, sought to extend Christian dominion into the Baltic region. This effort was part of a long-standing tradition of Christian expansion that predated the formal institution of crusading.
  - The initiative for a crusade against the Wends was driven by both religious zeal and territorial ambitions, with the region's rich resources and strategic importance serving as key motivators.

- **Papal Endorsement and the Wendish Crusade**
  - Initially, Pope Paschal II had declined to authorize a crusade against the Wends. However, by 1147, the context had shifted, allowing for a broader interpretation of crusading endeavors. Pope Eugene III formally endorsed the campaign against the Wends through the bull *Divina Dispensatione*, equating it with the crusades in the Holy Land in terms of spiritual benefits and remission of sins.
  - Bernard of Clairvaux, a central figure in promoting the Second Crusade, supported the Saxon nobles' plan to wage war against the Wends, framing it as a battle against the enemies of God. He innovated with the introduction of a new symbol for the crusaders—a cross surmounted on a wheel—highlighting the unique nature of this campaign.

- **The Crusade's Progress and Impact**
  - The campaign against the Wends commenced in July 1147, with armies from Saxony and Denmark launching attacks into Wendish territories. These forces focused on burning pagan temples, forcibly converting the population, and extracting tributes from Wendish leaders for peace.
  - Despite the initial successes, the campaign faced limitations. Many converted Wends returned to their pagan practices, and peace agreements were often pragmatic, focusing on tribute rather than genuine religious conversion.

- **Legacy and Expansion in the Baltic**
  - The Wendish Crusade marked the beginning of nearly three centuries of conflict between Germanic Christian forces and the pagan tribes and kingdoms of the Baltic region. This campaign set a precedent for future crusading efforts in the area, leading to the gradual eradication of Wendish culture and the expansion of Christian dominion.
  - The crusade against the Wends illustrates the complexity of medieval crusading, where motivations extended beyond the simplistic narrative of Christian versus Muslim conflict, encompassing territorial, economic, and cultural ambitions within Europe itself.

The Wendish Crusade, as part of the broader Second Crusade, highlights the adaptable nature of crusading ideology, allowing for its application in diverse contexts. This campaign underscores the intersection of religious zeal with the political and territorial ambitions of the period, setting the stage for the expansion of Christendom into the Baltic and beyond.

The success of the siege bolstered Afonso Henriques' position and marked a significant milestone in the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula.

- **Broader Implications for the Second Crusade**
  - The conquest of Lisbon exemplified the Second Crusade's multifaceted nature, demonstrating how crusading ideology could be applied to various geopolitical contexts beyond the immediate goal of aiding the Latin states in the East.
