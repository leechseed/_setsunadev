**SECTION 4: Societal Adaptations**
- **In what ways have current societies built upon or diverged from the ruins of the past?** This examination reveals how societies have chosen to remember, ignore, or repurpose their historical legacy, reflecting on their values and priorities. (Rationale: This consideration encourages authors to reflect on the dichotomy of preservation versus progress, examining how societies choose to remember, ignore, or repurpose their history. It opens avenues for storytelling that delve into cultural identity, technological innovation, and the ethical dilemmas of using or forsaking the remnants of bygone eras.)
