- **Describe an ancient artifact and its origin.** How is it pivotal to your story? Artifacts act as narrative keystones that can unlock secrets, bestow power, or curse those who wield them, serving as focal points for quests or conflicts. (Rationale: Artifacts bridge the gap between the past and present, serving as key plot drivers or symbols within the narrative. Their origins and significance can unravel mysteries, bestow power, or curse characters, making them central to the unfolding story and character development.)
