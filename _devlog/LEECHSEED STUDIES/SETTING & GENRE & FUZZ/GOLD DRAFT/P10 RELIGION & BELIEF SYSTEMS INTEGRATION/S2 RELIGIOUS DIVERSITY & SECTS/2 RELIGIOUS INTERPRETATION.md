- **How do different societies or cultures practice this religion differently?** Practices vary significantly across regions. In the coastal regions, followers perform rituals at dawn to honor the sun's rise over the ocean. In contrast, desert communities celebrate the zenith, when the sun is at its highest and most powerful. This diversity showcases the religion's adaptability to different environmental and cultural contexts. (Rationale: The variation in religious practice across different cultures or societies emphasizes the adaptability and complexity of faith. It encourages an exploration of how geographical, historical, and cultural contexts shape religious expression, creating a more diverse and intricate world.)
