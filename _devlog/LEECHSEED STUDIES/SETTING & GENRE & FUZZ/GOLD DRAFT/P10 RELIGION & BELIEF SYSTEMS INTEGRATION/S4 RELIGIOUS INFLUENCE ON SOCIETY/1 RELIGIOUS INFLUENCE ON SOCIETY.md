**SECTION 4: Religious Influence on Society**
- **How does religion impact laws, governance, and daily life?** The Path of the Eternal Light deeply influences laws and governance, with many legal systems based on its teachings. Daily life is structured around solar events, such as prayers at dawn and dusk. Major decisions, like harvests and coronations, are scheduled according to the solar calendar, demonstrating the religion's pervasive influence on societal norms and behaviors. (Rationale: Religion's influence on laws and governance structures reveals its role in maintaining social order and moral standards. It affects every aspect of daily life, from legal systems to cultural rituals, highlighting religion's power to shape societal norms and individual behaviors.)
