- **What are the major religious festivals, rituals, and practices?** Significant festivals include the Solstice Celebrations, marking the longest and shortest days, and the Equinox Festivals, celebrating balance and harmony. Daily practices involve sun gazing at dawn for personal enlightenment and lighting candles at dusk to symbolize the sun's eternal light. These practices foster a sense of community and continuity. (Rationale: Detailing religious festivals and practices brings the belief system to life, providing rich settings for key narrative events and opportunities for character development. These rituals can foster community, serve as plot catalysts, or highlight cultural and religious tensions.)
