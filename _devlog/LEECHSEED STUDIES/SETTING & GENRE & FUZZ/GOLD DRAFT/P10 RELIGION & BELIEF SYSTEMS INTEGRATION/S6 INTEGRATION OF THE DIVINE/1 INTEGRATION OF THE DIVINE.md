**SECTION 6: Integration of the Divine**
- **How do deities or spiritual forces interact with the mortal world?** In this monotheistic system, the sun deity interacts with the world through natural cycles, influencing agriculture, climate, and human well-being. Divine messages are believed to be conveyed through Solar Oracles, while miraculous events are attributed to the deity's benevolence. These interactions are seen as proof of the sun's concern for humanity and its affairs. (Rationale: Divine interactions with the mortal world, whether through avatars, miracles, or oracles, offer dramatic narrative moments and pivotal plot developments. These interactions reflect the gods' personalities and influence, shaping the world's fate and characters' destinies.)
