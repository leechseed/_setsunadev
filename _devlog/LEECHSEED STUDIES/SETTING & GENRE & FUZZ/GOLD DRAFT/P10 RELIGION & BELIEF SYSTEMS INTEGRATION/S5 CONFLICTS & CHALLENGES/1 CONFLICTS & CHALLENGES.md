**SECTION 5: Conflicts & Challenges**
- **What conflicts arise from religious differences?** Conflicts often emerge between the sects of the Path of the Eternal Light and other belief systems that worship the moon or the stars, viewing them as rivals to

 the sun's supremacy. Within the main religion, doctrinal disputes between sects can lead to tension and, in extreme cases, schisms or religious conflicts. (Rationale: Religious differences are a potent source of conflict, driving narratives through ideological clashes, persecution, or holy wars. These conflicts add complexity and depth to the story, challenging characters' beliefs and loyalties.)
