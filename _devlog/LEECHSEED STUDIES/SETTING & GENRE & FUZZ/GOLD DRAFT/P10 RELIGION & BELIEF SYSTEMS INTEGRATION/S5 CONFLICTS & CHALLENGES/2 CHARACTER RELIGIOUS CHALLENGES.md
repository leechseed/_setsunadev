- **How do characters navigate religious challenges?** Characters navigate these challenges through personal journeys of faith, encounters with diverse beliefs, and sometimes, quests for religious truths or reconciliation between conflicting sects. Their paths reflect a broader exploration of faith, doubt, and the search for personal and communal peace. (Rationale: Characters' responses to religious challenges reveal their complexities and growth. Whether through faith, skepticism, or conversion, navigating these challenges can significantly influence their development and relationships.)
