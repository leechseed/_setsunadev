- **How did this belief system originate, and how has it evolved?** The Path of the Eternal Light originated from ancient sun worship and evolved over millennia into a structured faith with sacred texts, rituals, and a priesthood. Historical events, such as the unification of disparate tribes under a single solar deity and subsequent reformations, have shaped its current form, making it a complex blend of old traditions and new interpretations. (Rationale: Tracing the origins and evolution of the dominant belief system adds layers of historical depth and complexity to the world. It allows for exploration of past conflicts, schisms, and reforms that have shaped current beliefs and practices, highlighting the dynamic nature of faith and its profound impact on societal development and historical events.)
