**SECTION 4: Fantastical Elements**
- **Incorporate unique geographical features or phenomena.** Think beyond the natural to include elements that distinguish your world. (Rationale: Adding fantastical features or phenomena not only imbues your world with a sense of wonder and mystery but also opens up unique opportunities for storytelling. Whether serving as pivotal locations for quests, sources of magical power, or ancient mysteries to uncover, these elements invite exploration and adventure.)
