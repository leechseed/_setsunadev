**SECTION 6: Wilderness & Exploration**
- **Leave regions of your map unexplored or mysterious.** Designate areas that remain unknown or are shrouded in legend. (Rationale: Creating spaces of mystery within your map fuels the imagination and entices exploration. These uncharted territories promise adventure, danger, and discovery, serving as a canvas for new stories and challenges that keep the world vibrant and engaging for the audience.)
