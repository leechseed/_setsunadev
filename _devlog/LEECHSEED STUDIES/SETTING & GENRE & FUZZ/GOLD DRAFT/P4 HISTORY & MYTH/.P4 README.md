**Worldbuilding Worksheet for Authors: History and Myth**

**SECTION 1: Geography & Environmental History**
- **How have the geographical features of your world been shaped by historical events?** Consider how natural disasters, wars, or magical events have permanently altered the landscape, serving as a testament to the world's history and affecting its future development. (Rationale: This encourages authors to weave a rich tapestry of history into the very geography of their world, creating a more immersive setting by linking geography and history. It allows for the exploration of how past events continue to influence present and future societal and environmental conditions.)

**SECTION 2: Societal Development & Historical Conflicts**
- **What major historical conflicts have shaped the societies in your world?** Reflect on the wars, revolutions, or major disputes that have defined cultural values, social structures, or alliances/enmities within your societies. (Rationale: This approach helps create a world where current tensions and alliances are deeply rooted in historical conflicts, enriching the narrative depth and providing characters with complex backgrounds and motivations shaped by their society's history.)

**SECTION 3: Lost Civilizations & Their Legacies**
- **Can you identify a lost civilization in your world, and what led to its downfall?** Explore the reasons behind the civilization's demise, such as environmental catastrophe, war, or societal collapse, and how its legacy continues to influence the world. (Rationale: This prompts authors to incorporate elements of mystery and exploration into their world, offering readers and characters alike the chance to uncover the past and its impact on the present. It allows for the exploration of themes like the cyclical nature of history and the lessons that might be learned from past societies.)

**SECTION 4: The Role of Legendary Heroes**
- **Who are the legendary figures in your world, and how do they influence current events?** Detail the deeds and misdeeds of these figures, exploring how their legacies live on through stories, cultural practices, or even magical legacies. (Rationale: This direction encourages authors to create characters whose historical actions continue to ripple through time, affecting current events and cultural perceptions. These legendary figures can serve as the basis for quests, conflicts, or moral lessons within the narrative.)

**SECTION 5: Integrating Player/Character Histories**
- **How can characters’ personal histories be intertwined with world history?** Discuss how characters' ancestries, past actions, or affiliations with historical events or figures significantly impact their roles in the current world. (Rationale: This aims to make characters feel integral to the world, fostering deeper connections and a sense of belonging or conflict with the setting. It enriches character development by tying personal stories to larger historical narratives and societal currents.)

**SECTION 6: Cultural Artifacts & Relics**
- **What artifacts from past civilizations or legendary figures are still significant?** Examine the origins, powers, and roles of these artifacts in the current setting, considering how they influence power dynamics, cultural values, or quests. (Rationale: This discussion helps authors create plot hooks and objectives deeply embedded in the world's history, offering tangible links to the past that characters can discover, utilize, or fight over, thereby driving the narrative forward.)

**SECTION 7: Incorporating Real-World Inspirations**
- **How can real-world historical events inspire the events in your world?** Look at how parallels with real history can provide a foundation of realism and relatability, while also allowing for creative adaptation and the exploration of "what if" scenarios. (Rationale: This encourages authors to draw on the rich tapestry of real-world history to inform their worldbuilding, providing a sense of realism and depth while offering the flexibility to adapt and reimagine historical outcomes in a fantasy setting.)

**SECTION 8: Legends & Their Consequences**
- **What are the consequences of disturbing ancient sites or artifacts?** Explore the potential repercussions of such actions, ranging from awakening ancient evils to triggering political upheaval or environmental disasters. (Rationale: This adds a layer of caution and consequence to the exploration and interaction with the ancient world, challenging characters to weigh the risks and rewards of delving into the past. It serves as a narrative device to introduce tension, conflict, and moral dilemmas into the story.)

**SECTION 9: Conclusion: Reflecting on History’s Impact**
- **Reflect on how history and legends shape the identities, conflicts, and aspirations of your world’s inhabitants.** Consider how the collective memory and interpretation of the past influence current societal norms, values, and goals. (Rationale: This final reflection ensures that the historical and mythical elements crafted are not merely background information but actively influence the narrative, character development, and the world's evolving story. It encourages authors to weave history and mythology into the fabric of their worldbuilding, enriching storytelling with depth and coherence.)
