**SECTION 4: Creative Exploration within Limits**
- **Identify Less Explored Aspects:** Look for areas within the universe that have not been fully developed or explored.

(Rationale: Targeting underdeveloped areas of the universe offers room for creativity and innovation, allowing for expansion that enriches the narrative landscape without conflicting with primary storylines.)
