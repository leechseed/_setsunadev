- **Adaptation and Expansion Strategies:** Employ strategies that thoughtfully expand the lore and world, ensuring that new elements feel organic and integral to the universe. This includes developing backstories, introducing new settings, or expanding the mythology. (Rationale: Careful consideration in how the universe is expanded ensures that additions are perceived as natural extensions of the original work, enhancing narrative cohesion and deepening audience immersion.)
