**SECTION 6: Symbols & Recognition**
- **What symbols or signs represent the guild?** Create identifiable marks of the guild's presence and membership. (Rationale: Symbols and emblems serve as a visual shorthand for the guild's identity, values, and influence. They enhance the world's cultural texture and can play key roles in the narrative, symbolizing allegiance, heritage, or conflict.)
