**SECTION 1: Cult Foundation**
- **Choose a Deity or Philosophy:** Decide whether your cult is focused on the worship of a specific deity, a set of deities, or follows a unique philosophy or set of beliefs. This choice will influence the cult's motivations, rituals, and societal interactions. (Rationale: Identifying the core belief system or deity provides a foundation for the cult's identity, shaping its goals, practices, and role within the wider world.)
