**Worldbuilding Worksheet: Integrating Technology in Fantasy Worlds**



**SECTION 1: Technologies of Motion**
- **Describe the primary methods of transportation and communication in your world.** Explore how these methods, whether traditional, magical, or technologically advanced, facilitate movement and information exchange across your world. This exploration helps establish the logistical and narrative framework within which characters operate, affecting how quickly they can travel and communicate. (Rationale: These technologies impact the pace and scope of the story, shaping interactions and plot development. By determining the speed of travel and the flow of information, authors can strategically design plot pacing and character interactions, influencing the overall narrative structure and tension.)

- **Consider the limitations and unique features of your world's transportation.** Reflect on how geographical barriers, technological constraints, and magical conditions might limit or enhance these methods. This consideration allows for the creation of challenges and opportunities within your story, shaping societal development and individual experiences. (Rationale: These features influence societal structure and daily life, understanding the practical implications of technological choices. Recognizing these limitations and features ensures a more dynamic and realistic world, where transportation and communication technologies directly affect societal organization, daily routines, and the characters' strategies for overcoming obstacles.)



**SECTION 2: Technology of Knowledge**
- **How widespread is literacy in your society, and who controls knowledge?** Delve into the distribution of literacy and education across your world, examining who holds the power to disseminate knowledge and how this influences social hierarchies and power dynamics. (Rationale: Defines power dynamics and cultural values related to education and information. The control over knowledge and literacy plays a crucial role in shaping societal structures and ideologies, impacting character motivations and the accessibility of information for both characters and readers.)

- **What is the role of printing or other forms of knowledge dissemination?** Investigate how your society shares and preserves knowledge, whether through printing, magical archives, or oral traditions. This analysis will reveal the dynamics of cultural transmission and the evolution of knowledge over time. (Rationale: Allows consideration of how ideas spread and evolve within the world. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for building a believable and complex society where the dissemination of knowledge can lead to innovation, conflict, and the shaping of public opinion and cultural values.)



**SECTION 3: Technologies of Warfare**
- **Detail the technological disparities between elite warriors and common soldiers.** Examine how access to advanced weaponry or magical artifacts creates a divide in combat capabilities, reflecting on the social and political implications of such disparities. (Rationale: Informs the world's military strategies and the social status of different warrior classes. Highlighting the differences in equipment and training between various military echelons allows for a nuanced exploration of warfare, honor, and social mobility within the world.)

- **How do unique or magical elements integrate with warfare technology?** Explore the intersection of magic and technology in your world's military applications, considering how this blend affects tactics, battlefield outcomes, and the balance of power. (Rationale: Prompts the creation of distinctive combat systems that add depth to conflicts. The integration of magical elements into traditional warfare technologies can introduce novel strategies and ethical dilemmas, enriching the narrative with complex battles and moral questions.)




**SECTION 4: Technology of Life**
- **Describe the technologies surrounding food production and medicine.** Assess the role of technological innovations and magical interventions in sustaining life, from agricultural practices to healthcare. This evaluation helps construct a detailed picture of everyday survival and well-being in your world. (Rationale: Balances between magical and mundane means and their availability to social classes, crafting a believable living environment. Understanding these aspects is essential for creating a world where the realities of food scarcity, disease, and healthcare influence social structures, character development, and plot challenges.)

- **How do agriculture & medical practices affect population centers and adventurers?** Consider the implications of your world's food and health technologies on urban development, population density, and the risks and resources available to characters exploring the world. (Rationale: Guides in designing realistic challenges and resources for characters. The availability of food and medical care plays a critical role in shaping settlements, determining migration patterns, and affecting the viability of long journeys or quests, thereby impacting the narrative possibilities for adventure and exploration.)




**SECTION 5: Unobtainium & Rare Materials**
- **Identify any unique substances in your world.** Detail the extraordinary materials that exist within your world, discussing their properties, origins, and roles in society, technology, and magic. (Rationale: Discussing rare materials adds wonder and drives quests or conflicts, considering their properties and uses. The introduction of unique, powerful substances can serve as a focal point for quests, power struggles, and scientific or magical breakthroughs, enriching the world with elements of mystery and contention.)

- **How do you balance the power provided by these materials without overshadowing character abilities?** Strategize ways to incorporate these rare materials into your world without making them a panacea or diminishing the importance and agency of character skills and decisions. (Rationale: Ensures

 the world remains challenging and engaging for characters at all levels. Careful consideration of how these materials interact with character abilities and the world's balance of power ensures that stories remain compelling and characters' talents and growth retain their significance.)




**SECTION 6: Controversial Technologies**
- **If your world includes gunpowder or similar advancements, how do they impact societal and military structures?** Reflect on the societal upheaval and shifts in warfare tactics brought about by such technologies, and how they redefine power dynamics and conflict within your world. (Rationale: Addresses the integration of technologies that may shift fantasy settings towards modern or industrial eras. The introduction of game-changing technologies like gunpowder can dramatically alter the course of history and societal development in your world, offering new avenues for storytelling and character conflict.)
