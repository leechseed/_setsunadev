**SECTION 1: Technologies of Motion**
- **Describe the primary methods of transportation and communication in your world.** Explore how these methods, whether traditional, magical, or technologically advanced, facilitate movement and information exchange across your world. This exploration helps establish the logistical and narrative framework within which characters operate, affecting how quickly they can travel and communicate. (Rationale: These technologies impact the pace and scope of the story, shaping interactions and plot development. By determining the speed of travel and the flow of information, authors can strategically design plot pacing and character interactions, influencing the overall narrative structure and tension.)
