**SECTION 4: Economy & Resources**
- **What are the economic foundations of your society?** Identify the key industries, resources, and trade practices that sustain your society. (Rationale: The economic underpinnings of a society inform the social hierarchy, wealth distribution, and daily life of its people. This knowledge allows for the crafting of narratives centered around economic disparity, resource-driven conflicts, and characters' pursuits of prosperity or survival.)

**SECTION 5: Social Dynamics & Mobility**
- **How does social mobility work within your society?** Discuss the factors that enable or restrict movement within the social hierarchy. (Rationale: Exploring social mobility mechanisms sheds light on the aspirations, frustrations, and dynamics of character development. It highlights the barriers faced by individuals, fostering stories of struggle, ambition, and the quest for recognition or power within the societal structure.)
