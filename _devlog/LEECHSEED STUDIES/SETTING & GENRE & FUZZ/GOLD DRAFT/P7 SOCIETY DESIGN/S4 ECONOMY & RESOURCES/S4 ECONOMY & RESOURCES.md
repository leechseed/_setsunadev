**SECTION 4: Economy & Resources**
- **What are the economic foundations of your society?** Identify the key industries, resources, and trade practices that sustain your society. (Rationale: The economic underpinnings of a society inform the social hierarchy, wealth distribution, and daily life of its people. This knowledge allows for the crafting of narratives centered around economic disparity, resource-driven conflicts, and characters' pursuits of prosperity or survival.)
