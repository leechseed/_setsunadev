```

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Explicit Description**: The narrator directly states the character's qualities without ambiguity.
  - **Narrator's Insight**: Provides the reader with the narrator's perspective on the character.
  - **Clear Traits**: Leaves little room for interpretation, ensuring the reader understands the character's attributes.

###### **Examples of Direct Characterization**

- "John was a brave and honorable knight."

##### **Indirect Characterization**

- **Definition**:
  - A technique where the character's traits are revealed through their actions, dialogue, thoughts, appearance, and interactions with other characters, allowing readers to infer their personality and motivations.

```mermaid

    A[**Indirect Characterization**]
    A --> B[**Actions**]
    A --> C[**Dialogue**]
    A --> D[**Thoughts**]
    A --> E[**Appearance**]
    A --> F[**Interactions**]
```

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Actions**: What the character does, which reflects their personality and motivations.
