### **1. Title: McKee's Three Acts Model**

#### **1.1. Definition**

McKee's Three Acts Model, as detailed in his seminal book **"Story,"** presents the **three-act structure** as a timeless framework essential for storytelling. This structure divides a narrative into three distinct parts: **Setup**, **Confrontation**, and **Resolution**. Each act serves a specific purpose in developing the story, ensuring a coherent and engaging progression that maintains the audience's interest from beginning to end.
