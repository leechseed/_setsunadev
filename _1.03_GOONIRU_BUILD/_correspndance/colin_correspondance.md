*Colin sent me a copy of 'TIS Pity She's a WHORE by JOHN FORD in reference to a phone call we had earlier that day. Something along the lines of how surprise and creativity must align in a way that is subversive in a way that sparks the curiosity and not the putrifactory senses of the chat.*

**MY RESPONSE**

I was not ready for the WHORE in all caps. Brilliant.
I could see this adapted into a new media theatre.

The setup is a Zoom call (at least for the first part) between a Roman Catholic priest (friar) and  Giovanni, akin to a “remote confessional” (e.g., "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned," etc.)....there's a little bit of tongue in cheek here that hooks well early.

However, instead of being a video uploaded to YouTube—something I've seen attempted yet fail to really capture an audience....well I guess except for that Starkid guy who was on Glee for a bit...anyway—this would be different. The 'playfession'  would be a live-streamed on Twitch as a zoom call. Hypermediated intertextual adaptation. The show will run live for two weeks, Thursday through Sunday (matinee perhaps with understudies etc) just like community theatre but as...Twitch live-streamed community theatre.

You could really frame the concept as an intertexual study on the efficacy of traditional community theatre production methodology applied to a hypermediated new media concept big hard penis words for academie.

I still need to go through the rest of the play, but regardless, the concept itself is a fascinating concept to explore.

Live streaming and YouTube are two distinct forms of media, and both lack something I personally love about theatre—especially in community theatre—the repetition. There's something compelling about a scripted performance that’s meant to be exactly the same each time but inevitably varies in subtle ways with each performance.

Perhaps this could work as a dissertation topic for ya Dr. Wulf? I hear the bells tolling in Berlin and I can tell they're ringing form the 'good side' of the wall.  I’d be glad to flesh out the technical aspects if you believe it could be a limitation. If nothing else, one could craft a research proposal for that sweet sweet turgy dabloons before they go out of season fore winter is coming.  I believe it will captivate academia for a while—particularly professional Dranarraturtologists. It’s something fresh for them to analyze and discuss in pursuit of testicular tenure.

Also, just, if you're interested and FYI, I'm going to CC this into a discord direct message.
For me, I'm pretty much on disc 24/7, but I rarely check the email. 
If you so incline we can move it there? If not I'm happy to stay put hereth, WHORE.

# A Narratological Analysis of John Ford's "'Tis Pity She's a Whore"

## Abstract

John Ford's **"'Tis Pity She's a Whore"** is a provocative tragedy that delves into themes of forbidden love, morality, and societal taboos. This paper provides a comprehensive narratological analysis of the play, examining its narrative structure, characterization, temporal manipulation, and thematic explorations. By applying key concepts from narratology, such as Gérard Genette's narrative discourse and Seymour Chatman's story and discourse framework, the analysis uncovers how Ford's narrative techniques enhance the play's dramatic impact and thematic depth.

## Introduction

Published in 1633, John Ford's **"'Tis Pity She's a Whore"** stands as one of the most controversial plays of the early modern period, primarily due to its central theme of incestuous love between siblings Giovanni and Annabella. The play challenges moral conventions and explores the complexities of human desires against the backdrop of Renaissance society. This analysis adopts a narratological perspective to dissect the narrative mechanisms Ford employs to engage the audience, provoke thought, and elicit emotional responses.

Narratology, the study of narrative and narrative structure, provides a robust framework for examining how stories are constructed and how they function. By applying narratological theories, particularly those of Gérard Genette and Seymour Chatman, this paper explores the intricacies of Ford's narrative techniques, including focalization, temporal structure, and character development.

## Narrative Structure and Plot Organization

### Story and Discourse

Seymour Chatman's distinction between **'story'** (the content or chain of events) and **'discourse'** (the expression or means by which the content is communicated) is fundamental to understanding the narrative structure of the play. Ford's story revolves around the illicit relationship between Giovanni and Annabella, their struggle with societal norms, and the ultimate tragic consequences of their actions.

The **discourse** of the play—the way the story is told—is crafted through a combination of dialogue, soliloquies, and dramatic irony. Ford manipulates the audience's perception by controlling the flow of information, allowing certain characters' thoughts and intentions to be known while others remain obscure.

### Temporal Structure

Gérard Genette's concepts of **order**, **duration**, and **frequency** are essential in analyzing the temporal aspects of the narrative.

- **Order**: Ford maintains a largely linear progression of events but employs **analepses** (flashbacks) through characters' recollections to provide background information and context. For example, references to Giovanni's time at the university and his previous reputation establish his character's transformation.
  
- **Duration**: The pacing of the play varies, with some scenes accelerating the action through rapid dialogue and others slowing down to focus on introspection, particularly in Giovanni's soliloquies as he grapples with his forbidden desires.

- **Frequency**: Certain themes and motifs recur throughout the play, such as the conflict between passion and reason, enhancing the narrative's cohesion and emphasizing the central moral dilemmas.

## Focalization and Point of View

Genette's theory of **focalization**—the perspective through which the narrative is presented—is pivotal in understanding how Ford aligns the audience with particular characters.

- **Internal Focalization**: The play frequently employs internal focalization through Giovanni's perspective. His soliloquies reveal his inner turmoil, justifications, and rationalizations for his actions, inviting the audience to empathize with his plight despite the moral transgressions.

- **External Focalization**: At times, the narrative shifts to an external viewpoint, especially during scenes involving other characters like the Friar or Annabella's suitors. This shift allows the audience to perceive the broader societal context and the impending consequences of the protagonists' actions.

By manipulating focalization, Ford creates a complex interplay of sympathy and judgment, forcing the audience to navigate their moral responses to the characters.

## Characterization and Thematic Development

### Propp's Functions and Spheres of Action

Applying Vladimir Propp's morphology of the folktale, we can identify certain narrative functions and character roles within the play.

- **Hero (Giovanni)**: Though unconventional, Giovanni serves as the protagonist whose desires drive the narrative forward.
  
- **Donor (Friar)**: The Friar provides guidance and warnings, embodying the moral compass of the narrative.

- **Princess (Annabella)**: She is both the object of Giovanni's desires and an active participant in the forbidden relationship.

The inversion of traditional roles and functions highlights the play's challenge to conventional morality and narrative expectations.

### Character Complexity

Ford's characters are multi-dimensional, aligning with E.M. Forster's concept of **'round characters'** who exhibit complexity and undergo development. Giovanni transitions from a celebrated scholar to a man consumed by forbidden passion, illustrating the internal conflict between intellect and desire.

Annabella evolves from innocence to complicity, and ultimately to remorse, reflecting the consequences of transgressing societal norms. The Friar represents the voice of reason and religion, yet his inability to dissuade Giovanni underscores the limitations of moral authority.

## Themes and Motifs

### Forbidden Love and Transgression

The central theme of incestuous love serves as a vehicle to explore broader questions about the nature of desire, morality, and societal constraints. The narrative compels the audience to confront uncomfortable ethical dilemmas, reflecting Roland Barthes' idea of the text as a site of plurality and open interpretation.

### Conflict Between Passion and Reason

The tension between Giovanni's intellectual reasoning and his overwhelming passion embodies the classic struggle between **logos** and **eros**. The narrative delves into the justifications Giovanni constructs, showcasing the human capacity for self-deception when driven by desire.

### Inevitable Tragedy

The play adheres to the tragic structure outlined by Aristotle, where the protagonist's **hamartia** (tragic flaw) leads to his downfall. Giovanni's inability to suppress his forbidden love sets the course for the inevitable tragic conclusion, fulfilling the cathartic function of tragedy by eliciting pity and fear.

## Narrative Techniques

### Dramatic Irony

Ford employs dramatic irony to heighten tension, as the audience is often aware of information unknown to certain characters. This technique intensifies the emotional impact, particularly as characters make decisions that propel them toward their doom.

### Symbolism and Imagery

The recurring imagery of light and darkness symbolizes knowledge and ignorance, purity and corruption. The use of religious references and metaphors accentuates the moral conflict and the sacrilegious nature of the protagonists' relationship.

## Conclusion

John Ford's **"'Tis Pity She's a Whore"** is a rich text for narratological analysis, offering intricate narrative structures and profound thematic content. Through the application of narratological theories, we gain deeper insights into how Ford constructs the narrative to challenge and engage the audience. The play's exploration of forbidden love, the conflict between passion and reason, and the utilization of complex characters and temporal manipulation underscore its enduring relevance and dramatic power.

By dissecting the narrative mechanisms at work, this analysis highlights the sophisticated craftsmanship of Ford's writing and contributes to a greater understanding of the play's impact within the canon of English literature.
