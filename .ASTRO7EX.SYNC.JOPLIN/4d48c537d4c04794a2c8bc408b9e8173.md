## Purpose
Give you a **hard, practical governance mechanism** for creative work at any scale—dialogue line, scene, arc, season, entire world—without pretending the domain isn’t wicked and chaotic.

---

## Core Concept
**Invariants** are **constraints on meaning** that must remain true across every scale of the IP:
- True in a **line of dialogue**
- True in a **character arc**
- True in the **world history**
- True in the **systems** (economy, politics, tech, religion, violence, institutions)

If an idea violates an invariant, it dies—even if it’s cool.

---

## Step 1 — Define Your Non-Negotiable Invariants (3–5)
### Rules
- Max **3–5**. If you write 12, you wrote “preferences,” not invariants.
- They are **not lore facts** (“the city has 7 districts”).
- They are **meaning constraints** (“power always has a cost”).
- Each invariant must be:
  - **Speakable** (can appear as dialogue)
  - **Playable** (can shape choices/actions)
  - **Historical** (can explain why the world became what it is)
  - **Systemic** (creates feedback loops and consequences)

### Example Invariant Formats
- “Power always has a cost.”
- “Memory is unreliable.”
- “Systems outlive people.”
- “Identity is performative.”
- “Violence solves problems but creates rot.”

---

## How Invariants Prevent Scale Drift
Scale drift happens when:
- Micro-writing (lines/scenes) starts optimizing for local coolness
- Macro-worldbuilding optimizes for encyclopedic accumulation
- The two stop agreeing on what the story *means*

**Invariants are your compatibility layer.**
They let you make *any* addition—character, faction, tech, event—and immediately test:
- Does this deepen the invariant?
- Does it challenge it in a way that still confirms it?
- Or does it contradict the invariant (therefore breaking the IP’s meaning)?

If it contradicts, you cut it—no debate, no cope.

## A Simple Governance Loop (So Your “Mania Muse” Doesn’t Drive Off a Cliff)
You don’t suppress the Dionysian drive. You **timebox it** and **hand it off** to a governor.

### Loop
1. **Diverge (Dionysian / Mania Muse)**  
   Generate options fast. No judgment.
2. **Converge (Apollonian / Editor)**  
   Apply invariants as a kill-filter.
3. **Integrate (Systems Thinking / Architect)**  
   Ask: what does this change cause elsewhere? (second-order effects)
4. **Commit (Operator / Producer)**  
   Lock the decision into canon and move forward.

### The Governor Rule
The governor is not “a vibe.” It’s your invariants.  
**Invariants set pace. Muse supplies material.**

---

## Scaling From Sentence → Scene → Season → World
Use the same invariant test at every level.

### 1) Sentence / Dialogue
A line is “on-IP” if it either:
- states an invariant,
- implies it,
- or contradicts it in a way the story will punish/correct.

**Test:** “Could this line exist in a different IP with different invariants?”  
If yes, rewrite it until it could not.

### 2) Scene
A scene earns its existence if it:
- forces a choice where **invariants impose cost**
- or reveals an invariant through consequences

**Test:** “If I removed this scene, would an invariant be less true?”

### 3) Arc / Season
An arc works if it:
- escalates pressure on invariants
- increases systemic consequences (feedback loops, blowback, compounding costs)

**Test:** “Does the arc *tighten* the invariant, or does it dilute it with side-quests?”

### 4) World / Lore
Worldbuilding is valid if it:
- is a machine that **makes invariants inevitable**
- produces recurring outcomes that confirm meaning

**Test:** “Does the world *enforce* the invariant even when characters resist?”

## Synergy: MCDP Doctrine + Systems Thinking
Marine doctrine is useful here because it’s built for **uncertainty, friction, and changing conditions**—which is exactly your wicked creative field.

### 1) Doctrine as “Invariants” (Commander's Intent)
MCDP-style thinking emphasizes guiding action with **purpose and intent** rather than brittle scripts. That maps cleanly to your invariants: they are your IP’s “commander’s intent” for meaning.  
- MCDP 1 **Warfighting** frames a philosophy of war and decision-making under uncertainty. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### 2) Planning as a Conceptual Framework (Not a Perfect Script)
MCDP 5 **Planning** explicitly treats planning as preparation for an uncertain future, not prediction. That matches how you should treat narrative planning: you plan to **adapt**, not to “lock the universe.” :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 3) Campaigning = Linking Tactics to Strategy (Micro to Macro)
MCDP 1-2 **Campaigning** is basically “how to connect many smaller actions to higher goals.” That is exactly your problem: sentence/scene (tactics) must serve arc/world meaning (strategy). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 4) Tactics = Local Action, Real Consequences
MCDP 1-3 **Tactics** is about winning battles—local decisions with compounding consequences. That maps to scene-writing: a scene should create **irreversible pressure** that rolls forward. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### Practical Synthesis
- **Invariants** = intent / doctrine (what must remain true)
- **Scenes** = tactical actions (local decisions)
- **Arcs/Seasons** = campaigns (sequencing actions toward meaning)
- **Lore/World systems** = the operating environment (constraints + feedback)

## Quick Start Checklist
- [ ] Write **3–5 invariants** (single sentence each).
- [ ] For each invariant, write:
  - [ ] 1 line of dialogue that proves it
  - [ ] 1 character choice that pays its cost
  - [ ] 1 world-history event that demonstrates it at scale
  - [ ] 1 system rule (institution/economy/violence/tech) that makes it inevitable
- [ ] Create a “kill filter” rule: **if it violates an invariant, it dies.**
- [ ] Use the governance loop: **Diverge → Converge → Integrate → Commit**
