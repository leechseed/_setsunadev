It argues that learning is the mechanism by which the Marine Corps adapts faster than its enemies, translating experience into improved judgment, doctrine, and performance. The publication defines learning as more than training or education alone, explains how learning occurs across individuals, units, and the institution, and links learning directly to adaptation and innovation. It demands intellectual rigor, honest self-assessment, disciplined reflection, and a command climate that encourages critical thought and improvement.\\\n\\\n## TL;DR\\\n- Learning is essential to adaptation in war.\\\n- Learning occurs at individual, unit, and institutional levels.\\\n- Experience alone does not guarantee learning.\\\n- Learning requires reflection, analysis, and judgment.\\\n- Honest assessment is foundational to improvement.\\\n- Command climate strongly influences learning.\\\n- Training, education, and experience must be integrated.\\\n- Learning enables innovation and adaptation.\\\n- The Marine Corps must be a learning organization.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Table of Contents\\\n1.

**Therefore:** Military forces must learn continuously.\\\n- **Claim 2:** Experience does not automatically produce improvement.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Reflection and analysis are required.\\\n- **Claim 3:** Learning occurs at multiple levels.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Individuals, units, and institutions must all learn.\\\n- **Claim 4:** Leadership shapes learning behavior.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Command climate is decisive.\\\n- **Conclusion:** Effective learning enables adaptation and sustained combat effectiveness.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Key Concepts & Definitions\\\n- **Learning**: Creation of knowledge from experience.\\\n- **Adaptation**: Adjustment to changing conditions.\\\n- **Innovation**: Development of new methods or concepts.\\\n- **Judgment**: Ability to decide effectively based on understanding.\\\n- **Mental Models**: Internal representations shaping perception.\\\n- **Experience**: Exposure to events and action.\\\n- **Reflection**: Deliberate analysis of experience.\\\n- **After-Action Review**: Structured assessment for improvement.\\\n- **Learning Organization**: Entity that systematically improves through learning.\\\n- **Command Climate**: Environment shaped by leadership behavior.\\\n- **Doctrine**: Codified institutional knowledge.\\\n- **Education**: Development of understanding and judgment.\\\n- **Training**: Practice to build skill and proficiency.\\\n- **Lessons Learned**: Knowledge derived from experience.\\\n- **Institutional Learning**: Learning retained across the organization.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":7423}]"
