body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# The Leechseed Manifesto  \\\n## SECTION: Narrative Doctrine  \\\n## TITLE: The American Experience as Narrative Center\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Design Principle: America Is the Core Audience**\\\n\\\n**Statement of Intent**  \\\nStories built under the Leechseed Manifesto are **for Americans.**  \\\nThey are not manufactured for international neutrality, algorithmic global reach, or cultural dilution.  \\\nThey are **rooted**, **localized**, and **authentically shaped** by the emotional, historical, political, and psychological weight of the American experience.\\\n\\\nThis is not nationalism.  \\\nThis is **narrative orientation.**\\\n\\\n> You cannot make something universal by flattening it.  \\\n> You make it universal by going **so deep into something specific** that it pierces the human condition from within.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **The Mythic Terrain of the American Story**\\\n\\\nThe United States is not just a country.  \\\nIt is a **narrative superstructure** built on:\\\n\\\n- **Contradiction**: Freedom and control. Promise and betrayal.  \\\n- **Excess**: Scale, ambition, consumption, performance.  \\\n- **Violence**: Foundational, systemic, personal.  \\\n- **Spiritual Hunger**: A restless search for meaning in a commodified, secular empire.  \\\n- **Individualism**: The myth of the lone figure against the world.  \\\n- **Decay**: Infrastructure, dreams, morality—rotting in real time.\\\n\\\nThis is not background flavor. It is **story fuel.**  \\\nEvery narrative choice, every character arc, every thematic structure must **reckon with America’s textures**—directly or metaphorically.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Localization, Not Internationalization**\\\n\\\nThe Leechseed Doctrine rejects:\\\n\\\n- **Creative Globalism**: Writing for the approval of every market results in **soulless fiction**.  \\\n- **Moral Exporting**: Stories that lecture on behalf of institutions or NGOs are not stories. They’re pamphlets.  \\\n- **Cultural Neutrality**: Flattened stories built to avoid offending anyone say nothing worth hearing.\\\n\\\nInstead, it embraces:\\\n\\\n- **Accent, place, ritual, slang, contradiction, struggle**  \\\n- Stories soaked in American blood, land, media, and madness  \\\n- A commitment to **regional truth over global marketability**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Tropes and Themes That Belong**\\\n\\\n- **The American Dream / Nightmare Dichotomy**  \\\n- **The Frontier Myth**: Literal or psychological expansion into chaos  \\\n- **Violence as Inheritance**: Personal and historical  \\\n- **Christian Guilt and Secular Rebellion**  \\\n- **The Worker vs The Machine**  \\\n- **The Southern Gothic**, **Rust Belt Ruin**, **Suburban Rot**, **Urban Despair**, **Digital Isolation**  \\\n- **American Masculinity**, **Sexual Shame**, **Bootstraps Ideology**, **Freedom Fetishism**  \\\n- **Racial Tension**, **Class Conflict**, **Gun as Symbol**, **Country as Stage**  \\\n- **Pop Culture as Mythology**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Character Design Anchored in American DNA**\\\n\\\nCharacters are not generic. They are:\\\n\\\n- Veterans, waitresses, preachers, drifters, addicts, cops, teens raised by the internet, people who believe in things that are killing them  \\\n- People shaped by school shootings, evangelism, porn addiction, economic collapse, therapy culture, pharmaceutical dependence, road rage, or online radicalization  \\\n- Walking contradictions with American tattoos burned into their speech, goals, and fears\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Why This Matters**\\\n\\\n1. **Specificity Creates Power**  \\\n   Global stories often become **bland**, while localized stories become **profound**. (*The Sopranos* wasn’t for Italians—it was for *New Jersey*. And it became global because of it.)\\\n\\\n2. **Cultural Truth Has Weight**  \\\n   A story grounded in the real psychological and cultural contradictions of America *feels heavier*—because it is.\\\n\\\n3. **You Know Your Audience**  \\\n   When you stop trying to speak to everyone, you start saying something **real** to someone.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Final Dictum**\\\n\\\n> **Write for your own country.**  \\\n> **Bleed from your own soil.**  \\\n> If the story can’t speak to a gas station worker in Ohio, a bored teen in Tallahassee, or a burnout in Fresno—it’s not grounded enough.  \\\n> **The American Experience isn’t your backdrop. It’s your spine.**  \\\n> Write like you're testifying. Write like you're indicting. Write like you're free.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4185}]"
