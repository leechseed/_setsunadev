It integrates kink theory, visual trope modeling, and modular world logic to support seduction, reputation, social dynamics, and aesthetic-coding systems across narrative systems.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üß† OBJECTIVE  \\\nTo model characters not just by raw attractiveness, but by:\\\n- **Erotic power projection**\\\n- **Symbolic archetyping**\\\n- **Aesthetic presentation**\\\n- **Fetish and kink signaling**\\\n- **Interactional chemistry and social response**\\\n\\\nThis enables deeper compatibility for:\\\n- Procedural seduction events\\\n- Faction-based sexual norms and taboos\\\n- Narrative pacing around intimacy and taboo\\\n- Character arcs involving repression, exhibitionism, shame, or divine sexuality\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üóÉÔ∏è TABLE SCHEMA ‚Äì

**Narrative-Centric**: Enables symbolic, archetypal, or taboo-inflected storytelling.\\\n* **Modular**: Every field is string-tag and JSON-ready for fast integration.\\\n* **World-Linked**: Integrates into faction-based reputational logic for systemic simulation.\\\n* **Kink-Informed**: Leverages real fetish structures for emergent storytelling and consent modeling.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üõ†Ô∏è NEXT STEPS\\\n\\\n* [ ] Create `fetish_taxonomy` lookup table with canonical fetish tags and domains.\\\n* [ ] Define `aesthetic_coding` registry with linked visuals, tags, and cultural associations.\\\n* [ ] Integrate this schema with `scene_engine` to influence intimacy encounters and NPC behavior.\\\n* [ ] Link to `chemistry_matrix` for pairwise compatibility and attraction simulation.\\\n* [ ] Build automated `sexual_presence_template.md` frontmatter generator for YAML character notes.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üßæ SAMPLE YAML OUTPUT\\\n\\\n```yaml\\\nsexual_presence:\\\n
