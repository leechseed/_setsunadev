## Purpose

This document defines a **clear, staged roadmap** for moving from uncontrolled creative generation to deliberate, scalable creative production.

The goal is not to eliminate chaos, intuition, or manic creativity—but to **govern them**, so work can scale from sentences to worlds without collapsing.

---

## Phase 1 — Lock the Ground Rules

This phase establishes **non-negotiable constraints** before any serious creation begins.

### Step 1: Define Non-Negotiable Invariants

Write **exactly 3–5 invariant statements**.

These are not lore facts.  
They are **constraints on meaning**.

Each invariant must be:
- True in a single line of dialogue
- True across a character arc
- True in world history
- True even when plans fail

If an idea violates an invariant, it is removed immediately—regardless of quality or appeal.

**Deliverable:**  
`INVARIANTS.md` — a single markdown file listing only the invariants.

---

### Step 2: Declare Mode Authority

Acknowledge that you operate in multiple cognitive modes.  
The failure mode is not switching—it is **letting multiple modes hold authority at once**.

Define at minimum:
- **Muse Mode** — generates ideas
- **Architect Mode** — checks systems and scale
- **Editor Mode** — removes and refines
- **Operator Mode** — commits and ships

**Rule:**  
Only one mode has authority at any given time.

**Deliverable:**  
A short “Mode Governance Rules” section added to your knowledgebase.

---

## Phase 2 — Build the Minimum Control Surface

This phase creates just enough structure to prevent scale drift.

### Step 3: Create a Scale Spine

Do not build lore.  
Build **slots**.

Define your scale levels, for example:
- Sentence
- Scene
- Sequence
- Arc
- Season
- World

For each level, write **one governing question only**:

> How does this level enforce the invariants?

No content yet. Only structure.

**Deliverable:**  
`SCALE_SPINE.md`

---

### Step 4: Select a Test Artifact

Choose **one small artifact**, not the entire project:
- A single scene
- A short story
- A pilot episode
- A single character arc

Do not start with a universe.

**Rule:**  
If the system fails at small scale, it will collapse at large scale.

---

## Phase 3 — Run a Controlled Experiment

This phase validates the system under real conditions.

### Step 5: Execute the Governance Loop

For the test artifact, run this loop deliberately:

1. **Diverge** — Muse Mode, timed, no judgment
2. **Converge** — Editor Mode, invariants only
3. **Integrate** — Architect Mode, second-order effects
4. **Commit** — Operator Mode, lock and move on

Modes must not overlap.  
Skipping steps invalidates the test.

**Deliverable:**  
One finished artifact that survived governance.

---

### Step 6: Post-Mortem the Process

Do not critique the art.  
Critique the **process**.

Questions to answer:
- Where did chaos help?
- Where did chaos mislead?
- Which invariant did the most work?
- Which step was hardest to respect?

Adjust governance rules, not creative instincts.

---

## Phase 4 — Scale Decision Point

After one full cycle, make a single decision:

> Do I trust this system enough to scale it?

- If **yes**: apply it to the next larger unit (scene → arc, arc → season)
- If **no**: repair governance before expanding scope

Scaling without trust guarantees collapse.

---

## Hard Truths

Your primary risk is not lack of skill, intelligence, or taste.

It is **over-identification with the generative state**.

Systems thinking is not here to cage creativity.  
It exists to decide **when creativity is allowed to run wild**.

---

## Immediate Next Action

Do this today:

1. Open a blank file
2. Name it `INVARIANTS.md`
3. Write blunt, unpoetic invariant statements
4. Stop at five
5. Do not revise for beauty—only for truth

This is the first irreversible step.
