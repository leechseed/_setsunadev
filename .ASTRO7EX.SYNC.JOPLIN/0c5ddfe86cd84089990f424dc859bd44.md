# Basic Plot Summary | ASTRO7EX

Vivian, a former child supersoldier turned mythic lunar fixer, lives in detached luxury after pulling off the heist of the century—recovering a lost Bitcoin wallet from beneath the Moon’s surface. Unknown to her, the job also unearthed fragments of AN7L, a buried supersoldier program privatized by the ultra-Mormon megacorp MORN. When a hyperhuman assassin lobotomizes her memory of the job and leaves her for dead, she is saved by a strange girl named Myrtle—who may be a ghost of guilt or corrupted memory. As her former crewmates are hunted and wiped, Vivian uncovers that MORN is attempting to awaken the Godking: a mythic AI originally programmed to guide the Church back to Earth, now misfiring in self-justified genocide. In the final confrontation, Vivian faces John Smith the Eternal—the Godking itself—who believes the seven resurrected him. But Vivian knows the truth: they only opened a grave. As her ability to see cyber-ghost traces in lobotomy needles deepens, she must choose whether to fade into oblivion or destroy the myth she accidentally reawakened.
