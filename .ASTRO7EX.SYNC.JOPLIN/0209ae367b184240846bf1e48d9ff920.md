## 1. **John Smith and Fiona**

**📝 Summary**: John and Fiona are rival architects of Vivian’s delay. While John offers grim certainty through a prophetic worldview, Fiona invites seduction through pleasurable suspension.

Their battle is waged not through direct confrontation but through their influence on Vivian’s soul.

* **Narrative Function**: Antagonist vs. Contagonist
* **Core Conflict**: Prophetic determinism vs. Hedonistic delay
* **Tone**: Strategic mistrust

## 2. **John Smith and MODS**

**📝 Summary**: John Smith and the MODS form a closed system—he proclaims meaning, they negate it. Their alignment is absolute in impact but discordant in nature.
