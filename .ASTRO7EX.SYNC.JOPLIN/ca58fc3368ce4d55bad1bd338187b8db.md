## 🧬 Overview

The relationship between **Myrtle** and **Nacho** in ASTRO7EX is the closest the story offers to a functional bond. Unlike every other character who tries to control or categorize Myrtle, Nacho extends to her something rare: *respect without certainty*. He does not understand her, and he doesn’t need to. But he knows she matters.

Their dynamic is built around **guardianship without possession**. Myrtle becomes, for Nacho, an echo of a world that logic forgot—a living sign that not all lost things should be found with certainty.

If Vivian is Nacho’s client and the MODS are his nemesis, Myrtle is his *exception clause*. She changes nothing in his mission—but shifts everything in his manner.

## 🪞 Establishing the Relationship

**Point of Origin**
Nacho first becomes aware of Myrtle while auditing ghost-access logs left behind in the vaults under the lava tubes. Myrtle appears not as a person—but as a trace signature in *Vivian's analog ledger system*—a set of phantom entries no one remembers writing.

**First Contact**
Myrtle enters Nacho’s secure listening chamber and offers him a mechanical bird. The bird is silent. It does nothing. Nacho accepts it anyway.

**Core Exchange**

> *Myrtle*: “Do you guard treasure because it's precious?”
> *Nacho*: “No. Because it is unfinished.”

**Craft Techniques Referenced**

* **The First Five Pages** (Lukeman): Their relationship is introduced with no exposition—just a single, unexplainable gesture that refuses easy meaning.
* **Hooked** (Edgerton): Nacho's interest is not reactive; it is *respectful stillness*—a rare hook rooted in restraint.
* **McKee – Story**: Conflict is not the only spark. *Recognition without comprehension* is more powerful.

## 🔧 Developing the Relationship

**Growth through Parallel Service**

* Myrtle never formally asks for Nacho’s help.
* Nacho never formally offers it.
* And yet, over time, their interactions become coded rituals:

  * Myrtle appears during Nacho's analog calibration phases.
  * Nacho always leaves one chair unplugged—*just in case*.

**Spiritual Function**
Myrtle becomes Nacho’s test of **faith in irrational continuity**. For a guardian built on logic, Myrtle is a paradox: a creature outside reason whom he chooses to guard anyway.

**Material Collaboration**
At one point, Myrtle reroutes a catastrophic backup loop through an obsolete music box hidden in Nacho’s vault. Nacho doesn’t ask how she did it. He simply says:

> “Next time, ask before hacking Mozart.”

**Craft Techniques Referenced**

* **Writing Deep Scenes**: Their quiet co-presence builds layered subtext. Dialogue is minimal, but context grows rich.
* **Emotional Craft (Maass)**: Their tension is not emotional trauma—it is *emotional possibility withheld*.
* **2000s Sci-Fi Archetypes**: Think Kino from *Kino's Journey* meeting Jet from *Cowboy Bebop*—a stoic protector watching a transient spirit pass through.

## 🕯️ Resolving the Relationship

**Turning Point**
As the system collapse nears and the final countdown is triggered (DHR Protocol), Myrtle visits Nacho's secure bunker. The bird she gave him begins to chirp—a simple song it had never sung before.

> *Myrtle*: “Now it’s finished.”
> *Nacho*: “Then I must begin guarding it for real.”

**Final Act**
Myrtle hands Nacho a set of coordinates—physical, analog, carved into wax. It's the only key to a fail-safe Vivian will never find.

> She trusts him more than anyone else, and says nothing.

Nacho doesn’t stop her from leaving. He doesn’t follow. He just **watches the silence**, then seals the door behind her.

**Narrative Effect**
Myrtle leaves Nacho with the most valuable thing he’s ever been asked to protect—**a secret that can’t be explained**, only preserved.

**Craft Techniques Referenced**

* **Iglesias – Writing for Emotional Impact**: Their goodbye is not dialogue. It is trust without closure.
* **Bloom**: Myrtle is the embodiment of Emersonian transcendence—never fully knowable, but always felt.
* **Campbell**: She gives Nacho the *boon*, and then vanishes—like a child-god handing off fate to the guardian.

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Harold Bloom**        | Nacho is a Falstaff-turned-Borges librarian. He recognizes in Myrtle the child of memory and chaos.                                                     |
| **Joseph Campbell**     | Their bond reflects the unspoken promise of myth: not all magic is heroic. Some is *custodial*.                                                         |
| **Late 2000s Sci-Fi**   | Myrtle is the “anomaly girl” who survives the script. Nacho is the *last man to believe in her without trying to own her.*                              |
| **Narrative Astrology** | Their synastry: Myrtle’s Neptune conjunct Nacho’s Saturn. She dissolves the rigidity of his control; he structures her ghost logic into protected form. |
| **Progressions**        | Their relationship matures from Mutable (flexible) to Fixed (resolute). Neither abandons their function, but both evolve their context.                 |

## 🎯 Summary

Myrtle and Nacho share the **most uncorrupted connection** in ASTRO7EX. It is not one of ideology, fate, or even story—it is built on **witnessing without need**. He never tries to understand her. She never tries to fix him. And in doing so, they protect something the others lose: **a space beyond logic, untouched by control.**

> *She leaves him a song.*
> *He guards it with his life.*
