It argues that war is a fundamentally human contest of opposing wills—violent, uncertain, and complex—where friction, chance, and disorder are normal. From that reality, it derives a maneuver warfare approach: win by creating and exploiting advantage faster than the enemy can adapt, shattering the enemy’s cohesion rather than grinding down every piece. The publication then translates that theory into how Marines should organize, train, educate, lead, decide, and command—emphasizing initiative, commander’s intent, mission tactics, main effort, and combined arms.\\\n\\\n## TL;DR\\\n- War is not controllable engineering; it is a human struggle under friction, uncertainty, and disorder.\\\n- Since certainty is impossible, we must build forces and leaders who can act effectively anyway.\\\n- Maneuver warfare aims to shatter enemy cohesion with rapid, focused, unexpected actions—not just “attrit” units.\\\n- We seek advantage in all dimensions (time, psychology, position), with tempo and focus as recurring sources of combat power.\\\n- Command exists to create unity of effort while preserving subordinate initiative (mission tactics + commander’s intent).\\\n- Preparation for war is about building a professional, adaptable institution, not memorizing checklists.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Table of Contents\\\n1.

It must evolve with experience and the changing face of war.\\\n- The revision clarifies and sharpens key maneuver warfare concepts (intent, main effort, critical vulnerability).\\\n\\\n### Preface\\\n- The original *Warfighting* sparked wide debate and influenced how Marines approach tasks.\\\n- War is timeless in nature and changing in method. Therefore, our doctrine must refine continuously.\\\n- The text is intended to be read cover-to-cover as a coherent argument.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Chapter 1 — The Nature of War\\\n\\\n### War Defined\\\n- War is organized violence used to impose a will. It is political in consequence even when not “declared.”\\\n- War is interactive. The enemy is not a target; it is a thinking force with its own plans.\\\n- The object is to impose our will. Violence is the means, but the will is the center.\\\n\\\n### Friction\\\n- War looks simple in concept and becomes difficult in execution.\\\n- Friction is the accumulation of countless impediments that resist action and drain energy.\\\n- We minimize self-induced friction. We also learn to fight effectively despite friction and to increase the enemy’s friction.\\\n\\\n### Uncertainty\\\n- War takes place in a fog of incomplete, inaccurate, contradictory information.\\\n- Since certainty is impossible, judgment is required: possibility vs. probability.\\\n- We reduce uncertainty where we can, but we fight through it with simple plans, initiative, and flexibility.\\\n\\\n### Fluidity\\\n- War is a continuous flow of shifting situations, not isolated “turns.”\\\n- Opportunities are fleeting; conditions change faster than perfect plans can keep up.\\\n- Tempo fluctuates. We learn to exploit rhythm—when to push and when to reset.\\\n\\\n### Disorder\\\n- In war, plans break, communications fail, and misunderstanding is routine.\\\n- We cannot impose precise control. We impose a framework and influence flow.\\\n- Disorder is not merely endured; it can be generated and exploited against the enemy.\\\n\\\n### Complexity\\\n- War is a system of many interacting parts on both sides, not a single brain directing a machine.\\\n- Outcomes emerge from distributed decisions and local interactions under imperfect information.\\\n- Over-centralization collides with the nature of war. We need decentralized competence.\\\n\\\n### The Human Dimension\\\n- War is ultimately a test of human will, perception, fear, courage, endurance, and cohesion.\\\n- Morale, leadership, and discipline are not accessories. They are decisive factors.\\\n- Human behavior makes war unpredictable and resistant to tidy models.\\\n\\\n### Violence and Danger\\\n- War is not a metaphor. It is violent, lethal, and hazardous.\\\n- Fear, fatigue, and stress are constant pressures shaping performance.\\\n- We prepare forces to function amid danger rather than being surprised by it.\\\n\\\n### Physical, Moral, and Mental Forces\\\n- Combat effectiveness is not only physical. Moral and mental factors can dominate outcomes.\\\n- What matters is the combined product of these forces in a specific situation.\\\n- We develop Marines who can impose will under strain, not just execute tasks.\\\n\\\n### The Evolution of War\\\n- The character of war changes with technology, culture, and organization.\\\n- The nature of war remains. Human contest, uncertainty, friction, violence persist.\\\n- We adapt methods without forgetting what does not change.\\\n\\\n### The Science, Art, and Dynamic of War\\\n- War contains aspects that can be studied, but it is not reducible to formula.\\\n- It is both science and art, requiring judgment under pressure.\\\n- War is dynamic interaction. The enemy adapts. We adapt faster.\\\n\\\n### Conclusion (Ch. 1)\\\n- War’s normal condition is friction, uncertainty, fluidity, disorder, and complexity.\\\n- Any doctrine that assumes clarity and control will fail in practice.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Chapter 2 — The Theory of War\\\n\\\n### War as an Act of Policy\\\n- War serves policy. It does not replace it.\\\n- Military action must be understood as a means to political ends.\\\n- The policy context shapes acceptable risk, objectives, and termination.\\\n\\\n### Means in War\\\n- Means include more than weapons. They include time, information, will, alliances, and legitimacy.\\\n- The enemy is attacked as a system, not only as a collection of targets.\\\n- We seek effects that change enemy behavior, not merely physical destruction.\\\n\\\n### The Spectrum of Conflict\\\n- Conflict ranges from limited operations to major war.\\\n- Forms of conflict evolve. War can be unconventional and politically ambiguous.\\\n- We prepare for variation without losing doctrinal coherence.\\\n\\\n### Levels of War\\\n- Strategic, operational, and tactical levels connect but are not interchangeable.\\\n- Tactical success must serve operational purpose, which serves strategic ends.\\\n- Misalignment wastes effort and can win battles while losing wars.\\\n\\\n### Initiative and Response\\\n- Initiative is not a slogan. It is an operational advantage.\\\n- Acting first forces the enemy into reaction, reducing their freedom of action.\\\n- We cultivate forces that can seize, exploit, and regain initiative.\\\n\\\n### Styles of Warfare\\\n- Styles sit on a spectrum rather than in neat boxes.\\\n- The central contrast: attrition logic vs. maneuver logic.\\\n- Maneuver emphasizes disruption and systemic collapse, not just depletion.\\\n\\\n### Combat Power\\\n- Combat power is situational. It is produced from physical, moral, and mental factors.\\\n- It is not simply “numbers.” It is the effective ability to impose will at the decisive point.\\\n\\\n### Speed and Focus\\\n- Speed is a weapon. Tempo forces the enemy into late decisions.\\\n- Focus concentrates effects at the decisive place and moment.\\\n- Speed + focus create shock and disorientation that outperforms brute accumulation.\\\n\\\n### Surprise and Boldness\\\n- Surprise causes disorientation that reduces enemy capacity to resist.\\\n- Boldness exploits uncertainty and creates dilemmas for the enemy.\\\n- Boldness must be disciplined by purpose, not reckless gambling.\\\n\\\n### Centers of Gravity and Critical Vulnerabilities\\\n- We identify what gives the enemy freedom of action and will to fight.\\\n- We attack weaknesses that produce disproportionate systemic effects.\\\n- We avoid wasting effort on hardened surfaces when decisive vulnerabilities exist elsewhere.\\\n\\\n### Creating and Exploiting Opportunity\\\n- War creates openings. We generate them and seize them.\\\n- Opportunism is not improvisation without discipline; it is disciplined exploitation.\\\n- We accept risk to gain advantage, and we do it faster than the enemy.\\\n\\\n### Conclusion (Ch. 2)\\\n- Theory must match reality: war is dynamic interaction under friction and uncertainty.\\\n- Maneuver warfare is the doctrinal answer to that reality.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Chapter 3 — Preparing for War\\\n\\\n### Force Planning\\\n- Build forces for uncertainty, not for a single predicted scenario.\\\n- Readiness is more than equipment status. It is institutional adaptability.\\\n\\\n### Organization\\\n- Organization must support tempo, initiative, and combined arms.\\\n- Structures that require constant top-down direction will slow down in combat.\\\n\\\n### Doctrine\\\n- Doctrine guides action but requires judgment in application.\\\n- Doctrine’s purpose is unity of thought and action under uncertainty.\\\n\\\n### Professionalism\\\n- Warfighting is a profession requiring study, reflection, and discipline.\\\n- We cultivate leaders who can decide and act under pressure.\\\n\\\n### Training\\\n- Training must be realistic and free-play enough to expose friction and uncertainty.\\\n- We train judgment and initiative, not only task completion.\\\n\\\n### Professional Military Education\\\n- PME builds the conceptual tools required for war’s complexity.\\\n- Education supports adaptation and the ability to learn faster than the enemy.\\\n\\\n### Personnel Management\\\n- We select, develop, and assign Marines to sustain competence and initiative.\\\n- Leadership development is not optional; it is combat power.\\\n\\\n### Equipping\\\n- Equipment must support doctrine, not substitute for it.\\\n- Technology can create advantage, but it can also add friction if it complicates action.\\\n\\\n### Conclusion (Ch. 3)\\\n- Preparation is the long-term creation of a force that can fight and win in uncertainty.\\\n- The objective is readiness of mind and institution, not merely inventory.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Chapter 4 — The Conduct of War\\\n\\\n### The Challenge\\\n- War is fought against an adaptive enemy under chaotic conditions.\\\n- The central problem: create advantage and decision faster than the enemy.\\\n\\\n### Maneuver Warfare\\\n- Maneuver is not only movement. It is action that generates advantage in any dimension.\\\n- Maneuver warfare seeks to shatter cohesion through rapid, focused, unexpected actions.\\\n- The goal is to render the enemy unable to function as a coordinated whole.\\\n\\\n### Orienting on the Enemy\\\n- We fight the enemy system, not the map.\\\n- Our decisions are shaped by enemy capability, intent, cohesion, and vulnerability.\\\n- We focus on what breaks the enemy’s ability to respond effectively.\\\n\\\n### Philosophy of Command\\\n- Command must balance control with initiative.\\\n- We cannot centrally manage every action in war. We establish intent and focus.\\\n- Unity is achieved through shared understanding, not micromanagement.\\\n\\\n### Shaping the Action\\\n- We shape conditions to create favorable decisions before decisive engagements.\\\n- We generate dilemmas: multiple threats, rapid tempo, uncertainty, dislocation.\\\n- Shaping reduces enemy options and increases our freedom of action.\\\n\\\n### Decisionmaking\\\n- Decision is the decisive act. Information supports decision; it does not replace it.\\\n- We cannot wait for perfect clarity. We act on acceptable risk.\\\n- We seek to decide and act faster than the enemy’s cycle.\\\n\\\n### Mission Tactics\\\n- Seniors assign missions without prescribing the method.\\\n- Subordinates have both freedom and duty to act based on the situation.\\\n- Mission tactics enables tempo and adaptation without waiting for permission.\\\n\\\n### Commander’s Intent\\\n- Every mission has task and purpose. Intent states the purpose.\\\n- Intent endures when the plan breaks. It guides initiative when circumstances change.\\\n- Good intent is brief, compelling, and understood at least two levels down.\\\n\\\n### Main Effort\\\n- One effort is designated as the focal point at a given moment.\\\n- The main effort receives priority of support. Others align to it.\\\n- It harmonizes initiative: actions are judged by how they support the main effort.\\\n\\\n### Surfaces and Gaps\\\n- Enemy strength and weakness are uneven.\\\n- We avoid smashing into strength when we can penetrate weakness.\\\n- We seek gaps, create gaps, and exploit them to collapse coherence.\\\n\\\n### Combined Arms\\\n- We integrate different arms to produce complementary effects.\\\n- Combined arms creates dilemmas the enemy cannot solve with a single response.\\\n- Integration increases shock, tempo, and systemic disruption.\\\n\\\n### Conclusion (Ch. 4)\\\n- Winning demands tempo, focus, initiative, and disciplined opportunism.\\\n- Command and control exists to enable decision and exploitation under chaos.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Notes\\\n- The notes provide sourcing, definitions, and doctrinal cross-references.\\\n- They reinforce that many key terms have joint definitions but require judgment in use.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Mental Models\\\n\\\n### 1) “War as a Contest of Wills”\\\n- **Model:** Two adaptive opponents locked in continuous action and counteraction.\\\n- **Use:** Stop treating the enemy like terrain. Expect them to learn and react.\\\n\\\n### 2) “Friction Budget”\\\n- **Model:** Every plan spends friction. Complexity spends more.\\\n- **Use:** Reduce self-induced friction. Preserve will, tempo, and simplicity.\\\n\\\n### 3) “Tempo as a Weapon”\\\n- **Model:** Faster cycles create compounding advantage.\\\n- **Use:** Aim to act, learn, and adapt faster than the enemy can respond.\\\n\\\n### 4) “Cohesion Kill”\\\n- **Model:** The enemy can be neutralized by breaking coordination, not only by killing parts.\\\n- **Use:** Seek systemic disruption: morale, communications, command, trust, timing.\\\n\\\n### 5) “Intent-Led Decentralization”\\\n- **Model:** Intent provides unity; mission tactics provides initiative.\\\n- **Use:** Seniors focus on purpose and priorities; subordinates solve the local problem.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Argument Map\\\n- **Claim 1:** War is inherently uncertain, friction-filled, and disorderly.\\\n  - Therefore, doctrine must assume chaos, not clarity.\\\n- **Claim 2:** Because war is a contest of wills, the decisive effects are often moral and mental as much as physical.\\\n  - Therefore, cohesion, leadership, and initiative are combat power.\\\n- **Claim 3:** Maneuver warfare is best suited to win under these conditions.\\\n  - Because it attacks the enemy system and decision cycle.\\\n- **Claim 4:** To execute maneuver warfare, command must enable initiative.\\\n  - Therefore: mission tactics, commander’s intent, and main effort are central.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Key Concepts & Definitions\\\n- **War**: Organized violence used to impose one will on another for political ends.\\\n- **Friction**: The accumulation of impediments that makes the apparently easy difficult.\\\n- **Uncertainty (Fog of War)**: The permanent condition of incomplete and unreliable information.\\\n- **Disorder**: The natural breakdown of plans, control, and communications under combat conditions.\\\n- **Combat Power**: The situational product of physical, moral, and mental factors.\\\n- **Maneuver Warfare**: A philosophy that seeks to shatter enemy cohesion with rapid, focused, unexpected actions.\\\n- **Mission Tactics**: Assign the mission; do not prescribe the method.\\\n- **Commander’s Intent**: The purpose behind the task; the durable guide when plans change.\\\n- **Main Effort**: The prioritized action/unit that receives support and aligns the force.\\\n- **Surfaces and Gaps**: Enemy strengths to avoid/bypass and weaknesses/openings to penetrate and exploit.\\\n- **Combined Arms**: The integrated use of different capabilities to create dilemmas and amplify effects.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":18301}]"
