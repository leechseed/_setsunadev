Rest 90–150 sec.\\\n\\\n### 2) Bulgarian Split Squat (rear foot on bench)\\\n- 3 x 8–12 / leg  \\\n**Glute bias:** slight forward torso, drive through midfoot/heel. Rest 90–120 sec.\\\n\\\n### 3) Step-Ups (high step if safe)\\\n- 3 x 8–12 / leg  \\\nHold DBs or wear loaded backpack.\\\n\\\n### 4) Band Abductions (mini band above knees)\\\nPick one:\\\n- **Standing abduction**: 2–3 x 20–30 / side\\\n- **Lateral walk burnout**: 2 rounds of 15–20 steps each way\\\n\\\n### 5) Finisher (optional)\\\n- **Frog pumps**: 2 x 25–40\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Day B — Hinge + Unilateral (glute stretch day)\\\n### 1) Romanian Deadlift (DB/KB/backpack)\\\n- 4 x 6–12  \\\n**Rules:** hips back, soft knees, keep the weight close, stretch in glutes/hamstrings. Rest 2 min.\\\n\\\n### 2) Single-Leg RDL (DB/KB)\\\n- 3 x 8–12 / leg  \\\nGo slow. Balance matters more than weight.\\\n\\\n### 3) Reverse Lunge (glute friendly)\\\n- 3 x 10–15 / leg  \\\nDBs or backpack. Rest 90 sec.\\\n\\\n### 4) B-stance Hip Thrust (one foot slightly forward)\\\n- 3 x 10–15 / side  \\\n2-sec squeeze at top.\\\n\\\n### 5) Band Kickbacks (anchor band around bench leg if possible)\\\n- 2–3 x 15–25 / side  \\\nIf you can’t anchor: do **quadruped kickbacks** with a mini band.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Day C — Pump + Upper-Glute + “work capacity”\\\n### 1) Hip Thrust (lighter, high reps)\\\n- 3 x 12–25  \\\nShorter rest: 60–90 sec.\\\n\\\n### 2) Walking Lunges (or stationary if space sucks)\\\n- 3 x 20–40 total steps  \\\nAdd DBs/backpack if you can keep form.\\\n\\\n### 3) 45° “Park Hamstring/Glute” Substitute\\\nPick one:\\\n- **Single-leg hip hinge good-morning** (bodyweight or backpack): 3 x 12–20\\\n- **Bench-supported back extension substitute** (hands on bench, hinge pattern): 3 x 15–25\\\n(If this feels sketchy, skip it—don’t be a hero.)\\\n\\\n### 4) Abduction Giant Set (no rest)\\\n- **Lateral walks**: 15–20 steps each way\\\n- **Side-lying abduction**: 15–25 / side\\\n- **Frog pumps**: 20–40  \\\nDo 2–3 rounds.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Progression (how you get bigger glutes without machines)\\\nUse this rule for each main move (thrust, split squat, RDL):\\\n- Stay in the rep range.\\\n- When you hit the **top reps on all sets**, make it harder next time by ONE of:\\\n  - Add weight (DBs/backpack)\\\n  - Add reps\\\n  - Add a set (max +1 set per exercise)\\\n  - Add tempo: **3 sec down**\\\n  - Add a pause: **2 sec at stretch** (bottom of split squat/RDL) or **2 sec at lockout** (thrust)\\\n\\\n**If you’re stuck with light weights:** use unilateral + tempo + pauses + high reps. That works.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## “Tell it like it is” form priorities\\\n- **Hip thrusts:** if you’re not fully locking out and squeezing, you’re wasting sets.\\\n- **Split squats/lunges:** control the bottom. If knees hate it, shorten range and do reverse lunges/step-ups.\\\n- **RDLs:** if you feel it in low back more than glutes/hamstrings, lighten the load and hinge correctly.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Packing list (so you actually do it)\\\n- DBs/KB or backpack + load\\\n- 2 bands (mini + long)\\\n- mat + towel (thrust pad)\\\n- water + timer (phone)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Optional: 2-day version (if you want it simpler)\\\n**Day 1:** Day A  \\\n**Day 2:** Day B  \\\nAdd Day C stuff as a 10-min finisher twice/week (abduction giant set).\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4142}]"
