## 🧭 PURPOSE OF STEP 1

Step 1 of the Dramatica process—**Setting the Stage**—lays the narrative and thematic groundwork. This includes defining archetypes, establishing the central character web, clarifying major relationships, and aligning world logic with emotional stakes. These foundational choices shape the *Story Mind*, ensuring consistency in tone, theme, and motivation before structural commitments are made in Storyforming.

## 🧱 CORE STRUCTURAL ROLES (ARCHETYPES)

### ✅ **Main Character: Vivian**
- **Role**: Protagonist / Main Character  
- **Function**: Seeks the Story Goal; the emotional POV lens through which the audience engages the narrative  
- **Dramatica Archetype**: Protagonist / Driver  
- **Narrative Summary**: Former child supersoldier, now a jaded lunar fixer drifting in the wake of a failed revolution and lost identity. Haunted by lobotomized memories and unresolved guilt, Vivian's arc traces her move from numbness to chosen meaning.
- **Personality**: A calculated mix of *Akali* and *Asuka*—emotionally volatile, sharp, guarded, and cynical but still craving connection.
- **Story Duties**: Considers the story goal, influences others to do the same; leads the physical pursuit of the goal.

---

### ✅ **Impact Character: MODS**
- **Role**: Impact Character  
- **Function**: Challenges Vivian’s path by representing the seductive pull of disbelief, delay, and bureaucratic entropy.  
- **Dramatica Archetype**: Skeptic / Impact  
- **Narrative Summary**: Faceless moderators and procedural skeptics who resist progress through logic and obstruction. When seen, they resemble disheveled, deadpan bureaucrats (like Asmongold fused with Mr. Smith from *The Matrix*).
- **Personality**: Cynical, dismissive, and addicted to being correct.
- **Story Duties**: Force Vivian to reconsider belief in meaning by embodying the systemic pressure to disengage.

---

### ✅ **Contagonist: Fiona**
- **Role**: Contagonist  
- **Function**: Distracts the Protagonist from the goal through seduction, luxury, and emotional sedation.  
- **Dramatica Archetype**: Contagonist  
- **Narrative Summary**: Corporate courtesan and emotional manipulator. Provides Vivian with predictable comfort, affection, and a place to disappear in exchange for staying numb. The velvet-wrapped off-ramp from story progression.
- **Personality**: Sensual, composed, calculating; indulgent and emotionally inaccessible.
- **Story Duties**: Tempts the Protagonist toward stasis through mental efforts (emotional seduction) and hinders progress physically (entanglements, obligations, distraction).

---

### ✅ **Guardian: Nacho**
- **Role**: Guardian  
- **Function**: Provides wisdom, conscience, and logistical support to help the Protagonist pursue the goal.  
- **Dramatica Archetype**: Guardian / Voice of Conscience  
- **Narrative Summary**: A one-of-a-kind analog AI advisor who guards Vivian’s secret wealth estate. Speaks with seductive charm but operates with strategic loyalty. He is the one tether that still believes in her.
- **Personality**: A dignified Mexican gentleman with strategic cunning and unwavering devotion.
- **Story Duties**: Offers logical support and material assistance toward achieving the goal. Influences Vivian’s conscience without coercion.

---

### ✅ **Sidekick: Myrtle**
- **Role**: Sidekick  
- **Function**: Faithful supporter who reinforces belief in the Story Goal and Protagonist.  
- **Dramatica Archetype**: Sidekick / Emotional Anchor  
- **Narrative Summary**: A mysterious girl who “rescued” Vivian post-lobotomy, later revealed to be a corrupted neural echo or personification of guilt. Never the same, always there.  
- **Personality**: A blend of *Rei Ayanami*, *Gawr Gura*, and *Yuki Nagato*—emotionally flat but fiercely devoted.
- **Story Duties**: Mentally reinforces faith in the goal; physically supports Vivian with quiet presence and emotional persistence.

---

### ✅ **Antagonist: John Smith the Eternal**
- **Role**: Antagonist  
- **Function**: Opposes the Story Goal through calculated resistance, narrative reframing, and systematic obstruction.  
- **Dramatica Archetype**: Antagonist / System Incarnate  
- **Narrative Summary**: Calm, prophetic, and terrifyingly gentle. A divine bureaucrat who seeks to reclaim the Godking AI and reinstate theological order through Vivian’s submission. Part Mr. Rogers, part Bob Ross—if either believed in techno-theocratic obedience.
- **Personality**: Soft-spoken prophet with absolute certainty. Every smile is a sentence.  
- **Story Duties**: Mentally reframes Vivian’s choices as prophecy; physically opposes her efforts by reactivating the system that erased her.

---

### ✅ **Reason: The Committee**
- **Role**: Voice of Logic  
- **Function**: Represents the cold, procedural intellect of the story.  
- **Dramatica Archetype**: Reason  
- **Narrative Summary**: A collective of rational adjudicators visualized as the House of Commons—distant, deliberative, and politically correct to the point of absurdity.  
- **Personality**: Dry, clinical, process-obsessed. Values structure over emotional truth.
- **Story Duties**: Provides logical counterbalance and control, even when inconvenient to the human story unfolding.
