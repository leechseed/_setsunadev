The reverse is also true: **no setup should exist without a corresponding payoff**. This principle enforces structural integrity, reader satisfaction, and thematic weight.\\\n\\\n> “Foreshadowing without fulfillment is a lie. Fulfillment without foreshadowing is theft.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Table of Contents**\\\n\\\n1. [Core Purpose](#core-purpose)\\\n2.
