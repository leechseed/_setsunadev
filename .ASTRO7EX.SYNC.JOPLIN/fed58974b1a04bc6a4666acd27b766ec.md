body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"---\\\n\\\n### **Narrative Dilemma**\\\n\\\n* **Definition**:\\\n  A narrative dilemma is a storytelling device in which a character must choose between two or more conflicting options, each with meaningful and irreversible consequences. There is no easy or painless outcome—every path entails loss, risk, or compromise. Indecision is not neutral; it typically results in the worst possible fallout, forcing the character to act.\\\n\\\n* **Function**:\\\n  Dilemmas serve a dual purpose:\\\n\\\n  1. **Drive the plot forward** through consequential decision-making.\\\n  2. **Reveal and develop character** by exposing their values, priorities, and limitations under pressure.\\\n\\\n* **Core Characteristics**:\\\n\\\n  * **Mutual Exclusivity**: Only one option can be taken; choosing one inherently sacrifices another.\\\n  * **High Stakes**: Each choice affects critical elements—survival, relationships, ethics, or goals.\\\n  * **Double Fallout for Inaction**: Avoiding the decision results in both negative outcomes or an escalation of conflict.\\\n  * **Character Consequence**: The choice reflects internal values and shapes the arc—growth, corruption, or revelation.\\\n\\\n* **Creative Imperative**:\\\n  The narrative dilemma is *the* gold standard of story problems. When constructing a plot, strive to build conflicts that **simultaneously escalate external stakes and demand internal decisions**. This is the most efficient and rewarding use of narrative resources.\\\n\\\n  Much like designing a restaurant menu where dishes share ingredients to maximize efficiency, **a good dilemma integrates plot propulsion and character development into a single, potent event**. It ensures every scene pays off in more than one way—forward movement and deeper understanding.\\\n\\\n* **Narrative Payoff**:\\\n  A dilemma, properly crafted, doesn’t just make the audience wonder *what will happen next*, it makes them ask *what kind of person is this becoming*—and that’s where story becomes unforgettable.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1938}]"
