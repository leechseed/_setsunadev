# 📘 Layer 3 — Human Interface
---


## 1. Compression — *How the self survives pressure*
**Identity narrows to remain legible.**

> Under constraint, complexity is shed. The self contracts toward what can be tolerated, categorized, or passed through the system.

---

## 2. Ritualization — *How meaning persists without outcome*
**Repetition replaces causality.**

> When action no longer changes results, sequence preserves coherence and prevents collapse.

---

## 3. Defiance Without Expectation — *How dignity is asserted*
**Action continues without belief in success.**

> Choices are made despite certainty of loss; refusal is expressed through motion, not strategy.

---

## 4. Transactional Intimacy — *How connection survives scarcity*
**Closeness is routed through cost.**

> Relationships form under leverage, risk, or exchange; affection persists, but with terms.

---

## 5. Dissociation — *How function is preserved under threat*
**Feeling is reduced to maintain operation.**

> Emotional distance enables endurance when proximity would overwhelm capacity.

---

## 6. Stubborn Continuity — *How existence resists erasure*
**Presence is maintained without recognition.**

> The self remains despite exclusion, invisibility, or irrelevance.

---

## 7. Quiet Delusion — *How interior meaning survives hostility*
**Private meaning is maintained without standing.**

> Significance is held internally without expectation of validation, confirmation, or effect.
