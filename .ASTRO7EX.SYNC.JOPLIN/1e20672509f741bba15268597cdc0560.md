### **Teaser Options**

1. **Dramatic Physical Event**  
   Focus on a dramatic physical event that takes place deeper into the story. *Hint: Show only one part of this scene. Save the full scene for later!*  

2. **Dreamlike Event**  
   Show a dreamlike event that turns out to be reality later on.  

3. **Antagonist at Work**  
   Come up on an antagonist involved in their evil work.  

4. **Intense Private Moment**  
   Focus on an intense, private moment filled with emotion — something that will be explained later.  

5. **Genre-Specific Opening**  
   - A scare if it’s a horror story.  
   - A silly moment if it’s a comedy.  
   - A battle if it’s a war story.
