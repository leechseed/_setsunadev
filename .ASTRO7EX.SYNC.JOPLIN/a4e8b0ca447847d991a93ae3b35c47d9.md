body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"Excellent—this is the **MC Approach** question in Dramatica Storyforming:\\\n\\\n> Does your Main Character prefer to resolve personal problems **externally** (*Do-er*) or **internally** (*Be-er*)?\\\n\\\nThis decision defines **how Vivian tackles her personal struggles**, not just what she’s capable of. It answers:\\\n\\\n> *“When confronted with a problem, does she change the world, or try to change herself?”*\\\n\\\nWe’ll explore both options in detail using Dramatica theory, her **narratological birth chart**, and **symbolic narrative astrology**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🔨 OPTION 1: **Do-er**\\\n\\\n> “If something’s wrong, I’ll take action. I’ll make it move. I’ll break it open.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🧠 Dramatica Theory\\\n\\\n* A **Do-er** sees **external change** as the solution to internal conflict.\\\n* Even when the pain is personal, the response is outward: move, fight, hack, flee, kill, steal, sabotage.\\\n* This character tends to act first and reflect later (if at all).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🪐 Narrative Astrology: Signs of a Do-er\\\n\\\n| Astrological Placement       | Interpretation                                                          |\\\n| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\n| ☉ **Libra Sun**              | Negotiator by role—but not passive. Will push when lines are crossed.   |\\\n| 🌙 **Pisces Moon**           | Emotionally sensitive, yes—but expressed through *escapism* (movement). |\\\n| ↑ **Gemini Rising**          | Responds rapidly to stimuli. Adapts externally. Persona-first survival. |\\\n| ♂ **Aries Mars** (canonical) | Direct action, instinctive aggression, fast reaction.                   |\\\n| ☿ **Scorpio Mercury**        | Controls narrative through communication—but when cornered, cuts deep.  |\\\n| ♄ **Capricorn Saturn**       | Channeling pain into systems, control, and structure—never wallowing.   |\\\n\\\nHer chart is full of **displacement strategies**: change the room, the mask, the rules—not herself.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🌌 Transits (Symbolic)\\\n\\\n* **Uranus square Moon** → *Emotions trigger disruption; she moves.*\\\n* **Mars return** → *Fights back the moment the world pushes.*\\\n* **Neptune in 10th** → *Public persona as escape from inner truth.*\\\n\\\nVivian reacts not by turning inward, but by breaking the surface.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🧠 Story Application\\\n\\\nIn **ASTRO7EX**:\\\n\\\n* Vivian **infiltrates**, **sabotages**, **steals**, **escapes**, **fucks**, **kills**, and **runs**.\\\n* She doesn’t “heal” until something external is burned down.\\\n* She is a soldier, not a mystic.\\\n* Even her **numbness** is expressed through **doing**: drug runs, sexual rituals, self-debasement.\\\n\\\nShe is not still. She is **kinetic trauma**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧘 OPTION 2: **Be-er**\\\n\\\n> “If something’s wrong, I’ll adapt. I’ll suppress. I’ll bear it until it stops.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🧠 Dramatica Theory\\\n\\\n* A **Be-er** believes the problem lies within.\\\n* They bend, delay, internalize, adjust behavior, retreat into roles or rituals.\\\n* The solution is **emotional or identity-based**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🪐 Does it fit Vivian?\\\n\\\nShe *has* Pisces Moon and Scorpio Mercury—so she *feels* like a Be-er.\\\nBut every single one of those placements is **weaponized** through behavior:\\\n\\\n* Pisces Moon fuels escapism via **action** (drugs, movement).\\\n* Scorpio Mercury is **expressed** through stabs, not silence.\\\n* Saturn in Capricorn doesn’t surrender—it **builds armor**.\\\n\\\nIf she were a Be-er, she’d be more like Myrtle: adaptive, emotional, quietly devoted.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✅ Final Determination: **Vivian is a Do-er**\\\n\\\n### She solves her internal problems by:\\\n\\\n* Breaking the system\\\n* Running from the pain\\\n* Sabotaging the past\\\n* Kicking the walls until the gods fall out\\\n\\\nEven her quiet moments (lobotomy, drugs, silence) are **actions**—desperate attempts to suppress without changing inwardly.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🎯 Thematic Power\\\n\\\nChoosing Vivian as a **Do-er** gives ASTRO7EX a survivalist spine:\\\n\\\n* **Meaning is chosen not by reflection, but by destruction.**\\\n* She refuses internal reconciliation and *does* her way into wholeness.\\\n\\\nHer **transformation isn’t personal—it’s physical**.\\\nShe doesn’t *find* the truth. She *fights* it into revealing itself.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\nLet me know when you’re ready to confirm this and move on to:\\\n\\\n> 🧠 **Mental Sex** — Does Vivian approach problems from a **linear (Male)** or **holistic (Female)** cognitive perspective?\\\n> This isn't gendered—it's **problem-solving style**.\\\n> We’ll match that to astrology and archetypal thought.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4413}]"
