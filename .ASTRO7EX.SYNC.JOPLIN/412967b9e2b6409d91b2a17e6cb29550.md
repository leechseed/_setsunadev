# 🎭 THEME CHOICE: **Overall Story Throughline Domain**

> Which best describes the **objective conflict space** for all characters?

Options:

* 🌍 **Situation**
* 🔧 **Activity**
* 🌍➕🔧 **Situation / Activity** (Situation emphasized, Activity as flavor)
* 🔧➕🌍 **Activity / Situation** (Activity emphasized, Situation as backdrop)

## 🔍 DRAMATICA THEORY OVERVIEW

The **Overall Story Throughline** defines the **objective problem space**—what the world is dealing with *from everyone’s point of view*. This is where all the roles (Protagonist, Antagonist, Contagonist, etc.) lock into a shared crisis.

### The four domains (simplified):

| Domain                 | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Situation**          | A fixed external state of affairs (e.g., being stuck in a war, prison, empire)      |
| **Activity**           | Ongoing actions or processes causing trouble (e.g., chasing, fleeing, revolting)    |
| **Situation/Activity** | Static condition with embedded movement (e.g., occupation with rebellion)           |
| **Activity/Situation** | Active process causing state-based tension (e.g., surveillance creating oppression) |

## 🧠 ASTRO7EX WORLD CONTEXT

**In ASTRO7EX**, the world features:

* A hidden lunar technocracy run by faith/corporate fusion (MORN)
* A lingering, possibly reactivated AI Godking (John Smith the Eternal)
* A broken memory economy and lobotomized resistance fighters
* Numbness, bureaucracy, neural surveillance
* “Reactivation” as the return of forbidden knowledge

All of this creates a reality where the **state of things is broken**, but not inert. Characters aren’t just running from the system—they’re caught in its **deteriorating structure**.

---

## 🌐 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION

### 🟢 **Situation**

> Fixed conditions cause conflict.
> "We are trapped in a failed utopia."

* John Smith’s AI legacy still rules aspects of human behavior.
* The ultra-Mormon church left behind its Godking seed—now metastasizing.
* Memory corruption and institutional erasure are **conditions**, not pursuits.
* The Mods and Fiona act *within* that system—they don’t challenge it structurally.

🪐 **Astrological Echo**: Saturn in Capricorn (structure), Pluto in Capricorn (systemic decay), Moon in Pisces (dissolution of identity within those structures)

---

### 🟡 **Activity**

> Ongoing processes cause tension.
> "People are doing things that create conflict."

* The lobotomies are **actions**, yes.
* The sabotage and counter-intel are kinetic.
* Vivian steals, escapes, seduces, and resists—but she’s reacting.

Activity is *happening*, but it feels like the byproduct of a larger, **rotting situation**.

---

### 🔵 **Situation / Activity**

> Best for stories where **status** is the true conflict, but action is how people respond.

Examples:

* **The Hunger Games** → The games are an activity, but the oppressive regime (Situation) is what matters.
* **1984** → The Party (Situation) creates surveillance, newspeak, rebellion, and betrayal (Activities).

🧠 In ASTRO7EX:

* The Godking is the Situation.
* The lobotomy sabotage, AI exposure, and MORN takedown attempts are **Activities**.
* The conflict is **being part of a broken system**, and the characters move *because* of that.

## 📚 HAROLD BLOOM — AMERICAN THEMES

Harold Bloom, in *The American Religion* and *The Western Canon*, identifies core American literary themes as:

* **Individual vs. System**
* **Rebellion against deterministic fate**
* **The haunted self—memory as trauma**
* **Isolation as heroism**
* **Inner salvation without collective reform**

Vivian is *deeply American* in this Bloomian sense:

* She fights systems of forgetting.
* She is a fragmented soul haunted by memory.
* Her pain is internalized—but she resists being flattened.
* She *endures*, not to save the world, but to remain **authentic** in the face of spiritual erasure.

This lines up with a **Situation-Driven Story** where action is *response*, not cause.

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION:

> **Overall Story Throughline Domain = Situation / Activity**

### Rationale:

* The world of ASTRO7EX is a **corrupted architecture**—AI religion, bureaucratic numbness, moral decay.
* **Activities (e.g., hacking, fleeing, seducing)** happen inside that structure, but they don’t define it.
* The conflict is about **living in that world**, not just running from it.

Let me know when you're ready to:

> Assign **Domains to the other three Throughlines** (Main Character, Impact Character, and Relationship Throughline)

These will connect Vivian’s internal arc, MODS' thematic pressure, and their shared battleground.
