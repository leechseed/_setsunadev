## 🧩 1. Summary Overview

The Main Character Plot Progression for *ASTRO7EX* has now been fully illustrated. Across all four Signposts and three Journeys, **Vivian's subjective experience has been mapped from her immediate crisis to a final acceptance of metamorphic reality**. The development arc aligns tightly with the Dramatica Steadfast character model: Vivian does not transform in the conventional sense, but rather *deepens her understanding and endurance of change*. Each phase sharpens her perspective and forces her into a new temporal relationship with grief, identity, and collapse.

## 🧱 2. Signpost Breakdown

### **MC Signpost 1 — *The Present***

* Vivian is caught in the aftermath of a failed heist and a corrupted world.
* Her survival is moment-to-moment: food, oxygen, betrayal.
* Anxiety, surveillance, and shellshock define her immediate concerns.

### **MC Signpost 2 — *The Past***

* Flashbacks bleed into hallucination as Vivian revisits her MAXWING indoctrination.
* Guilt and betrayal emerge as core themes—especially around Penelope and Fiona.
* The revelation that her memories may be implanted destabilizes her timeline.

### **MC Signpost 3 — *The Future***

* She begins to anticipate the DHR countdown.
* Not driven by hope, but by inevitability—she contemplates extinction, legacy, prophecy.
* Her vision of “what’s next” takes on spiritual and strategic dimensions.

### **MC Signpost 4 — *How Things Are Changing***

* Vivian becomes a mirror of the world's transformation.
* The climax isn’t in action but in *observation*—bearing witness as the system mutates.
* She reaches peace with change, ambiguity, and her own unknowability.

---

## 🧭 3. Journey Breakdown

### **MC Journey 1 — *The Present → The Past***

* Vivian begins in stasis but is pulled backward by trauma and loss.
* Her present paranoia cracks open repressed memories of indoctrination and war.
* Symbolically: from hiding to unburying.

### **MC Journey 2 — *The Past → The Future***

* After breaking through her history, she starts thinking ahead—not in terms of goals, but timelines.
* She maps prophetic paths, mythic blueprints, and the implications of the AI Collapse.
* The dead no longer haunt—they *warn*.

### **MC Journey 3 — *The Future → How Things Are Changing***

* She lets go of control or prediction.
* Instead, she tracks transformation: of herself, her comrades, the MODS, and MORN.
* Her subjective lens moves from *destination* to *direction*.

## 🧬 4. Thematic Integration

* **Bloomian Tragedy**: Vivian echoes the tragic American hero who cannot escape the myth she’s embedded in.
* **McKee’s Causality Model**: Reveals true character via **persistent response to irreversible collapse**, not epiphany.
* **Astrology**: Progressions show internal weathering, not enlightenment. Transits shake but do not reform.
* **2000s Anime**: Lain, Texhnolyze, and Ghost in the Shell — characters who become vessels of systemic awareness.
