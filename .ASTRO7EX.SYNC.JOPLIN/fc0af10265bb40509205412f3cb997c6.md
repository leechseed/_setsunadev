## Overview

Goal:
**Mic → Realtime Voice Changer → Voicemeeter → Discord**

You talk into your mic, the AI changes your voice, Voicemeeter routes that processed voice into Discord as your “mic.”

---

## Signal Flow Cheat Sheet

1. **Realtime Voice Changer**

   * Input: **Your Microphone**
   * Output: **Virtual Cable** (e.g., `CABLE Input`) *or* `Voicemeeter VAIO/AUX`

2. **Voicemeeter**

   * Input: **That same virtual device** (CABLE Output / VAIO / AUX)
   * Output (B1 or B2): **Virtual “mic” for Discord**

3. **Discord**

   * Input Device: **Voicemeeter virtual output** (e.g., `Voicemeeter Output (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)`)

---

## Step 1 – Conceptual Devices

Name them in your head so you don’t get lost:

* **Mic** – your actual microphone (whatever Windows shows: USB mic, interface, etc.).
* **Virtual Cable** – software cable like `CABLE Input / CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`.
* **Voicemeeter Inputs**

  * **Hardware Input**: where you can bring in physical or virtual devices.
  * **Virtual Input (VAIO/AUX)**: software inputs from Windows apps.
* **Voicemeeter Outputs**

  * **A1/A2/A3**: outputs to headphones/speakers.
  * **B1/B2/B3**: virtual outputs shown to other apps as “mics.”

Pick **ONE** B-bus (usually **B1**) to be “Discord mic.”

---

## Step 2 – Realtime Voice Changer

1. **Open Realtime Voice Changer.**

2. **Set Input Device**:

   * Choose your **actual mic** (whatever you normally use).

3. **Set Output Device** – pick ONE of these strategies:

   **Strategy A (with VB-Cable):**

   * Output Device = `CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`

   **Strategy B (direct to Voicemeeter):**

   * Output Device = `Voicemeeter VAIO` or `Voicemeeter AUX`

4. **Load your model/preset** inside Realtime Voice Changer.

5. Speak and confirm:

   * You see **input activity** and **output activity** meters moving inside the app.

---

## Step 3 – Voicemeeter Routing

### 3.1 If You Used Strategy A (VB-Cable)

Realtime VC Output → `CABLE Input` → (`CABLE Output` appears in Voicemeeter)

1. In **Voicemeeter**:

   * Set **Hardware Input 1** (or any free hardware input) to:
     `CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`
2. On that input strip:

   * Enable **B1** (or whichever B-bus you decided is your “Discord mic”).
   * OPTIONAL: enable **A1** so you can hear yourself through your headphones.

Result:
**Processed voice from Realtime VC** now goes into Voicemeeter, then out via **B1**.

---

### 3.2 If You Used Strategy B (Direct to Voicemeeter VAIO/AUX)

Realtime VC Output → `Voicemeeter VAIO` (or AUX)

1. In **Voicemeeter**:

   * Look at the **Virtual Input** strip labeled `Voicemeeter VAIO` (or AUX).
   * This strip should now receive audio when you talk.
2. On that virtual input strip:

   * Enable **B1** (or your chosen B-bus).
   * OPTIONAL: enable **A1** to monitor yourself.

Result:
**Processed voice from Realtime VC** hits the VAIO/AUX strip and is sent out via **B1**.

---

### 3.3 Make B1 the “Discord Mic”

In Voicemeeter:

* Confirm at the top/right section that **B1** is mapped to:
  `Voicemeeter Output (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)` or similar name.

This is what Discord will see as your microphone.

---

## Step 4 – Discord Settings

In **Discord → User Settings → Voice & Video**:

1. **Input Device**:

   * Set to: `Voicemeeter Output (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)`
     (or `Voicemeeter AUX Output` if you used AUX/B2).

2. **Output Device**:

   * Whatever you normally use to hear Discord (headphones, Voicemeeter, etc.).

3. Under **Input Sensitivity**:

   * Turn OFF “Automatically determine input sensitivity.”
   * Set the slider so normal speech passes easily, but background noise does not cut in/out.

4. Under **Advanced**:

   * Echo cancellation, noise reduction, etc. may **distort AI voices**.
   * If your voice sounds crushed or unstable, try disabling:

     * Noise Suppression
     * Echo Cancellation
     * Automatic Gain Control

---

## Step 5 – Test & Fine-Tune

1. In Discord:

   * Use **“Let’s Check” / “Mic Test”** or join a private voice channel alone.
2. Speak:

   * Check meters in **Realtime Voice Changer → Voicemeeter → Discord**:

     * Realtime VC: input + output meters move.
     * Voicemeeter: chosen input strip shows signal; B1 bus shows signal.
     * Discord: input level bar moves.
3. Adjust:

   * Use **Voicemeeter’s fader** on the AI input strip to set loudness.
   * Do **NOT** crank Windows mic levels and Voicemeeter both to 100%; balance them.

If friends say you’re too loud/quiet:

* Adjust the **strip fader in Voicemeeter**, not Discord input sensitivity.

---

## Common Issues

* **No sound in Discord, but Realtime VC works:**

  * Check Voicemeeter:

    * Is the correct input strip active (CABLE/VAIO)?
    * Is **B1** lit on that strip?
  * Check Discord:

    * Input Device = **Voicemeeter Output**, not your raw mic or CABLE.

* **You hear yourself twice / with echo:**

  * Disable any **“Listen to this device”** in Windows Sound settings.
  * Make sure only **ONE path** is monitoring to your headphones (e.g., just A1 from Voicemeeter).

* **Latency feels bad:**

  * Lower buffer sizes in Voicemeeter and Realtime VC **gradually** until you get crackling, then bump it slightly back up.
  * Keep all sample rates consistent (e.g., 48 kHz everywhere).

* **Friends say your voice is cutting in/out:**

  * In Discord, loosen input sensitivity or disable noise suppression.
  * Make sure your AI output isn’t too quiet before it hits Discord (raise in Voicemeeter).
