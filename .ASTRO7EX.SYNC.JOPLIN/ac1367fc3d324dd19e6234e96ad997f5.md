In the narrative‚Äôs architecture, \\\"Doing\\\" plays the role of observable execution‚Äîcharacters must engage in specific behaviors, missions, rituals, and procedural tasks that escalate both thematic tension and moral reckoning. These visible actions‚Äîoften chaotic, painful, or ritualistic‚Äîunveil the psychological and metaphysical scaffolding of the world.\\\n\\\nThroughout ASTRO7EX, \\\"Doing\\\" becomes the performance layer of truth-finding. Understanding can only arise if specific, impossible tasks are completed: surviving deadly environments, opening sealed archives, committing crimes against protocol, etc. Each character's participation in these acts reveals whether their efforts are driven by memory, obligation, control, or meaning.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üîç Definition and Role of Story Requirements\\\n\\\n### **Dramatica Context**\\\n\\\n* **Story Requirements** define what must happen within the plot in order for the Story Goal to be fulfilled.\\\n* \\\"Doing\\\" is one of the four Types in the Activity (Physics) Domain. It centers on physical effort, execution, and actions in motion.\\\n\\\n### **Narrative Role in ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n* The requirement of *Doing* gives the plot a scaffold of missions, performances, transgressions, and tasks.\\\n* Success in these actions validates movement toward the Story Goal of *Understanding*.\\\n* Failure in \\\"Doing\\\" leads to consequences taking over (Developing a Plan), implying reliance on procedure instead of insight.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üé≠ Thematic Framing of \\\"Doing\\\"\\\n\\\n### **The Soul of Screenplay ‚Äî Keith Cunningham**\\\n\\\n* Cunningham writes that action is *\\\"a revelation of identity\\\"*. In ASTRO7EX, actions are externalized trauma responses. Each task is a confessional.\\\n\\\n### **Writing Deep Scenes**\\\n\\\n* Alderson and Rosenfeld advise that key scenes must escalate tension through physicality. In ASTRO7EX, most actions are not just consequential‚Äîthey‚Äôre irreversible. Doing reshapes the world.\\\n\\\n### **Harold Bloom**\\\n\\\n* Bloom‚Äôs concept of the American mythos suggests that action in literature is often a proxy for *self-invention*. Characters in ASTRO7EX attempt to remake themselves through what they do.\\\n\\\n### **2000s Sci-Fi Anime Tropes**\\\n\\\n* Mecha pilots, hacking duels, or ritual combat are not just spectacle‚Äîthey externalize inner conflict. In ASTRO7EX, the physical acts (breaking open tombs, jacking into dead systems, performing ghost protocols) reflect characters grappling with memory, identity, and oblivion.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ü™ê ASTRO7EX Expression: Doing as Praxis\\\n\\\n### **Examples of \\\"Doing\\\" Requirements in the Plot**\\\n\\\n* **Vivian physically retrieves memory-traced brain stems** from her lobotomized allies, unlocking key truths embedded in flesh.\\\n* **Myrtle completes a moonbase-sidewalk ritual**, reenacting a now-illegal archive breach, to reveal hidden data seams.\\\n* **Nacho disables a DHR Protocol Valve** using analog sabotage, betraying his logical programming to serve emotional allegiance.\\\n* **Fiona publicly streams a banned sermon**, performing a sacrilege of protocol as an act of rebellious doing.\\\n* **MODS appear only through their performance layers**‚Äîin code traces, broadcasts, simulated repairs. Their \\\"Doing\\\" is only interface.\\\n* **The Committee executes its one and only unanimous vote**, a gesture so rare and formalized it constitutes a kind of action-litany.\\\n\\\n### **Structure of \\\"Doing\\\" in ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n1. **Act I** ‚Äî Doing is indirect: surveillance, retrievals, experimentation.\\\n2. **Act II** ‚Äî Doing becomes direct: infiltration, sabotage, subversion.\\\n3. **Act III** ‚Äî Doing turns into ceremony: rites, betrayals, live-broadcast martyrdoms.\\\n4. **Act IV** ‚Äî Doing is existential: characters either act in truth or calcify into silence.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üé¨ Scene-Level Integration\\\n\\\n### **Key Sequences Illustrating Doing**\\\n\\\n* **The Descent into Vault 88**: Fiona and Vivian must perform specific movements to unlock ghost-tethered AI code‚Äîliteral physical performance unlocking symbolic data.\\\n* **Nacho‚Äôs Analog Heist**: Takes place entirely without digital traces‚Äîaction as denial of surveillance.\\\n* **MODS‚Äôs System Purge Broadcast**: An act of bureaucratic cleansing posing as salvation.\\\n\\\n### **Symbolic Metaphors**\\\n\\\n* Actions must be completed *outside systems of validation*‚Äî\\\"Doing\\\" without recognition becomes holy.\\\n* Characters experience entropy unless they enact something‚Äîinaction is death in ASTRO7EX.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üìö Sources and Reinforcements\\\n\\\n* **Robert McKee ‚Äì *Story***: Emphasizes that action = meaning under pressure. The action must threaten identity.\\\n* **Karl Iglesias ‚Äì *Writing for Emotional Impact***: Describes action as emotion made visible. Stakes in ASTRO7EX are often defined not by outcome but by how much the character bleeds for the task.\\\n* **Joseph Campbell**: Every hero must face trials; these tasks are not symbolic‚Äîthey are *performed.*\\\n* **Narrative Astrology ‚Äì Transits & Progressions**:\\\n\\\n  * **Saturn Return Transit**: Forces characters to *do* something with consequences.\\\n  * **Mars Transits**: Drive the characters toward action regardless of emotional state.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ‚úÖ Conclusion\\\n\\\nThe exposition of the Story Requirement *Doing* will be presented through escalating acts of physical, symbolic, and existential performance. These actions create friction with the world‚Äôs rules and drive characters toward revelation and collapse. In ASTRO7EX, doing is not just movement‚Äîit‚Äôs *commitment*. Each deed‚Äîespecially when done in secret, in defiance, or in pain‚Äîbecomes a rung toward *Understanding*. The audience will recognize that what characters are willing to do without reward defines their spiritual alignment, their emotional reality, and their narrative fate.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6441}]"
