The 12 Basic Components of Story

# The Leechseed Manifesto  
## SECTION: Narrative Doctrine  
## TITLE: The 12 Basic Components of Story

---

### **Overview**

This doctrine outlines the **12 foundational components** required to construct a fully functional story. Each component operates as an independent structural pillar—no one piece substitutes for another. A story missing any of these is incomplete, unbalanced, or ineffective. These are not tropes or beats. These are the *non-negotiables*.

---

### **1. Protagonist**

**Definition**  
The primary character through whom the audience experiences the story. They are the center of gravity around which narrative decisions revolve.

**Requirements**  
- Must have agency: passive protagonists break momentum.  
- Must have a goal or desire.  
- Must face internal or external pressure that forces growth, adaptation, or collapse.

**Function**  
The protagonist is not the hero—they are the decision-maker, the sacrifice-maker, the vessel for transformation.

---

### **2. Antagonist**

**Definition**  
The force or entity opposing the protagonist’s goal. This can be a person, institution, environment, or inner demon.

**Requirements**  
- Must generate meaningful resistance.  
- Should reflect or contrast the protagonist’s values.

**Function**  
The antagonist applies pressure. Without opposition, there is no change, no story—only wandering.

---

### **3. Plot**

**Definition**  
The sequence of events that forms the spine of the story. It converts raw character and concept into narrative movement.

**Core Elements**  
- Inciting Incident  
- Rising Action  
- Climax  
- Falling Action  
- Resolution

**Function**  
Plot provides structure. It is *what happens*—not what it means, not how it’s told. A story without plot is a shapeless idea.

---

### **4. Conflict**

**Definition**  
The central tension that drives the narrative forward.

**Types**  
- External: enemy, nature, society, fate  
- Internal: guilt, fear, identity  
- Philosophical: truth vs. illusion, freedom vs. control

**Function**  
Conflict generates stakes. It forces the protagonist into motion and gives meaning to their decisions.

---

### **5. Goal**

**Definition**  
The specific, tangible outcome the protagonist wants.

**Requirements**  
- Must be clear to the audience.  
- Must be threatened by the conflict.  
- Must carry emotional or moral weight.

**Function**  
The goal drives the plot. Without it, the story has no vector—only drifting scenes.

---

### **6. Setting**

**Definition**  
The time, place, and environment where the story unfolds.

**Layers**  
- Physical (e.g., desert, spaceship)  
- Cultural (e.g., 90s America, alien empire)  
- Psychological (e.g., oppressive, surreal)

**Function**  
Setting is not backdrop—it’s pressure. It shapes behavior and enables or obstructs character decisions.

---

### **7. Theme**

**Definition**  
The abstract idea or question being explored beneath the surface of the plot.

**Examples**  
- “Can justice exist without vengeance?”  
- “Does love survive death?”  
- “What is freedom?”

**Function**  
Theme gives the story weight. It transforms plot into purpose.

---

### **8. Character Arc**

**Definition**  
The internal evolution or devolution of the protagonist.

**Types**  
- Positive Arc: from broken to whole  
- Negative Arc: from noble to damned  
- Flat Arc: unchanged but a source of change for others

**Function**  
The arc proves theme. It's where consequence becomes character.

---

### **9. Point of View**

**Definition**  
The narrative lens through which the audience accesses the story.

**Forms**  
- First person (“I”)  
- Third person limited (“he/she” with access to one mind)  
- Omniscient (unlimited access)  
- Unreliable (distorted or subjective)

**Function**  
POV controls information, tension, and audience intimacy.

---

### **10. Tone**

**Definition**  
The emotional attitude of the narrative.

**Examples**  
- Cynical  
- Whimsical  
- Tragic  
- Detached  
- Ecstatic

**Function**  
Tone sets expectations and creates cohesion across scenes.

---

### **11. Style**

**Definition**  
The aesthetic texture of the writing—its rhythm, structure, vocabulary, and sensory effect.

**Components**  
- Sentence construction  
- Word choice  
- Use of metaphor  
- Pacing

**Function**  
Style is how the story feels in the reader’s brain.

---

### **12. Voice**

**Definition**  
The distinct narrative presence that emerges from the intersection of diction, worldview, tone, and personality.

**Sources**  
- The narrator  
- The author  
- The text itself as a constructed presence

**Function**  
Voice is what makes a story unmistakably yours. It is the fingerprint, the vibe, the soulprint of the narrative.

---

### **Final Principle**

> **All 12 components must exist in tension.**  
> A brilliant plot without theme is hollow. A vivid voice without conflict is self-indulgent.  
> These components are not ingredients. They are structural load-bearers.  
> **Remove one, and the story collapses.**
