It is not a surprise for surprise’s sake. It is a resolution forged through conflict, decision, transformation, and sacrifice. The audience doesn’t just witness it—they *feel* it, because they’ve taken every step of the journey to arrive there.\\\n\\\n**An unearned climax is narrative betrayal. An earned climax is narrative salvation.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Table of Contents**\\\n\\\n1. [Core Purpose](#core-purpose)\\\n2. [Structural Positioning](#structural-positioning)\\\n3.

It concludes the protagonist’s journey, ties off major arcs, and drives home the meaning of the story.\\\n\\\n```mermaid\\\nflowchart TD\\\n    A[Act I: Setup] --> B[Act II: Confrontation] -->
