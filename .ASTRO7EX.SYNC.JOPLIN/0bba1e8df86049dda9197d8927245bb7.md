# CREATE “ESSENCE STATEMENTS” — Personality One-Liners

Refine your character and setting descriptions by condensing them into vivid, personality-filled one-liners.

---

### **Worksheet Template**
- **Main Character Essence Statement:**  
  > (One-line description capturing personality, tone, or defining trait)

- **Supporting Character Essence Statement:**  
  > (One-liner that quickly conveys voice, role, or energy)

- **Antagonist Essence Statement:**  
  > (Punchy line that defines presence, motive, or menace)

---

### **Example Snips**
- **Main Character:** *A dreamer in a leather jacket who runs on caffeine and bad decisions.*  
- **Supporting Character:** *A chatterbox mechanic who never met a conspiracy theory he didn’t like.*  
- **Antagonist:** *A smiling shark in a tailored suit who never raises his voice but always gets his way.*

### **Essence Statement Log**
| Character Role | Essence Statement (One-Liner) | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Main           |                               |       |
| Supporting     |                               |       |
| Antagonist     |                               |       |
| Other          |                               |       |

---

### **Checklist**
- [ ] Each essence statement is **one line only**.  
- [ ] Personality shines through in **voice, rhythm, or metaphor**.  
- [ ] No generic descriptions (avoid “nice,” “strong,” “pretty”).  
- [ ] Statements **set tone** and hint at **story role**.
