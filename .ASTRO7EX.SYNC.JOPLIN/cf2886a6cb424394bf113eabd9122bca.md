## Purpose & Core Premise
This is a **four-pole power system** where each power is:
- **A real metaphysical resource**
- **A worldview in action**
- **A social apparatus (or anti-apparatus)**
- **A narrative engine** (it generates conflict, factions, moral pressure, and irreversible consequences)

The four are designed to feel like **true equals**:
- Not “elements”
- Not “spell lists”
- Not “vibes”
- But **competing ontologies** that produce distinct kinds of power, legitimacy, and failure.

---

## The Definition of “Power” in This IP
**Power** is a supernatural force that:
- **Changes outcomes** (not just perceptions)
- **Rearranges meaning** (not just matter)
- **Creates obligations** (not just effects)
- **Leaves a trace** (social, metaphysical, or causal)

Power in this setting is less “fireball” and more:
- *authorization, revelation, fabrication, inevitability*
- *blessing, unlock, build, proc*

---

## DSRP Frame

### Distinctions
Four powers, each defined as a one-line “having” statement:
- **She has Grace**: she is *inhabited/authorized* by a higher good.
- **She has Gnosis**: she *knows the hidden structure* and can route around the lie.
- **She has Technae**: she can *make reality yield* through craft-as-revelation.
- **She has Wyrd**: she is *entangled with outcome*—the glitch that arrives already solved.

### Systems
Power exists as a system with:
- **Source** (where it “comes from”)
- **Channel** (how it moves)
- **Credential** (who counts as real)
- **Practice** (how it’s trained)
- **Failure mode** (how it collapses)
- **Institution** (who governs it—or fails to)

### Relationships
Powers are **not symmetric opposites**. They’re **natural enemies** in specific pairings:
- Grace vs Gnosis: *obedience to the true good* vs *escape through secret knowing*
- Technae vs Wyrd: *repeatable making* vs *non-repeatable happening*
- Grace vs Technae: *gift* vs *construction*
- Gnosis vs Wyrd: *pattern-recognition* vs *pattern-negation*

### Perspectives
Each power “interprets” the others in a way that creates factional conflict:
- Grace calls Gnosis pride and schism.
- Gnosis calls Grace captivity and fake godhood.
- Technae calls both religious systems inefficient mythology.
- Wyrd calls all three “trying too hard” and then accidentally topples empires.

## The Four Powers

## Grace
**Definition**: A bestowed supernatural life/authorization that makes a person capable of *holy alignment* and sanctioned action.

**Core Image**: A seal, a light, an indwelling.

**How it “has” you**:
- You don’t *take* Grace; you are **given** Grace.
- Grace is **membership in a higher order**, not merely personal talent.

**What it does (in-world)**
- **Sanctions**: makes certain acts “count” metaphysically.
- **Purifies**: reduces corruption, breaks spiritual contamination.
- **Consecrates**: transforms objects/places into protected jurisdictions.
- **Intercedes**: creates improbable protection that feels *lawful* rather than random.

**Costs**
- **Obligation**: Grace creates duties; refusal degrades it.
- **Purity pressure**: you can’t carry certain stains without consequences.
- **Institutional capture**: apparatuses will attempt to own your Grace.

**Primary failure state**
- **Desolation**: loss of indwelling; the “light” stops recognizing you.

---

## Gnosis
**Definition**: Direct salvific knowing—an experiential cognition that exposes the world’s hidden architecture and enables escape from false structures.

**Core Image**: A key, a fracture, a map behind the map.

**How it “has” you**
- You don’t receive Gnosis as permission; you **awaken** into it.
- Gnosis is **anti-credential**: your knowing invalidates external authority.

**What it does (in-world)**
- **Reveals**: you perceive the “operators” behind reality (archons, scripts, masks, false laws).
- **Unbinds**: breaks glamour, doctrinal traps, memetic seals.
- **Routes**: you find side-doors in systems (metaphysical exploits).
- **Remembers**: you recover identity fragments that the world is designed to suppress.

**Costs**
- **Alienation**: institutions treat you as infection.
- **Over-clarity**: too much seeing can erase ordinary meaning.
- **Predation**: secret societies want to weaponize your awakenings.

**Primary failure state**
- **Hypertrophy of insight**: “knowing” becomes sterile; you can’t live, only dissect.

---

## Technae
**Definition**: Power-through-making—craft as a mode of revealing that forces the world to become legible and usable under deliberate construction.

**Core Image**: A forge, a diagram, a machine-prayer.

**How it “has” you**
- Technae is **repeatability**.
- If you can’t reproduce it, it isn’t Technae—it’s luck, prophecy, or fraud.

**What it does (in-world)**
- **Embodies**: turns metaphysical truths into artifacts, rites, engines, protocols.
- **Stabilizes**: makes volatile forces safe, modular, distributable.
- **Amplifies**: tools scale power beyond the individual.
- **Defines**: if you can build it, you can bound it.

**Costs**
- **Debt to process**: shortcuts create rot.
- **Arms race**: Technae escalates conflict because it scales.
- **Bureaucracy**: guilds and standards bodies will strangle innovation for control.

**Primary failure state**
- **Technic rot**: systems keep running while meaning dies (a dead machine that still “works”).

---

## Wyrd
**Definition**: Fate-as-event—an outcome-bearing force that manifests as non-repeatable convergence, “glitches,” and inevitabilities that only make sense in retrospect.

**Core Image**: A crow, a stray coin, a wrong turn that becomes history.

**How it “has” you**
- Wyrd is not owned. It **happens through you**.
- It is **anti-method**: attempts to systematize it provoke misfire.

**What it does (in-world)**
- **Procs**: improbable timing, perfect accidents, catastrophic comedy.
- **Selects**: puts people on rails without telling them where the rails go.
- **Converges**: pulls threads together across distance, time, factions, plans.
- **Negates**: breaks systems precisely at their point of arrogance.

**Costs**
- **Unclaimability**: you can’t prove it, replicate it, or reliably summon it.
- **Persecution**: apparatuses demonize Wyrd because it humiliates governance.
- **Backwash**: Wyrd “wins” but leaves collateral you must carry.

**Primary failure state**
- **False patterning**: when you start explaining Wyrd like a system, it stops being Wyrd and becomes delusion or manipulation.

**Your interpretation check**
What you described—Wyrd as the ridiculed underdog power, the “idiot hero” gravity-well, the cosmic levity, the glitch/serendipity engine—tracks **extremely well** with how wyrd is often felt in narrative: an impersonal force that can look like randomness, providence, or doom depending on who’s speaking.
- The key to keep it coherent: **Wyrd is not chaos. It is outcome without method.**
- Wyrd is feared because it implies: *your control systems are not real—only your results are.*

---

## Power Governance & Apparatuses
Each power gets a social machine that attempts to:
- define legitimacy
- gatekeep practice
- monopolize interpretation
- punish failure states

### Ecclesial Apparatus (Grace)
**Institution type**: Church-state metaphysical bureaucracy.

**Primary governance tools**
- **Sacramental channels**: recognized “pipes” that confer and sustain Grace.
- **Hierarchy**: ranked custody of doctrine and authority.
- **Canon discipline**: penalties for unauthorized practice.
- **Jurisdiction**: consecrated zones where Grace is stronger and enforceable.

**Failure pressures**
- Schism, simony, politicization, “Grace as credential.”

### Mystery Apparatus (Gnosis)
**Institution type**: Cult cells, secret schools, scripture-fragment networks.

**Primary governance tools**
- **Initiation ladders**: staged disclosure.
- **Ciphers & rites**: knowledge encoded as practice.
- **Textual relics**: fragments that “wake” people.
- **Counter-inquisition**: internal policing against infiltrators and false awakenings.

**Failure pressures**
- Paranoia, narcissism of insight, factional splintering.

### Guild Apparatus (Technae)
**Institution type**: Lodges, guilds, labs, standards councils.

**Primary governance tools**
- **Apprenticeship**: skill and secrecy transfer.
- **Certification**: “this artifact counts.”
- **Patents/charters**: political protection of methods.
- **Quality law**: rot-control, audits, recalls, blacklists.

**Failure pressures**
- Monopoly, stagnation, weaponization, technocratic tyranny.

### Anti-Apparatus (Wyrd)
**Institution type**: No stable institution—only *circulation*.

**What replaces institutions**
- **Pilgrimage**: movement as a “school.”
- **Folklore protocols**: sayings, taboos, lucky rules that are half-joke, half-true.
- **Holy fools / idiot heroes**: socially low-status carriers of high-impact outcome.
- **Oracles by accident**: people who are right for the wrong reasons.

**Failure pressures**
- Co-optation attempts (“we can train Wyrd” → immediate disaster)
- Scapegoating (“Wyrd caused it” → pogroms)
- Counterfeit wyrd (con artists mimicking fate)

---

## Operational Mechanics

### Acquisition
- **Grace**: bestowed through recognized channels, moral alignment, consecrated contact.
- **Gnosis**: awakening via encounter with forbidden truth, inner rupture, lived revelation.
- **Technae**: trained capability + artifacts + repeatable methods.
- **Wyrd**: entanglement—often triggered by refusal to play the normal game.

### Use Verbs
- **Grace**: bless, consecrate, absolve, sanctify, intercede, seal
- **Gnosis**: unveil, decode, unbind, remember, bypass, exorcise the false
- **Technae**: forge, bind, calibrate, encode, stabilize, replicate
- **Wyrd**: proc, converge, derail, echo, select, overturn

### Costs & Corruption
Every power has a signature “spiritual injury”:
- **Grace injury**: hypocrisy, legalism, “credential holiness,” desolation
- **Gnosis injury**: sterile insight, contempt, obsession, schism addiction
- **Technae injury**: rot, automation without meaning, escalation, technocratic cruelty
- **Wyrd injury**: collateral destiny, incoherence, scapegoating, self-mythologizing

### Detection & Counterplay
- **Grace detection**: consecrated tests, relic resonance, jurisdictional response
- **Gnosis detection**: memetic tells, pattern breaks, archon alarms, cipher literacy
- **Technae detection**: signature engineering traces, artifact audits, repeatable proofs
- **Wyrd detection**: you can’t *detect* it reliably—only notice the wake (synchronicities, improbable convergences, post-event certainty)

Counterplay philosophy:
- Grace counters Gnosis by **declaring it illegitimate** and severing channels.
- Gnosis counters Grace by **exposing the apparatus** as a prison.
- Technae counters both by **industrializing** their miracles.
- Wyrd counters all by **humiliating prediction**.

## Continuity-Safe Expansion Slots
These are “blank sockets” you can fill later without breaking the framework.

### Universal sockets (apply to each power)
- **[Rite Ladder]**: 3–7 stages of training/initiation
- **[Credential]**: what counts as “real” power use
- **[Artifact Class]**: 5–12 signature items
- **[Taboo Set]**: 5–12 prohibitions that cause power decay
- **[Saints/Exemplars]**: 3–9 archetypal figures per power
- **[Heresies/Counterfeits]**: how the power gets faked or corrupted
- **[Jurisdictions]**: where the power is stronger/weaker and why
- **[Adjudication]**: how disputes are settled (trial, duel, audit, omen)

### Cross-power sockets (conflict engines)
- **[Conversion Rules]**: what it takes to move from one power to another (rare, costly, story-level)
- **[Hybrid Exceptions]**: edge-cases where two powers appear in one person (define as scandalous anomalies)
- **[Null State]**: what “powerless” actually means (and how terrifying that is)
- **[Anti-Power Tech]**: tools/rites that suppress powers (inquisition tech, archon nets, rot fields, omen cages)

---

## Story Utility
This framework is built to generate:
- **Institutional conflict** (governance vs charisma)
- **Personal identity stakes** (what kind of “having” are you?)
- **Moral injury** (each power has a distinct corruption pattern)
- **Escalation without “bigger fireballs”** (power scales via legitimacy, tools, and outcome)
- **Comedy without breaking tone** (Wyrd provides levity *as a terror mechanism*)

A simple narrative rule:
> When a character “wins” with a power, they also inherit that power’s *obligation and injury*.
