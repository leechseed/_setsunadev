This assumes: you’re starting from zero, you’re going hard, and the goal is cinematic output + music-driven visuals.\\\n\\\nI’m going to lay this out in terms of:\\\n\\\n1. Setup (hardware, install, config)\\\n2. Daily Drills with exact button-level actions\\\n3. Skill Ladder with pass/fail criteria\\\n4. Output expectations by checkpoint\\\n\\\nYou run it like reps. No vibes. Do the reps.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 1. SYSTEM SETUP (DO THIS FIRST)\\\n\\\n### 1.1 Hardware Baseline\\\n\\\n* GPU: 3090 / 4090 class or equivalent VRAM (24GB+ is ideal). Less VRAM = still doable, but you’ll downscale.\\\n* RAM: 32GB minimum.\\\n* Storage: SSD/NVMe with at least 200GB free.\\\n* CPU: 8+ core modern CPU.\\\n\\\nReason: UE5 uses real-time global illumination (Lumen) + high-poly streaming (Nanite). You want headroom so you’re not fighting stutter instead of learning.\\\n\\\n### 1.2 Install Order\\\n\\\n1. Install Epic Games Launcher.\\\n2. Install Unreal Engine 5 (current stable, not Preview/Beta).\\\n3. Open Unreal once, let it shaders-cache. Don’t skip this.\\\n4. Install DaVinci Resolve (for edit/grade).\\\n5. (Optional future step, not needed day 1) Install Blender.\\\n\\\n### 1.3 Folder Structure (create this before touching anything)\\\n\\\nMake a main workspace directory. Example:\\\n\\\n```\\\n/PROJECTS\\\n    /UE5_SCENES\\\n        /YYYY-MM-DD_[scene_name]/\\\n    /RENDERS\\\n        /YYYY-MM-DD_[scene_name]/\\\n    /AUDIO\\\n        /[track_name].wav\\\n    /LOGS\\\n        /YYYY-MM-DD_notes.md\\\n```\\\n\\\nWhy:\\\n\\\n* Every experiment gets archived.\\\n* You will review growth, not vibes. We are logging evolution.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 2. DAILY DRILLS (MECHANICAL REPETITION)\\\n\\\nEach daily session has 5 drills. You do them in order. You don’t skip.\\\n\\\n### DRILL 1: LEVEL + CAMERA BOOT\\\n\\\n**Goal:** You need to be able to generate a shootable scene in under 15 minutes from a blank start. This is muscle memory.\\\n\\\nSteps:\\\n\\\n1. Launch Unreal → “Games” → “Blank” or “Third Person.” Doesn’t matter, pick one and stick to it for the week to avoid decision tax.\\\n2. Name project `YYYY-MM-DD_sceneName`.\\\n3. In the Content Browser, right-click → Create Level → name it `main_level`.\\\n4. Open `main_level`.\\\n5. Place a `CineCameraActor` in the scene (Place Actors panel → Cinematic → Cine Camera Actor).\\\n6. Add a `Directional Light` (if not already present).\\\n7. Add a `Sky Atmosphere`, `Volumetric Fog` / `Exponential Height Fog` if not present.\\\n8. Position the camera somewhere that actually frames something, not default void.\\\n9. Hit Play, stop Play. Just confirm it runs without red errors.\\\n\\\nTarget time: < 15 min once you’ve done it a few times.\\\n\\\nPass condition: You can always end Drill 1 with “I have a lit level and a camera pointing at something real, not gray checker garbage.”\\\n\\\n### DRILL 2: LIGHTING + LOOK\\\n\\\n**Goal:** You control emotional tone with lighting and post-process. You don’t guess. You set mood on purpose.\\\n\\\nSteps:\\\n\\\n1. Select `Directional Light`:\\\n\\\n   * Rotate it until you get a strong shadow angle.\\\n   * Change light color temperature (warm/orange vs cold/blue).\\\n   * Lower intensity until contrast looks intentional (not blown out).\\\n2. Add/adjust `Exponential Height Fog`:\\\n\\\n   * Increase Fog Density slightly to see volume.\\\n   * Add a Fog Inscattering Color to tint the air (this is basically your “atmosphere color grade”).\\\n3. Add a `PostProcessVolume`:\\\n\\\n   * Set it to `Infinite Extent (Unbound)` so it affects everything.\\\n   * In the PostProcessVolume settings: adjust Exposure (lock it manually so it stops auto-correcting), tweak Contrast, Saturation.\\\n   * Add slight Vignette if you want focal draw.\\\n4. In `CineCameraActor`:\\\n\\\n   * Change Focal Length (e.g. 24mm vs 85mm) to alter mood.\\\n   * Enable Depth of Field: rack focus on a specific object, blur the rest.\\\n\\\nTarget time: < 30 min.\\\n\\\nPass condition: You produce 1 still frame (viewport screenshot is fine) that you would screenshot and keep. It has an emotional feel. “Looks like a film still,” not “looks like default Unreal.”\\\n\\\nIf you wouldn’t screenshot it, you didn’t pass. Keep adjusting.\\\n\\\n### DRILL 3: SEQUENCER / CAMERA MOVE\\\n\\\n**Goal:** You animate a shot and output motion, not just a still.\\\n\\\nSteps:\\\n\\\n1. Window → Cinematics → “Add Level Sequence.”\\\n2. Name it `shot_001`.\\\n3. Open Sequencer.\\\n4. Click `+ Track` → “Actor to Sequencer” → choose your `CineCameraActor`.\\\n5. Move playhead to frame 0. With camera selected, hit the keyframe buttons for Transform.\\\n6. Move playhead to ~100 frames (or 4 seconds if timeline’s in seconds).\\\n7. Move the camera forward / dolly / orbit / tilt / whatever you want.\\\n8. Keyframe again.\\\n9. Scrub. You should now see a smooth camera move between those two keyframes.\\\n\\\nBonus: add a Cut Track and create 2 different cameras. This simulates editing.\\\n\\\nTarget time: < 45 min.\\\n\\\nPass condition: You have a moving shot in Sequencer with intentional camera motion (not just “slow drift,” unless slow drift is the choice). You understand how to set and adjust keyframes without guessing.\\\n\\\n### DRILL 4: AUDIO SYNC / RHYTHM MARKING\\\n\\\n**Goal:** You stop cutting random. You start cutting with intent.\\\n\\\nSteps:\\\n\\\n1. Import a .wav of your music/sound into the project (drag into Content Browser).\\\n2. In Sequencer: `+ Track` → Audio Track → drop the .wav onto timeline.\\\n3. Zoom in on waveform. Identify strong hits / drops.\\\n4. Add camera cuts or light intensity changes exactly on those hits:\\\n\\\n   * For lighting: keyframe light intensity or fog color at beat moments.\\\n   * For camera: cut to another camera on the hit.\\\n5. Scrub through and watch it with audio.\\\n\\\nWhat you’re doing here is training neural linkage between sound energy and visual motion/intensity. That’s core to music video work.\\\n\\\nTarget time: < 60 min.\\\n\\\nPass condition: You can point at a frame and say “the perspective changes HERE because the song hit HERE.” If it’s arbitrary, you fail.\\\n\\\n### DRILL 5: RENDER PIPELINE\\\n\\\n**Goal:** You close the loop. No render = not real.\\\n\\\nSteps:\\\n\\\n1. Go to Window → Cinematics → Movie Render Queue (don’t use the old “Render Movie” button unless you absolutely have to).\\\n2. Add your Level Sequence (`shot_001`).\\\n3. Output Settings:\\\n\\\n   * Format: Image Sequence (PNG or EXR) or Video.\\\n   * Resolution: 1920x1080 for now. Don’t get precious about 4K at the start.\\\n   * Folder: `/RENDERS/YYYY-MM-DD_sceneName/shot_001/`.\\\n4. Render.\\\n5. Bring the render into DaVinci Resolve.\\\n6. Drop it on a timeline with the same audio track.\\\n7. Export MP4.\\\n\\\nPass condition: You end session with a watchable clip with synced audio that lives in `/RENDERS/DATE_sceneName`.\\\n\\\nYou are stockpiling proof of work.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 3. SKILL LADDER (PASS/FAIL CRITERIA)\\\n\\\nYou move to the next stage only when you can do ALL of the below without external help.\\\n\\\n### LEVEL 0 → LEVEL 1: “I can operate the engine”\\\n\\\nPass checklist:\\\n\\\n* I can launch UE5, create a project, make a new Level.\\\n* I can place a camera and light and move them.\\\n* I can create a Level Sequence and animate a camera.\\\n* I can render a clip and bring it into Resolve.\\\n\\\nIf yes → You’re Level 1.\\\n\\\n### LEVEL 1 → LEVEL 2: “I can create mood”\\\n\\\nPass checklist:\\\n\\\n* I can control lighting intensity/color without guessing.\\\n* I can add fog and post-process to create a vibe on purpose.\\\n* I can frame a subject with DOF so the shot doesn’t look like raw gameplay.\\\n* I can do a 10–20 second shot that looks like a cinematic, not a tech demo.\\\n\\\nIf yes → You’re Level 2.\\\n\\\n### LEVEL 2 → LEVEL 3: “I can build a set and shoot it”\\\n\\\nPass checklist:\\\n\\\n* I can block out an environment (room, alley, rooftop, forest).\\\n* I can dress it using assets so it doesn’t look empty.\\\n* I can do at least 3 angles in that one environment that all look different (wide establishing / medium / detail).\\\n* I can relight that same environment for at least 2 different moods (e.g. moody blue night vs. dirty sodium orange).\\\n\\\nIf yes → You’re Level 3.\\\n\\\n### LEVEL 3 → LEVEL 4: “I can sync visuals to sound”\\\n\\\nPass checklist:\\\n\\\n* I can import audio, line up visual events (cuts, camera hits, light shifts) on beat accents.\\\n* I can generate a 30–60 second sequence with multiple shots timed to a track.\\\n* That cut doesn’t visually drift; it feels synced when watched, not random.\\\n\\\nIf yes → You’re Level 4.\\\n\\\n### LEVEL 4 → LEVEL 5: “I can run a pipeline”\\\n\\\nPass checklist:\\\n\\\n* I have a ‘starter scene’ template project with:\\\n\\\n  * Default lighting rig I like\\\n  * A CineCameraActor already in\\\n  * A PostProcessVolume with baseline grade\\\n  * Sequencer with tracks ready\\\n* I can go from blank idea → rendered clip → graded export in under one day, alone.\\\n* I am naming and archiving my outputs systematically.\\\n* I am not starting projects from scratch like a rookie every time.\\\n\\\nIf yes → You’re Level 5.\\\n\\\nLevel 5 is “I am now a functioning one-person cinematic unit.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 4. OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS BY CHECKPOINT\\\n\\\nHere’s what you should be producing at each phase, no excuses:\\\n\\\n### After ~2 weeks of reps:\\\n\\\n* 5–10 second clips\\\n* Static environment + moving camera\\\n* Simple lighting/color decisions\\\n* No story, just mood\\\n\\\nThis proves you can technically drive UE5 and render.\\\n\\\n### After ~1 month of reps:\\\n\\\n* 20–30 second mini-cinematics\\\n* Multiple shots/editing inside Sequencer\\\n* Synced to actual music hits\\\n* Clear emotional tone (lonely / violent / ascendant / ritual / corrupted, etc.)\\\n\\\nThis proves you’re not doing tech tests. You’re doing direction.\\\n\\\n### After ~2–3 months of reps:\\\n\\\n* 60–120 second sequences\\\n* Full environment\\\n* Visual rhythm that tracks with audio structure (intro / build / drop / resolve)\\\n* Repeatable pipeline (you can make “another one like this” in less than a day without reinventing everything)\\\n\\\nThis proves you’re not learning anymore. You’re producing.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 5. RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\\n\\\n1. **Every session ends in a render.** If you didn’t render, your brain will lie to you about progress.\\\n2. **No feature-chasing until you hit a wall.** Don’t say “I need particles / mocap / AI faces” until you’ve maxed lighting + camera. 90% of cinematic power is lighting, framing, timing.\\\n3. **One aesthetic per render.** Do not shotgun 8 looks in one clip. Pick a mood and commit.\\\n4. **Name and archive everything.** You are building a reel and a style library whether you feel “ready” or not.\\\n5. **Never wait to feel inspired.** This is reps. You don’t get romantic in the squat rack. You just squat.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\nThis is how you get dangerous fast.\\\n\\\nYou don’t “learn Unreal.” You run daily drills in Unreal until your nervous system treats it like a camera and a light kit, not software.\\\n\\\nYou follow this doc like a training program, you come out of it with footage and control — not theory.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":10554}]"
