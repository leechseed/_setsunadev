You don’t trade all defenses for DPS.\\\n  - Mapping focus on **safe layouts**, **predictable threats**, and **repeatable routes**.\\\n  - You avoid mechanics that spike RNG death (deep delirium, rippy expedition combos) until your defenses are appropriate.\\\n  - XP loss on death is treated as an economic loss, not just “oops”.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Core Policy 3 – Tankiness Over Ego DPS\\\n\\\n- **Statement**: You will sacrifice theoretical DPS for **real-world uptime** and death avoidance.\\\n- **Implications**:\\\n  - Capped resists, spell suppression, and defenses are *non-negotiable* before big DPS spikes.\\\n  - Flask automation and defenses get bought before shiny damage jewels.\\\n  - If PoB says you lose 5% DPS to gain 20% effective HP, you take the tank.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Core Policy 4 – Automation Over APM\\\n\\\n- **Statement**: The build’s ceiling is defined by **how much you can automate**, not how fast you can mash buttons.\\\n- **Implications**:\\\n  - Charge generation is automated via Farrul’s ecosystem + gem setup, not manual generation.\\\n  - Flasks are automated with “used at full charges” and similar enchants.\\\n  - You focus on **positioning and macro decisions**, not piano mechanics.\\\n  - Any manual input that doesn’t significantly increase survival or div/hour is suspect.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Strategy Layer (How We Intend to Achieve It)\\\n\\\n### Strategy A – Phase-Based Economic Scaling\\\n\\\nBreak progression into economic phases:\\\n\\\n1. **Phase 1 – 70c → 3d**\\\n   - Objective: stabilize mapping, fix scuff gear, get a decent axe.\\\n   - Play: mid-tier maps, basic mechanics (essence, strongboxes, shrines, abyss).\\\n\\\n2. **Phase 2 – 3d → 15d**\\\n   - Objective: secure 600–700 PDPS axe, fix accuracy/crit, stabilize Flicker sustain.\\\n   - Play: T14–T16 maps, basic atlas tree tuned for consistent juice.\\\n\\\n3. **Phase 3 – 15d → 50d**\\\n   - Objective: acquire **Farrul’s Fur**, core clusters, first big flasks.\\\n   - Play: targeted currency engines (Legion / Harbinger / Abyss depending on taste).\\\n\\\n4. **Phase 4 – 50d → 120d+**\\\n   - Objective: Replica Farrul’s, insane axe, double-influenced jewelry.\\\n   - Play: fully juiced mapping or bossing as chosen; maintain high uptime with low death count.\\\n\\\n**Reasoning**:  \\\nThis prevents “I have 5 div, time to yolo a mirror-tier craft” and instead forces structured capital growth.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Strategy B – Weapon-First DPS Scaling\\\n\\\n- **Premise**: For 2H Flicker, your axe is the biggest DPS lever by a mile.\\\n- **Order of priority**:\\\n  1. **Axe PDPS** (400 → 600 → 800+)\\\n  2. **Crit consistency** (base + diamond flask + tree + jewels)\\\n  3. **Attack speed**\\\n  4. Secondary DPS sources (jewels, amulet, clusters, etc.)\\\n\\\n- **Why**:\\\n  - Every other offensive upgrade’s value scales with the raw PDPS of the weapon.\\\n  - Early currency invested into a good axe gives multiplicative returns across all other systems.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Strategy C – Charge Ecosystem for Flicker Stability\\\n\\\nFlicker Strike is worthless if you desync or de-charge.\\\n\\\n- **Goal**: Never think about charges. They just exist.\\\n- **Layers**:\\\n  - Aspect of the Cat (Farrul’s / Replica Farrul’s).\\\n  - Frenzy on hit (rings, gems, or corrupts).\\\n  - Blood Rage + Poacher’s Mark / other frenzies.\\\n  - Endurance charges from Ascendancy / Cat’s Agility interactions.\\\n\\\n**Policy**: You don’t try to “play well” to sustain Flicker; you buy/build systems so that **even bad play** doesn’t break the chain.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Strategy D – Defensive Layer Stacking\\\n\\\nFor Champion Flicker:\\\n\\\n- **Armor** → mitigates physical hits.\\\n- **Evasion** → avoids hits entirely.\\\n- **Spell Suppression** → halves spell damage.\\\n- **Block (if used)** → extra layer, but not mandatory.\\\n- **Endurance Charges** → phys reduction + ele res.\\\n- **Fortify** → flat % damage reduction.\\\n\\\n**Strategic rule**:  \\\nYou layer at least **3** of these defenses before pushing into really rippy content. Champion is chosen exactly because it stacks these easily.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Strategy E – Atlas & Content Targeting\\\n\\\n- Your atlas tree is not “whatever is fun”, it’s built around:\\\n  - **Profit density per map**.\\\n  - **Low time-to-clear per map** (Flicker loves open layouts).\\\n  - **Low mechanical complexity** (no long time-stop mechanics).\\\n\\\n- Preferred mapping:\\\n  - Open maps: **Dunes, Strand, Tropical Island, Burial, Beach, Waste Pool**.\\\n  - Mechanics with fast payoff: **Harbinger, Legion, Strongbox, Abyss, Essences**.\\\n  - Avoid early: deep Delirium, high-risk Expedition, super rippy altars if defenses are not ready.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Tactics Layer (Concrete Choices and Configurations)\\\n\\\n### Tactics: Gear by Phase\\\n\\\n#### Phase 1 (70c → 3d)\\\n\\\n- **Weapon**\\\n  - 2H Axe, 400–500 PDPS.\\\n  - Don’t obsess over perfect affixes; just get decent PDPS and crit.\\\n\\\n- **Rings**\\\n  - Must-have: **accuracy + flat phys + life + resists**.\\\n  - Optional: attack speed.\\\n\\\n- **Amulet**\\\n  - Flat phys, crit multi, attributes.\\\n  - Anoint something cheap but useful (e.g., life/attack nodes).\\\n\\\n- **Body Armour**\\\n  - Anything with life + resists that allows a decent 5L/6L.\\\n  - Bronn’s is fine early if you own it; don’t overvalue it relative to life/res.\\\n\\\n#### Phase 2 (3d → 15d)\\\n\\\n- **Weapon**\\\n  - Move to 600–700 PDPS.\\\n  - Look for T2–T1 flat + % phys and some crit/AS.\\\n\\\n- **Helmet/Gloves/Boots**\\\n  - Cap resists.\\\n  - Get spell suppression started.\\\n  - Some life and movement speed.\\\n\\\n- **Jewels**\\\n  - Simple damage + life combos.\\\n  - Attack speed with axes, multi, etc.\\\n\\\n#### Phase 3 (15d → 50d)\\\n\\\n- **Body Armour**\\\n  - Buy **Farrul’s Fur**.\\\n  - This is non-negotiable for the “real” build identity.\\\n\\\n- **Cluster Jewels**\\\n  - Large: 8-passive, with Fuel the Fight + Martial Prowess + 3rd damage notable.\\\n  - Medium: generic attack or crit clusters as needed.\\\n\\\n- **Flasks**\\\n  - Taste of Hate, Lion’s Roar, Diamond with good suffixes.\\\n\\\n#### Phase 4 (50d → 120d+)\\\n\\\n- **Body Armour**\\\n  - Upgrade to **Replica Farrul’s Fur**.\\\n\\\n- **Axe**\\\n  - 900+ PDPS, ideally influenced, with T1 phys, hybrid phys, AS, crit.\\\n\\\n- **Rings & Amulet**\\\n  - Influence combos:\\\n    - Vulnerability on hit.\\\n    - Assassin’s Mark.\\\n    - Huge crit multi and phys rolls.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Tactics: Skill Gems & Links\\\n\\\nCore 6L Flicker Strike link (example structure):\\\n\\\n- **Flicker Strike**\\\n- Multistrike\\\n- Melee Physical Damage\\\n- Rage / Brutality / Close Combat (depends on final config)\\\n- Fortify / Impale (build-dependent)\\\n- Increased Crit Damage / Nightblade / other DPS support as per PoB\\\n\\\nUtility skills:\\\n\\\n- **Blood Rage** – frenzies + attack speed.\\\n- **Ancestral Protector / Warchief** – extra damage on bosses.\\\n- **Auras** – Pride / Precision / Determination / Defiance Banner / etc. as allowed by mana.\\\n- **Movement** – Leap Slam / Dash for when Flicker is unsafe.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Tactics: Passive Tree, Ascendancy, and Clusters\\\n\\\n- **Ascendancy** (Champion):\\\n  - Fortitude → Unstoppable Hero → Conqueror → Worthy Foe / First to Strike, Last to Fall (depending on PoB).\\\n- **Tree priorities**:\\\n  - Life + life% near Marauder/Duelist.\\\n  - Axe damage and 2H cluster wheels.\\\n  - Crit chance + multi near Duelist/Ranger side.\\\n  - Spell suppression where efficient.\\\n- **Clusters**:\\\n  - Large (Attacks): Fuel the Fight + Martial Prowess + damage notable.\\\n  - Medium: Crit or area/strike if relevant.\\\n  - Small: Life or utility (res/suppression).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Tactics: Flask and Utility Setup\\\n\\\nCore flask lineup:\\\n\\\n1. **Diamond Flask**\\\n   - Suffix: crit/movespeed/curse reduction.\\\n   - Auto-use at full charges.\\\n\\\n2. **Silver Flask**\\\n   - Onslaught uptime.\\\n   - Auto-use at full charges.\\\n\\\n3. **Granite / Jade**\\\n   - For armour/evasion.\\\n   - Suffix: increased armour/evasion, reduced crit damage taken, etc.\\\n\\\n4. **Life Flask**\\\n   - Instant recovery.\\\n   - Bleed removal.\\\n\\\n5. **Unique flasks (Phase 3+)**\\\n   - Taste of Hate.\\\n   - Lion’s Roar.\\\n   - Bottled Faith (later).\\\n\\\nYou configure everything to minimize manual keypresses and maximize uptime.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Operations Layer (What You Actually Do Per Session)\\\n\\\n### Ops 1 – 70c → 3 Divines\\\n\\\n**Objective**: Stabilize the build so mapping doesn’t feel like a bar fight with a spoon.\\\n\\\n**Operational loop**:\\\n\\\n1. **Buy upgrades in this exact order**:\\\n   - 400–500 PDPS axe.\\\n   - Two rings with accuracy + flat phys + life + res.\\\n   - Amulet with any mix of phys/crit/attributes.\\\n   - Basic flasks with correct automation.\\\n\\\n2. **Run mid-tier maps (T8–T12)** with:\\\n   - Essences.\\\n   - Strongboxes.\\\n   - Shrines.\\\n   - Harbinger/Abyss when available.\\\n\\\n3. **Vendor hygiene**:\\\n   - Pick up and sell 6-socket items.\\\n   - Pick up currencies, scarabs, essences, jewels, maps.\\\n   - Filter out obvious dogshit; do not loot hoard.\\\n\\\n4. **Stop Phase 1** once:\\\n   - You have **3 divines** or equivalent in liquid + easily sold items.\\\n   - Your hit chance and resists are reasonable (close to capped).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Ops 2 – 3 Divines → 15 Divines\\\n\\\n**Objective**: Turn the build into “real Flicker”.\\\n\\\n**Operational steps**:\\\n\\\n1. **Buy 600–700 PDPS 2H Axe**.\\\n2. **Recheck PoB**:\\\n   - Hit chance → push close to 100%.\\\n   - Crit chance → 50–70% pre-flask.\\\n3. **Fix charge sustain**:\\\n   - Ensure Blood Rage is active.\\\n   - Get at least one extra source of frenzies (ring, corrupted item, etc.).\\\n4. **Mapping routine**:\\\n   - Move into T14–T16.\\\n   - Run consistent mechanics (Harbinger, Essence, Strongboxes).\\\n   - Ignore niche/slow mechanics that pause your flicker tempo.\\\n5. **Stop Phase 2** when:\\\n   - You have **15 divines**+\\\n   - Mapping feels fast and stable, few or no desyncs in charges.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Ops 3 – 15 Divines → 50 Divines\\\n\\\n**Objective**: Snap the build into its intended identity.\\\n\\\n**Operational steps**:\\\n\\\n1. **Buy Farrul’s Fur**.\\\n2. **Adjust skills / auras** to integrate Aspect of the Cat.\\\n3. **Buy large cluster jewel(s)** with correct notables.\\\n4. **Start using at least one unique flask** (Taste of Hate, Lion’s Roar).\\\n5. **Atlas**:\\\n   - Specialize into your preferred high-value mechanic (Legion/Harbinger/Abyss).\\\n   - Run the same 1–2 layouts repeatedly for muscle memory and speed.\\\n6. **Stop Phase 3** at:\\\n   - **50 divines**+\\\n   - Flicker feels “hands-off” with charges and you can ignore most micro-decisions.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Ops 4 – 50+ Divines → Top 1% State\\\n\\\n**Objective**: Convert wealth into obscene gear without bricking your sanity.\\\n\\\n**Operational steps**:\\\n\\\n1. **Upgrade armour** to Replica Farrul’s.\\\n2. **Plan the axe**:\\\n   - Either buy high-end crafted 900+ PDPS Fleshripper.\\\n   - Or buy an in-progress craft and finish with meta-mods (if you’re comfortable).\\\n\\\n3. **Upgrade jewelry**:\\\n   - Prioritize rings with on-hit curses and phys/crit.\\\n   - Upgrade amulet to heavy crit multi and phys.\\\n\\\n4. **Perfect clusters and jewels**:\\\n   - Add life and multi everywhere.\\\n   - Get specific damage mods that synergize with your final tree.\\\n\\\n5. **Shift content**:\\\n   - Mix high-juice mapping with occasional boss rotations (Shaper/Elder/Feared) to “test”.\\\n   - Stay away from dumb death content when close to 100.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Risk Management & Failure Modes\\\n\\\n### Failure Mode 1 – “I Die Too Much”\\\n\\\n- **Likely causes**:\\\n  - No suppression.\\\n  - Low life pool.\\\n  - No armour/evasion flasks.\\\n  - Brute forcing too high juice too early.\\\n\\\n- **Mitigation**:\\\n  - Temporarily downgrade map juice.\\\n  - Buy cheap defensive upgrades (suppression/res gear).\\\n  - Fix flask suffixes.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Failure Mode 2 – “Flicker Keeps Stopping”\\\n\\\n- **Likely causes**:\\\n  - Inconsistent frenzies.\\\n  - No Blood Rage uptime.\\\n  - Poor Poacher’s/Farrul’s integration.\\\n\\\n- **Mitigation**:\\\n  - Prioritize charge sources over pure DPS.\\\n  - Check if you’re overwriting Cat buffs.\\\n  - Simplify aura setup if you’re mana-starving links.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Failure Mode 3 – “I’m Broke But My Build Is Fine”\\\n\\\n- **Likely causes**:\\\n  - Running low-value mechanics.\\\n  - Looting too much trash.\\\n  - Not leveraging consistent atlas tree.\\\n\\\n- **Mitigation**:\\\n  - Refocus on 1–2 chosen mechanics.\\\n  - Tighten loot filter.\\\n  - Measure div/hour and adjust.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## KPIs and Milestones\\\n\\\n### Key Performance Indicators\\\n\\\n- **Div/hour**\\\n- **Deaths per 10 maps**\\\n- **Average map clear time**\\\n- **XP/hour at high level**\\\n\\\n### Milestones\\\n\\\n- **M1** – 3d: Functional Flicker, no scuffed white maps.\\\n- **M2** – 15d: 600–700 PDPS axe, mapping in T16.\\\n- **M3** – 30–35d: Farrul’s Fur, big clusters, stable Flicker.\\\n- **M4** – 50d+: Replica Farrul’s or near endgame armour.\\\n- **M5** – 90–100d+: endgame axe + jewelry.\\\n- **M6** – Level 95–100 with stable XP/h and low deaths.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Upgrade Order Cheat Sheet\\\n\\\n**If you are broke (≤ 1d)**:\\\n1.
