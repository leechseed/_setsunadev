## ✍️ Overview

The Concern of *The Past* defines the central area of Vivian’s personal journey—everything she experiences is haunted, corrupted, or framed by what has come before. Whether it’s her shattered memories, unresolved trauma from the MAXWING program, or the ghost data left behind in her teammates’ lobotomized bodies, Vivian’s psychological state remains tethered to a past that won’t stay buried. This section illustrates how this Concern manifests structurally and thematically in ASTRO7EX, using Dramatica theory, classical narrative frameworks, and late 2000s anime archetypes.

## 🎭 Dramatica Theory: Concern as Domain Expression

* In Dramatica, the **Concern** is the specific area of conflict within the character’s Throughline domain.
* For Main Characters situated in the **Situation** Domain, “The Past” becomes a locus of ongoing struggle—not just past events, but the burden of what has *already happened* and can’t be changed.
* Vivian doesn’t just reflect on her past; she is **stuck inside it**—a living remnant of a program that no longer exists, a war machine without a war.

## 🧠 Vivian’s Relationship to the Past

### **Narrative Triggers**

* **MAXWING Flashbacks**: Episodes of remembered training, blurred timelines, and conflicting accounts of events.
* **Residual Data in the Dead**: Vivian “sees” cybernetic echoes or corrupted techno-ghosts in the neural remnants of her former squadmates.
* **False Memory Interference**: The MODS introduce memory corruption loops, gaslighting Vivian into questioning the truth of her own survival.
* **John Smith the Eternal**: Believes the 7 “resurrected” his program—Vivian knows they were just chasing a bitcoin wallet. This contradiction is the *core* expression of distorted pasts.

### **Key Scenes**

* **The Chapel Flashback**: A hyper-religious training memory of her childhood is revealed to be a sim, with the real-world version having ended in massacre.
* **The Archive Confession**: Vivian watches footage of herself executing Penelope, then later discovers the footage was fabricated—highlighting how even documentation lies in ASTRO7EX.
* **Final Epiphany**: Vivian comes to terms not by clarifying the past, but by choosing to **let go of needing to know the truth.**

---

## 🌀 Mechanics of Revelation

* **Layered Presentation**: Truth about the past is revealed slowly, often through conflicting lenses (her own memories vs. MODS’ system logs vs. MORN propaganda).
* **Structural Function**: Each revelation about the past raises the stakes in the present; Vivian cannot take action without revisiting prior trauma.
* **Audience Experience**: The audience is placed in a *limited knowledge* position early on—experiencing flashbacks and hallucinations as Vivian does, unsure what’s real.

## 📚 Sources and Reinforcements

### **Shakespeare**

* *Hamlet* as template: the ghost of the father = the ghost of truth. Vivian, like Hamlet, questions the trustworthiness of memory, and whether knowing the truth will bring justice—or madness.

### **Robert McKee – Story**

* McKee discusses the value of the past as “emotional landmines.” Each revelation in ASTRO7EX is structured as an **explosive turn** in the emotional logic of the story, not mere exposition.

### **Keith Cunningham – The Soul of Screenplay**

* Cunningham frames backstory as *“the buried engine”* of present character behavior. Vivian’s obsessive need to uncover the truth is shown to be a *flaw,* not a path to healing.

### **Karl Iglesias – Writing for Emotional Impact**

* Iglesias emphasizes using **emotional triggers** from past trauma to bind the audience. Vivian’s inner pain is communicated through hyper-specific sensory recall: smells, sounds, phrases from her training reappear in distorted forms.

### **Late 2000s Sci-Fi Anime Archetypes**

* Vivian is modeled after characters like Gally (Alita), Yuki Nagato (*Melancholy of Haruhi*), and Motoko Kusanagi (*Ghost in the Shell*): haunted warrior girls whose memory is a prison.
* Trope Reference: “The Amnesiac Weapon”—she wasn’t made to remember. But now that she does, she can’t stop.

| **Saturn Retrograde in Scorpio**          | Past wounds, especially relating to authority and surveillance, return for karmic resolution. Vivian’s pain is from unfinished contracts—emotional and literal. |
| **Pluto 12H Transit**                     | Hidden psychological trauma reemerges violently from subconscious.                                                                                              |
| **Progressed Moon conjunct Natal Chiron** | Indicates a phase of confronting past wounds through intuition and reflection, not logic.                                                                       |

## 🎯 Summary: Cumulative Insight

Vivian’s Concern of *The Past* is more than flashbacks or origin reveals—it’s the psychic engine of ASTRO7EX. Every action she takes is filtered through her inability to reconcile what happened, to whom, and why. The plot challenges her not to *fix* the past, but to resist its gravitational pull. As the MODS manipulate records and memories, Vivian fights to maintain not her sanity—but her *moral center.* The past won’t release her. But maybe she can release it.
