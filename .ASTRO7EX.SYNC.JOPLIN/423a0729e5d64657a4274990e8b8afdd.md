16. Deep Throat Training Protocol – Gag Reflex Desensitization

# Deep Throat Training Protocol – Gag Reflex Desensitization

## Objective
Increase oral capacity, control, and endurance through progressive, daily training. Focus on reflex desensitization, neck/throat relaxation, and performance confidence.

---

## Daily Structure (10–20 min)
1. **Warm-Up (2–3 min)**
   - Tongue stretches (stick out, hold 30 sec)
   - Jaw rolls, neck circles
   - Deep breathing through nose only

2. **Desensitization (5–10 min)**
   - Use mirror
   - Start with clean fingers or small dildo
   - Touch back of tongue/throat gently
   - Repeat light contact until gag reflex reduces

3. **Deep Insertion Practice (5–7 min)**
   - Use dildo/cock trainer
   - Lube + relaxed jaw
   - Insert to first resistance, then breathe and hold
   - Pull out slowly, then reinsert a little deeper
   - Track duration of hold without gag

4. **Cooldown (2–3 min)**
   - Massage jaw and throat
   - Drink water slowly while breathing through nose
   - Optional: suck ice cube or cold water gargle

## Weekly Progression Goals
| Week | Depth Target | Hold Time Goal | Notes |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| 1    | Mid-tongue contact | 3 sec hold | Focus on relaxing gag reflex |
| 2    | Soft palate touch | 5 sec hold | Master breathing through nose |
| 3    | Near full insertion | 7 sec hold | Add light thrusting or motion |
| 4    | Full base contact | 10+ sec hold | Emphasize endurance + stillness |

## Tips for Success
- **Always breathe through nose.**
- **Relax your face, not just throat.**
- **Lube generously.**
- **Don’t rush depth – respect resistance.**
- Use **visualization or porn audio** if it helps soften resistance.

---

## Optional Enhancements
- Perform in front of mirror to reinforce visual control
- Record session for feedback or self-review
- Pair with edging session for reward conditioning

---

## Final Reminder
This is not just skill. This is **control**. The throat is a gate — you’re learning how to open it, hold it, and command it.

**Breathe. Relax. Swallow it all.**
