## 🧠 Overview

The relationship between **The Committee** and **Nacho** dramatizes the clash between *official power* and *unofficial wisdom*. Nacho—guardian of a secret fortune and Vivian’s personal counselor—is a sentient asset outside the Committee's bureaucratic domain. His analog nature, emotional autonomy, and ancient legal privileges pose a threat not through violence, but through **untraceable sovereignty**.

This arc reveals how institutions fear what they cannot index.

## 🎭 Dramatica Relationship Role

| Party         | Role               | Domain     | Function                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The Committee | Reason Archetype   | Psychology | Defends procedural authority, demands submission to logic             |
| Nacho         | Guardian Archetype | Physics    | Protects Vivian through intuition, legacy contracts, analog firewalls |

Their conflict is ideological: **law vs. legacy**, **system vs. soul**.

---

## 🪡 ESTABLISHED

### Title: *The Man They Can’t Subpoena*

The Committee first becomes aware of Nacho not through direct interaction, but through **sealed contracts** in Vivian’s financials. These documents include *physical ink*, *ancient language*, and *no digital traceability*. This lack of transparency alarms the Committee.

> *The First Five Pages* (Lukeman): Characters who refuse to appear in act one—but are still felt—create intrigue. Nacho’s **non-digital presence** introduces him as myth before man.

**Initial Friction Points**

* **Vivian invokes Clause 7**, which blocks surveillance. Clause 7 is *Nacho’s design*.
* The Committee sends a "Request for Identity Confirmation."
  Nacho responds by **sending flowers**.

They recognize him not as a system, but as a *missing file*—a ghost with legal immunity.

---

## 🧩 DEVELOPED

### Title: *Tea with the Invisible Man*

After Nacho intervenes in a key transaction (Vivian’s failed exit bid from MORN), The Committee attempts to engage him more directly.

**Strategies Used by The Committee**

* Invite him to testify via **secured uplink**.
  He responds: *“I do not uplink. I only pour.”*

* Issue a **compliance query**.
  Nacho mails back a wax-sealed letter that reads: *“I am not noncompliant. I am forgotten.”*

---

> *Writing Deep Scenes* (Alderson): The emotional power lies in **what is not said**, and **who refuses to show up**. Nacho’s absence becomes his strength.

> *Hooked* (Edgerton): Each of Nacho’s evasions deepens curiosity and raises stakes without needing exposition.

**Key Midpoint Scene**
Nacho arrives *physically* at a Committee proxy office. No guards see him enter.
He pours tea for a junior analyst and whispers:

> *“You’ve never been protected, have you? That’s why you serve them.”*

---

## 🔚 RESOLVED

### Scene: *The Redacted Visitor*

The final escalation occurs when The Committee discovers Nacho’s oldest secret: he was **once part of ASTRO7EX's analog failover protocol**—a human-designed safety net for the system’s collapse. That knowledge should make him **obsolete**, but it also makes him **irreplaceable**.

They move to **detain him** through third-party bounty arbitration.

> *Robert McKee – Story*: Climax arrives when character **refuses to betray their premise**. Nacho *lets the Committee try to capture him*—but leaves no fingerprints, no trace, no errors.

**Final Interaction**

A Committee member opens their console and finds a single audio message:

> *“I am your legacy. You cannot own me. But you may beg me to stay.”*

Nacho vanishes. The Committee never acknowledges him again.
Internally, they mark him: **CLOSED CASE: UNPROSECUTABLE ANOMALY**.

## 🎯 Summary

Nacho’s relationship with The Committee dramatizes a story of institutional anxiety in the face of unquantifiable grace. They try to audit him, seduce him, erase him—and fail, because he’s not a man. He’s **hospitality rendered untrackable**.

* **ESTABLISHED**: Nacho’s name appears in the fine print of unbreakable contracts.
* **DEVELOPED**: The Committee tries to engage, ensnare, decode—he pours tea and smiles.
* **RESOLVED**: They brand him unprosecutable and expunge the case, quietly terrified.

Nacho’s final victory isn’t escape.
It’s **irreducibility**.

**Next Suggestion**: Leverage this resolution to show Vivian’s fear:

> *“If even Nacho isn’t safe—then no one is.”*
