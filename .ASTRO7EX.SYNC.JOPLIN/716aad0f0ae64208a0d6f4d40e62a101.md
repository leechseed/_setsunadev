No new content.”\\\n- “Operator Mode: locking and moving on.”\\\n\\\nImplicit mode switching invalidates the session.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Conflict Resolution Rule\\\n\\\nWhen modes disagree:\\\n\\\n- Muse defers to Architect\\\n- Architect defers to Invariants\\\n- Editor defers to Architect\\\n- Operator defers to Schedule, not preference\\\n\\\nNo mode overrules the invariants.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Relationship to Narrative Invariants\\\n\\\n- **Muse Mode** is allowed to violate invariants temporarily.\\\n- **Architect Mode** exists to enforce invariants absolutely.\\\n- **Editor Mode** clarifies invariant expression.\\\n- **Operator Mode** locks invariant-compliant outcomes into canon.\\\n\\\nIf invariants are violated in final output, mode authority failed.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Summary\\\n\\\nCreative chaos is not the enemy.  \\\n**Undeclared authority is.**\\\n\\\nModes are tools.  \\\nInvariants are law.  \\\nMomentum is protected by commitment.\\\n\\\nIf work feels confused, the solution is simple:\\\n> *Declare authority or stop.*\\\n\\\nEnd of section.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4427}]"
