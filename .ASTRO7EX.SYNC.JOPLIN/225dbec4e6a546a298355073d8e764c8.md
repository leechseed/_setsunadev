# ESSENCE + ACTION — Character Introduction Enhancer

Strengthen character introductions by pairing **essence statements** with **an immediate action**.

---

### **Worksheet Template**
- **Main Character Essence Statement + Action:**  
  > (One-liner essence plus a defining action that shows it in motion)

- **Supporting Character Essence Statement + Action:**  
  > 

- **Antagonist Essence Statement + Action:**  
  > 

---

### **Example Snips**
- **Main Character:** *A dreamer in a leather jacket who runs on caffeine and bad decisions — now racing to fix his broken-down motorcycle with duct tape.*  
- **Supporting Character:** *A chatterbox mechanic who never met a conspiracy theory he didn’t like — handing out flyers about lizard people in the subway.*  
- **Antagonist:** *A smiling shark in a tailored suit who never raises his voice but always gets his way — sliding a contract across the table with a pen that bleeds red ink.*

### **Essence + Action Log**
| Character Role | Essence Statement + Action | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| Main           |                             |       |
| Supporting     |                             |       |
| Antagonist     |                             |       |
| Other          |                             |       |

---

### **Checklist**
- [ ] Essence is **personality-filled, one line max**.  
- [ ] Action **shows, not tells** the essence.  
- [ ] Action is **visual and immediate**.  
- [ ] Together, essence + action **set tone** and **define role quickly**.
