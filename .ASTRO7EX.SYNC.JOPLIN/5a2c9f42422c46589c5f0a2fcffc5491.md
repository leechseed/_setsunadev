## 1. Structural Theory – *The Past* as MC Concern

### **Definition**

* **The Past**: What has already happened. Events, traumas, betrayals, achievements—anything that has occurred and can no longer be changed.
* It is not memory per se; it is the *existence of the historical* that looms over the present.

### **Dramatica Placement**

* Domain: **Psychology** (internal processes—Vivian is her own battlefield)
* Type Quad:

  * **The Past** ✅
  * **The Present**
  * **The Future**
  * **Progress**

### **Dynamic Pair**

* **The Past** ↔ **The Present**: Vivian is locked in what *was*—unable to process what *is*.

### **Implication in Dramatica**

The Main Character Concern is the *personal pressure point*. Vivian’s past is *the arena of her pain, her drive, and her stuckness*. The story cannot progress until she *confronts* or *redefines* the Past—not just historically, but *symbolically*.

## 2. ASTRO7EX Expression – Vivian and Her Relationship to the Past

### 🔥 Vivian’s Past Isn’t Backstory. It’s a Battlefield.

Vivian was:

* A *legendary kingpin*, forged in child-soldier black programs like MAXWING.
* The *last survivor* of a purge ordered by the very systems she once served.
* A *ghost of the AI Collapse*—a woman whose memory of what happened is *incomplete* yet *singularly important*.

---

### ❓ What Does Vivian Want?

* **Not forgiveness**.
* **Not revenge**.
* She wants to **know what really happened**—and whether her survival *meant anything*.

---

### 🩸 Core Wounds from the Past:

* **Her crew** was lobotomized and repurposed.
* **AN7L**, the AI she helped destroy, was *not dead*—only privatized.
* **The Collapse**, which she thought she ended, *did not end*.
* She is now mythologized in propaganda—turned into a *cautionary tale* by MORN.

---

### 🪞 Symptoms of Her Obsession with the Past:

* Collects obsolete data drives, mission logs, analog recordings.
* Speaks to the ghosts of her past crewmates—*literally or psychotically*.
* Refuses to accept new allies unless they’ve *bled like she has*.
* Her safehouse is *a museum of failure*.

---

## 3. Narrative Function – Why the Past Defines Vivian's Arc

### 🎭 Main Character Throughline = *Psychological Conflict*

* Vivian is trapped in **internal feedback loops** of trauma, blame, and distorted memory.
* The Past is not a *setting*—it’s her **shackles**.

---

### 🌒 Dramatica Function

* Her MC Concern is the **Past**, but her Problem is **Aware**—she *knows* too much of the past, and cannot forget or reinterpret it.
* Her growth requires her to **remain Steadfast** but **force the world to Change**.
* She cannot rewrite the past—but she can *weaponize the truth*.

---

### 🧠 MC Throughline Actions

* Hacks ancient MODS nodes to retrieve erased logs.
* Revisits sites of massacre and collapse to *see what she missed*.
* Keeps asking the question: *“Why am I still here?”*

This is not reflection—it’s **relentless archeological warfare** against her own timeline.

---

## 4. Thematic Analysis – Bloom, McKee, Anime, Astrology

---

### **📚 Harold Bloom – The Burden of Legacy**

* Vivian lives under the weight of **misreading her own myth**.
* Her concern with *The Past* mirrors Bloom’s idea of **agon**—the anxiety of influence.
* Her “truth” is filtered through **generational propaganda**, placing her in a **heroic chain she rejects**.

> In Bloom’s terms, Vivian is an *American Prometheus*—the punished bringer of illumination.

---

### **📖 Robert McKee – Character = Pressure Over Time**

* McKee defines character not by traits but by **choices under pressure**.
* Vivian’s past *is* her pressure—she does not react to events, she reacts to her **failures**.
* ASTRO7EX externalizes this through her refusal to accept MORN’s false myth.

> The Past is Vivian’s **obstacle and compass**—it binds her, but also *orients her toward meaning*.

---

### **🎞️ 2000s Sci-Fi Anime – The Past as Poisoned Core**

* *Ergo Proxy*: The journey to understand self begins by unearthing lies.
* *Texhnolyze*: Characters attempt to build futures atop crumbling truths.
* *Lain*: History and memory intertwine until identity collapses.

Like these protagonists, Vivian’s past is not a prologue—it’s a **curse**. Her pain is structural, not sentimental.

---

### **🌌 Narrative Astrology**

#### 🪐 Natal Chart Indicators

* **South Node in Scorpio**: Past-life themes of betrayal, death, power abuse.
* **Pluto conjunct IC**: Childhood rooted in destruction; the home is a haunted weapon cache.

#### 🔁 Transits

* **Saturn return through the 12th House**: Secret systems of trauma demand reckoning.
* **Chiron return**: Past wounds re-open precisely when survival seems possible.

#### 📈 Progressions

* **Progressed Sun square natal Pluto**: The self must confront its own shadow.
* **Progressed Moon in 4th House**: Emotional pattern loops; she becomes her own mother, jailer, and savior.

Vivian’s astrology enforces her MC Concern: **The Past is her battleground, and her prison is coded in memory**.

## 5. Summary – How Vivian Illustrates “The Past” as Her Concern

Vivian’s journey in ASTRO7EX is defined by her obsession with what has already happened—not out of nostalgia, but as a matter of survival. Her past is *unfinished*, *stolen*, *misinterpreted*. It is a battleground of trauma, betrayal, and myth. The AI Collapse, the lobotomized crew, the erasure of memory and mission—none of it is stable. None of it is settled.

Her Main Character Concern is “The Past” because it is the **root of all meaning and all error** in her mind. It haunts her, misleads her, and drives her to action. Yet paradoxically, it is the only thing she trusts. She cannot move forward without *understanding* the past—but the past itself is corrupted.

Vivian’s psychology, actions, wounds, and strengths are all aligned with this Concern. As ASTRO7EX unfolds, she will not learn to let go of the Past—she will learn how to *use* it, *weaponize* it, and *unwrite the lies built atop it*.
