[Comparative Summary Table](#comparative-summary-table)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Overview**\\\nThis entry breaks down the three primary raid goals in *ARC Raiders* using the **PSTO Mental Modeling Framework**:  \\\n**Policy → Strategy → Tactics → Operations.**\\\n\\\nEach goal becomes:\\\n- **Policy:** The “why.” The underlying principle guiding decisions.  \\\n- **Strategy:** The “what.” The high-level approach.  \\\n- **Tactics:** The “how.” Mid-tier methods and patterns.  \\\n- **Operations:** The “do it now.” Concrete in-raid behaviors.\\\n\\\nThis structure allows you to quickly select a raid purpose and act decisively.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Mental Model Framework**\\\nEverything in ARC Raiders can be simplified into one guiding meta-model:\\\n\\\n## **“Plan → Prioritize → Path → Pull Out.”**\\\n\\\nFor each raid goal:\\\n- **Plan:** Choose which goal you’re pursuing.  \\\n- **Prioritize:** Focus only on actions that serve that goal.  \\\n- **Path:** Route efficiently toward that end.  \\\n- **Pull Out:** Extract safely once your quota is met.\\\n\\\nPSTO is the internal logic system for executing that model.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Goal 1 — Character Progression**\\\nXP • Skills • Quests\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Policy (1)**  \\\nProgress compounds permanently; loot does not.  \\\nEvery raid should push your **character** forward, even if material rewards are mediocre.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Strategy (1)**  \\\n- Anchor every raid around **1–2 quests**.  \\\n- Route through **high-interaction zones** (containers, ARC hotspots) for XP gains.  \\\n- **Extract early** once a key quest step is secured.  \\\n- Ensure that every raid contains at least **one irreversible gain** (XP / quest / skill).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Tactics (1)**  \\\n- Use **quest-first routing:** spawn → nearest quest node → second node → extract.  \\\n- “XP Layering”: loot containers while traveling; take opportunistic ARC fights.  \\\n- Safe-pocket quest items immediately.  \\\n- If progression stalls mid-raid → pivot to XP farming and extract.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Operations (1)**  \\\n- Open every unopened container in your path.  \\\n- Interact with ARC only when it’s safe or quest-related.  \\\n- Complete one quest step → re-check extract availability → leave.  \\\n- Avoid PvP unless unavoidable.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Goal 2 — Material Farming**\\\nComponents • Ammo • Medicine • Breakdown Parts\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Policy (2)**  \\\nConsistency > jackpot.  \\\nMaterials fuel workshop upgrades and survivability; losing them wastes time.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Strategy (2)**  \\\n- Farm **specific areas** based on material category tags (medical / industrial).  \\\n- Hunt **renewable ARC units** (Probes, Couriers, Husks).  \\\n- Use shorter, repeatable routes instead of deep risky dives.  \\\n- Leave once your material quota is met.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Tactics (2)**  \\\n- Target areas with your needed material bias.  \\\n- Strip-mine ARC enemies for alloy, fabric, chemicals, rubber.  \\\n- Avoid noise → stealth-based scavenge style.  \\\n- Manage inventory weight; prioritize stackables and high-value items.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Operations (2)**  \\\n- Enter with a short checklist: “fabric, chemicals, rubber, ammo.”  \\\n- Loot drawers, cabinets, backpacks for utility mats.  \\\n- Loot all Couriers / Probes you see.  \\\n- Extract as soon as you can craft multiple upgrades back home.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Goal 3 — Workshop Expansion**\\\nBlueprints • Weapons • Attachments\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Policy (3)**  \\\nBlueprints are the true long-term progression.  \\\nThey are rare, random, and the highest-value items in the early game.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Strategy (3)**  \\\n- Maximize **unopened container interactions per minute**.  \\\n- Focus on **dense loot interiors** instead of combat zones.  \\\n- Maintain mobility → blueprint hunting is a numbers game.  \\\n- Extract instantly when securing an unlearned blueprint.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Tactics (3)**  \\\n- Use container-dense routing: apartments, utility interiors, office clusters.  \\\n- Open **everything**—blueprints spawn universally.  \\\n- Opportunistically loot Surveyors.  \\\n- Safe-pocket blueprints instantly.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Operations (3)**  \\\n- Sprint interior-to-interior, hitting every unopened container.  \\\n- Ignore fights unless forced.  \\\n- Blueprint found → re-check extract → bounce.  \\\n- Sell duplicates to fund further runs.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Comparative Summary Table**\\\n\\\n| Goal | Policy | Strategy | Tactics | Operations |\\\n|------|--------|----------|---------|------------|\\\n| **Character Progression** | Progress > loot | Quest-anchored raids | XP layering | Do quests → extract |\\\n| **Material Farming** | Consistency > luck | Category zones | ARC strip-mining | Fill quota → extract |\\\n| **Workshop Expansion** | Blueprints > everything | Max container opens | Container sweeps | BP found → extract |\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# Looting Rules\\\n\\\nGeneral looting rules\\\n- Focus on item color.\\\n- Don't loot ammo, its cheap to craft. Collect it only when u are in need during raid and type you are currently using.\\\n- Heavier items usually are less worth per weight, so its better to collect more lighter items.\\\n- Heavier items usually give more resources when recycled than lighter.\\\n- Recycling in base is 2x better than salvaging in raid\\\n- Salvaging items for smaller parts is weight ineffective, but usefull when too much variety of items.\\\n\\\nEarly items focus\\\n\\\n    arc cells (for shield chargers)\\\n    any gun parts (preferably green)\\\n    any mechanical components (preferably green)\\\n    any electrical components (if you want to use heavier shields)\\\n    arc alloy (workbenches upgrades)\\\n\\\nWhite and green equipment require green materials.\\\nBlue equipment often require blue materials.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6373}]"
