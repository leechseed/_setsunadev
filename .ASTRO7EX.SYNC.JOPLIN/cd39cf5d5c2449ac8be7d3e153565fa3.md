[Overview](#overview)\\\n2. [Design Constraint](#design-constraint)\\\n3. [Transmission Moves (Canonical Set)](#transmission-moves)\\\n   - [1. Commit](#1-commit)\\\n   - [2.

Commit\\\n- **Function**: Convert possibility into obligation.\\\n- **Carriers**: Speech, signed action, public choice, irreversible step.\\\n- **Effect**: Narrows future options; creates residue.\\\n- **Cost Signal**: Accountability increases.\\\n- **Failure if**: The commitment can be walked back without consequence.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 2. Refuse\\\n- **Function**: Deny cooperation without proposing an alternative.\\\n- **Carriers**: Silence, withdrawal of consent, procedural noncompliance.\\\n- **Effect**: Transfers burden and risk outward.\\\n- **Cost Signal**: Pressure redirects or escalates.\\\n- **Failure if**: Refusal is treated as neutral or safe.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 3. Reveal\\\n- **Function**: Make information legible at a cost.\\\n- **Carriers**: Confession, disclosure, evidence surfaced.\\\n- **Effect**: Reconfigures leverage and threat vectors.\\\n- **Cost Signal**: Exposure creates vulnerability.\\\n- **Failure if**: Knowledge arrives without changing behavior or stakes.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 4. Delay\\\n- **Function**: Convert time into pressure.\\\n- **Carriers**: Procedural stalling, silence, conditional deferral.\\\n- **Effect**: Accumulation favors existing power.\\\n- **Cost Signal**: Options decay while waiting.\\\n- **Failure if**: Delay preserves neutrality or freezes consequences.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 5. Escalate\\\n- **Function**: Increase stakes when resolution is blocked.\\\n- **Carriers**: Expanded demands, raised consequences, widened scope.\\\n- **Effect**: Reduces exit paths; accelerates conflict.\\\n- **Cost Signal**: Loss becomes more expensive.\\\n- **Failure if**: Escalation adds noise without narrowing outcomes.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 6. Isolate\\\n- **Function**: Cut off circulation, relevance, or reach.\\\n- **Carriers**: Exclusion, blacklisting, containment, silence imposed.\\\n- **Effect**: Survival without impact.\\\n- **Cost Signal**: Agency collapses to the local.\\\n- **Failure if**: Isolation is framed as freedom or resolution.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 7. Transfer Risk\\\n- **Function**: Move danger, blame, or consequence to another party.\\\n- **Carriers**: Delegation, implication, proxy action.\\\n- **Effect**: Responsibility diffuses; outcomes persist.\\\n- **Cost Signal**: Moral residue without direct exposure.\\\n- **Failure if**: No one bears the transferred cost.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 8. Close\\\n- **Function**: Permanently foreclose options.\\\n- **Carriers**: Final decisions, burned bridges, public records.\\\n- **Effect**: Future paths collapse into fewer states.\\\n- **Cost Signal**: Irreversibility is explicit.\\\n- **Failure if**: Closure can be reopened without loss.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Usage Rules\\\n\\\n- Every **scene beat** must perform **≥1 transmission move**.\\\n- Strong scenes perform **2–3**, with one dominant.\\\n- Moves may be **quiet** (silence, delay) or **loud** (reveal, escalate).\\\n- Moves **do not guarantee success**; they only move pressure.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Integrity Checks\\\n\\\n- If dialogue performs no move → **decorative**.\\\n- If a scene ends with the same option space → **static**.\\\n- If information arrives without cost → **exposition leak**.\\\n- If emotion substitutes for a move → **Layer 3 violation**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Design Constraint\\\n\\\n> Transmission moves move **pressure**, not **justice**, not **truth**, not **hope**.\\\n\\\nThey make things harder, smaller, clearer, or more expensive—  \\\nnever easier by default.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4019}]"
