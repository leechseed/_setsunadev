each narrative scale**.\\\n\\\nIt exists to:\\\n- Prevent premature rule exposure  \\\n- Stop higher-scale logic leaking into lower-scale moments  \\\n- Provide a mechanical way to debug narrative incoherence  \\\n- Preserve invariant integrity while scaling scope  \\\n\\\nScaling answers *how far consequences spread*.  \\\nOntology answers *which truths are allowed to operate*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Core Principle: Scaling vs Ontology\\\n\\\n> **Scaling increases consequence radius.  \\\nOntology determines which constraints may speak.**\\\n\\\n- Scale is **horizontal** (reach across time, people, systems)\\\n- Ontology is **vertical** (authority of truth)\\\n\\\nScaling never introduces new ontology.  \\\nIt only **activates deeper layers of already-defined constraint**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Ontology Layer Summary\\\n\\\n| Layer | Name | Governs |\\\n|----|----|----|\\\n| **L0** | Ontological Reality | Existence, time, causality, irreversibility |\\\n| **L1** | Value & Meaning Logic | What matters, moral consequence |\\\n| **L2** | Power & Systemic Force | Who can decide, who enforces |\\\n| **L3** | Human Interface | How rules are experienced by people |\\\n| **L4** | Expression Mechanics | How pressure moves moment to moment |\\\n| **L5** | Structural Argument | How the story proves its claim |\\\n| **L6** | Delivery & Perception | How meaning is framed for the audience |\\\n\\\nLower layers constrain higher layers absolutely.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Narrative Scale Summary\\\n\\\n| Scale | Functional Unit |\\\n|----|----|\\\n| **Sentence** | Pressure |\\\n| **Beat** | Change |\\\n| **Scene** | Conflict |\\\n| **Episode** | Inquiry |\\\n| **Arc** | Transformation |\\\n| **Season** | Argument |\\\n| **World** | Permanence |\\\n\\\nEach scale widens consequence radius without changing truth.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Scale × Ontology Interaction Matrix\\\n\\\n**Legend**\\\n- ✅ = Actively enforced  \\\n- ⚠️ = Implicit / indirect  \\\n- ❌ = Must not appear  \\\n\\\n| Scale ↓ / Layer → | L0 Reality | L1 Meaning | L2 Power | L3 Interface | L4 Expression | L5 Argument | L6 Perception |\\\n|------------------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|\\\n| **Sentence** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ |\\\n| **Beat** | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |

**Sentence**\\\n**Scale Function:** Unit of pressure\\\n\\\nA sentence is the smallest vehicle by which constraint is felt.\\\n\\\n- **Active Layers:** L3, L4 (L6 indirectly)\\\n- **Must Do:** transmit intent, risk, leverage, tone\\\n- **Must Not:** explain the world, state theme, resolve conflict\\\n\\\n**Diagnostic:**  \\\n> If the sentence can be removed without changing pressure, it failed its scale.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Beat**\\\n**Scale Function:** Unit of change\\\n\\\nA beat marks a before/after difference in understanding or intent.\\\n\\\n- **Active Layers:** L3, L4 (L1 implicitly)\\\n- **Must Do:** force adjustment, alter momentum\\\n- **Must Not:** stall motion, reset state, add rules\\\n\\\n**Diagnostic:**  \\\n> If nothing is different afterward, the beat does not exist.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Scene**\\\n**Scale Function:** Unit of conflict\\\n\\\nA scene is a closed system of opposition with cost.\\\n\\\n- **Active Layers:** L2, L3, L4 (L1 pressured)\\\n- **Must Do:** pit incompatible goals, extract payment\\\n- **Must Not:** introduce world logic, end cleanly\\\n\\\n**Diagnostic:**  \\\n> If no one paid something, the scene was decorative.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Episode**\\\n**Scale Function:** Unit of inquiry\\\n\\\nAn episode pressures one belief or assumption across scenes.\\\n\\\n- **Active Layers:** L1, L2, L3, L4 (L5 implicit)\\\n- **Must Do:** reveal patterns, propagate consequence\\\n- **Must Not:** reset status quo, deliver final judgment\\\n\\\n**Diagnostic:**  \\\n> If you can’t name the belief being tested, it’s filler.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Arc**\\\n**Scale Function:** Unit of transformation\\\n\\\nAn arc tracks irreversible change over time.\\\n\\\n- **Active Layers:** L1, L2, L3, L5\\\n- **Must Do:** close options, deform identity or systems\\\n- **Must Not:** allow cost-free growth, undo damage\\\n\\\n**Diagnostic:**  \\\n> If everything is still possible at the end, no arc occurred.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Season**\\\n**Scale Function:** Unit of argument\\\n\\\nA season argues how the world actually works.\\\n\\\n- **Active Layers:** L0, L1, L2, L5\\\n- **Must Do:** stress-test a claim, clarify what wins\\\n- **Must Not:** change rules, rely on character exceptions\\\n\\\n**Diagnostic:**  \\\n> If the season can’t be summarized as an argument, it drifted.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **World**\\\n**Scale Function:** Unit of permanence\\\n\\\nThe world encodes truth independent of story presence.\\\n\\\n- **Active Layers:** All (dominated by L0 and L2)\\\n- **Must Do:** accumulate history, enforce systems without heroes\\\n- **Must Not:** bend rules, forget consequence\\\n\\\n**Diagnostic:**  \\\n> If rules fail when characters exit, it’s a stage—not a world.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Rules of Interaction\\\n\\\n1. Lower layers constrain higher layers  \\\n2. Higher layers express, never override  \\\n3. Scaling widens reach; it never invents truth  \\\n4. Violations propagate upward and destabilize coherence  \\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Scale–Ontology Violations\\\n\\\n- Theme stated in dialogue → L1 leaked into Sentence  \\\n- Hero fixes system → L3 overrode L2  \\\n- Lore dump mid-scene → L0 injected too early  \\\n- Reset episode → L5 ignored  \\\n- Retcon ending → L0 violated  \\\n\\\nMost narrative failures reduce to one of these.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Practical Usage\\\n\\\n### Drafting\\\n- Identify current scale\\\n- Restrict yourself to allowed layers\\\n- Treat forbidden layers as off-limits\\\n\\\n### Revision\\\n- When something feels wrong, locate the scale\\\n- Identify the layer intrusion\\\n- Remove, defer, or relocate the violating element\\\n\\\n### Design\\\n- Lock ontology first\\\n- Design scaling second\\\n- Let characters express, never define\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Final Compression Rule\\\n\\\n> **Scale decides how far meaning travels.  \\\nOntology decides how much truth is allowed to speak.**\\\n\\\nLock both, and narrative coherence survives indefinitely.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":7068}]"
