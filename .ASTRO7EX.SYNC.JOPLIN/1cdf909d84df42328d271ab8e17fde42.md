MCDP 3 — Expeditionary Operations (Knowledgebase Summary)

# MCDP 3 — Expeditionary Operations (Knowledgebase Summary)

## Abstract
MCDP 3, *Expeditionary Operations*, establishes the doctrinal foundation for the Marine Corps as a naval expeditionary force-in-readiness operating in a complex, chaotic, and uncertain global environment. It argues that U.S. national interests increasingly require rapid, flexible military responses in the world’s littoral regions, often under austere conditions and short notice. The publication defines expeditionary operations, explains why and how they are conducted, and describes the organizations and concepts that enable them. It demands a distinct expeditionary mindset, naval character, operational competence, and adaptability to project and sustain combat power overseas in support of national objectives.

## TL;DR
- The post–Cold War environment is characterized by disorder, instability, and frequent crisis.
- Most future crises will occur in the littorals of the developing world.
- Expeditionary operations project military power into foreign settings to achieve specific objectives.
- Expeditionary forces must be rapid, flexible, adaptable, and sustainable.
- The Marine Corps is organized, trained, and equipped specifically for expeditionary operations.
- Naval character enables global reach, mobility, and forcible entry.
- Expeditionary operations require a distinct mindset emphasizing readiness and austerity.
- Operational maneuver from the sea underpins Marine Corps expeditionary concepts.
- Versatility and adaptability are essential in uncertain and changing conditions.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### Foreword / Preface
- Marine Corps forces are a naval expeditionary force-in-readiness.
- Expeditionary capabilities are central to national military strategy.
- Versatility and adaptability are essential in an uncertain world.

### Chapter 1 — The Landscape: Chaos in the Littorals
This chapter describes the global environment that drives the need for expeditionary operations.

#### After the Cold War: The New Anarchy
- Bipolar stability has given way to fragmented, multipolar instability.
- Conflict is more frequent, diverse, and unpredictable.
- Asymmetrical threats are increasingly common.

#### Crises: Disaster, Disruption, Dispute
- Crises fall into disasters, disruptions, and disputes.
- Many crises threaten U.S. interests without involving major war.
- Military force may be required across a wide spectrum.

#### Fragmentation and Integration
- Political fragmentation increases instability.
- Economic integration increases global interdependence.
- Local events can have global consequences.

#### Major Regional Contingency
- Large-scale conflict remains possible and dangerous.
- Regional powers may challenge U.S. interests.
- Forward forces must be prepared for high-intensity conflict.

#### Smaller-Scale Contingencies
- Smaller crises are more frequent than major wars.
- Operations often involve irregular or hybrid threats.
- Military operations other than war are common.

#### Nonstate Actors
- Nonstate groups increasingly wield organized violence.
- Such actors employ asymmetrical methods.
- Accountability and deterrence are more difficult.

#### The Developing World
- Instability is concentrated in developing regions.
- Weak infrastructure complicates military operations.
- Humanitarian crises are common.

#### Urbanized Terrain
- Urban areas are increasingly likely battlefields.
- Urban terrain favors defenders and small-unit actions.
- Civilian presence complicates operations.

#### The Importance of the Sea and the Littoral Regions
- Global trade and population concentrate near the sea.
