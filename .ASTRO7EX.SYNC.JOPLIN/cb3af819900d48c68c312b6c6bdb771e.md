Let the humor add the color.  \\\n\\\n2. **Thriller**  \\\n   Work down the page, building suspense moment by moment.  \\\n\\\n3. **Horror**  \\\n   Try out some poetry in your most horrific moments. It’ll make your scenes even creepier.  \\\n\\\n4. **Sci-Fi**  \\\n   Work in descriptions of futuristic devices and new rules as they actually impact the story.  \\\n\\\n5. **Period Piece**  \\\n   Point to the emotional undercurrent in your scenes with loaded looks and whispered moments.  \\\n\\\n6. **Superhero**  \\\n   Give your scenes comic-book color by punctuating sounds and action moments.  \\\n\\\n7. **Romance**  \\\n   Work emotion into action.
