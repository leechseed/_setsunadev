26 MC Signpost 3

As we enter Act 3, Vivian's internal focus shifts fully toward The Future. This is no longer about the past she’s escaped or the memories she’s tried to decode. Now, every action is driven by what might happen. Vivian's character is dominated by projections—prophecies, countdowns, AI simulations, and moral reckonings. She is no longer merely reacting to trauma or resisting a corrupted world; she is confronting the terminal shape of her story and what future she is willing to allow.

Her obsession with The Future is both visionary and delusional. The coming arc is defined by her attempts to author the outcome of not just her own journey, but of what meaning will survive this collapsing system
