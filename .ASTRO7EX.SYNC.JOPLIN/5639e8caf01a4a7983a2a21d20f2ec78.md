## 1. Overview

This report documents the finalized **Main Character Choices** for Vivian in the Dramatica systemâ€™s **Storyforming phase**. These decisions define the foundation of her emotional and thematic role in ASTRO7EX and determine how her internal arc will resonate with the audience, opposition, and narrative design.

---

## 2. Main Character Resolve

- **âœ… Choice:** **Steadfast**

> Vivian does **not** change her worldview.  
> She endures, resists, and holds to her personal truth in the face of overwhelming opposition.

**Astrological Justification:**
- â˜¿ Mercury in Scorpio + â™„ Saturn in Capricorn â†’ Deep internal certainty and resistance to external change.
- ðŸŒ™ Pisces Moon â†’ Vulnerable emotional core protected by endurance mechanisms.

**Narrative Insight:**  
Vivian is the fixed point around which the story spins. The world pushes her to break; she does not.

---

## 3. Main Character Growth Direction

- **âœ… Choice:** Holding out for something to **Stop**

> Vivian waits for something externalâ€”systemic, oppressive, falseâ€”to **end**.  
> Her journey is defined by resistance, not pursuit.

**Astrological Justification:**
- â™‡ Pluto themes dominate her emotional logic: she waits for the machine to die before she can live.
- Internal patterning implies suppression, not desire.

**Narrative Insight:**  
Vivian is not waiting for hope. She is enduring the end of a cycleâ€”of memory, prophecy, controlâ€”and she refuses to move until it breaks.

---

## 4. Main Character Approach

- **âœ… Choice:** **Do-er**

> Vivian responds to personal problems by **acting externally**â€”sabotage, theft, resistance, disruption.

**Astrological Justification:**
- â™‚ Aries Mars â†’ Externalized survival instinct.
- â†‘ Gemini Rising â†’ Kinetic, fast-twitch, reactive behavior patterns.
- â˜¿ Scorpio Mercury â†’ Her thoughts donâ€™t stay thoughtsâ€”they become actions.

**Narrative Insight:**  
Even her numbness is kinetic. Sheâ€™s always *doing something*, even if itâ€™s destruction.

---

## 5. Main Character Problem-Solving Style

- **âœ… Choice:** **Intuitive**

> Vivian processes the world through **relational, symbolic, and emotional pattern recognition** rather than step-by-step logic.

**Astrological Justification:**
- ðŸŒ™ Pisces Moon + â˜¿ Scorpio Mercury â†’ Subconscious pattern-reading, emotionally driven cognition.
- â˜‰ Libra Sun â†’ Weighs harmony, not data.
- â™„ Saturn in Capricorn â†’ Internal coherence, not external proof.

**Narrative Insight:**  
She doesn't analyzeâ€”she *senses*. Her moves are poetic, emotional, and deeply nonlinear.
