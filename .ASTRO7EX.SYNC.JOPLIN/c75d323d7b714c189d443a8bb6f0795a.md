# Park Glute Program (No Machines) — Glute Lab–Style

## What you need (pick your load options)
**Bring 1–2 of these in your car:**
- **Adjustable dumbbells** OR **kettlebell**
- **Long loop band** + **mini band**
- **Backpack** you can load (plates/books/water jugs)
- **Yoga mat** (thrusts/bridges/floor work)
- Optional: **hip thrust pad** / towel

**Park “equipment” you’ll use:**
- Bench / picnic table / low wall (for hip thrusts, split squats, step-ups)

---

## Weekly schedule (simple)
- **Day A (Heavy Thrust + Squat pattern)**
- **Day B (Hinge + Unilateral)**
- **Day C (Pump + Abduction + Conditioning-ish)**

**Session length:** 35–55 min

---

## Warm-up (5–8 min, every day)
1–2 rounds:
- **Banded lateral walk**: 10–15 steps each way
- **Glute bridge iso-hold**: 20–30 sec
- **Frog pumps**: 15–25
- **Hip hinge patterning** (bodyweight good-morning): 10 reps

---

## Day A — “Heavy” Thrust + Squat Pattern
### 1) Hip Thrust (bench/table)
Choose one:
- **DB/KB Hip Thrust**: 4 x 6–12
- **Backpack Hip Thrust**: 4 x 10–20
**Rules:** 2-sec squeeze at the top, full lockout, no bouncing. Rest 90–150 sec.

### 2) Bulgarian Split Squat (rear foot on bench)
- 3 x 8–12 / leg  
**Glute bias:** slight forward torso, drive through midfoot/heel. Rest 90–120 sec.

### 3) Step-Ups (high step if safe)
- 3 x 8–12 / leg  
Hold DBs or wear loaded backpack.

### 4) Band Abductions (mini band above knees)
Pick one:
- **Standing abduction**: 2–3 x 20–30 / side
- **Lateral walk burnout**: 2 rounds of 15–20 steps each way

### 5) Finisher (optional)
- **Frog pumps**: 2 x 25–40

---

## Day B — Hinge + Unilateral (glute stretch day)
### 1) Romanian Deadlift (DB/KB/backpack)
- 4 x 6–12  
**Rules:** hips back, soft knees, keep the weight close, stretch in glutes/hamstrings. Rest 2 min.

### 2) Single-Leg RDL (DB/KB)
- 3 x 8–12 / leg  
Go slow. Balance matters more than weight.

### 3) Reverse Lunge (glute friendly)
- 3 x 10–15 / leg  
DBs or backpack. Rest 90 sec.

### 4) B-stance Hip Thrust (one foot slightly forward)
- 3 x 10–15 / side  
2-sec squeeze at top.

### 5) Band Kickbacks (anchor band around bench leg if possible)
- 2–3 x 15–25 / side  
If you can’t anchor: do **quadruped kickbacks** with a mini band.

---

## Day C — Pump + Upper-Glute + “work capacity”
### 1) Hip Thrust (lighter, high reps)
- 3 x 12–25  
Shorter rest: 60–90 sec.

### 2) Walking Lunges (or stationary if space sucks)
- 3 x 20–40 total steps  
Add DBs/backpack if you can keep form.

### 3) 45° “Park Hamstring/Glute” Substitute
Pick one:
- **Single-leg hip hinge good-morning** (bodyweight or backpack): 3 x 12–20
- **Bench-supported back extension substitute** (hands on bench, hinge pattern): 3 x 15–25
(If this feels sketchy, skip it—don’t be a hero.)

### 4) Abduction Giant Set (no rest)
- **Lateral walks**: 15–20 steps each way
- **Side-lying abduction**: 15–25 / side
- **Frog pumps**: 20–40  
Do 2–3 rounds.

---

## Progression (how you get bigger glutes without machines)
Use this rule for each main move (thrust, split squat, RDL):
- Stay in the rep range.
- When you hit the **top reps on all sets**, make it harder next time by ONE of:
  - Add weight (DBs/backpack)
  - Add reps
  - Add a set (max +1 set per exercise)
  - Add tempo: **3 sec down**
  - Add a pause: **2 sec at stretch** (bottom of split squat/RDL) or **2 sec at lockout** (thrust)

**If you’re stuck with light weights:** use unilateral + tempo + pauses + high reps. That works.

---

## “Tell it like it is” form priorities
- **Hip thrusts:** if you’re not fully locking out and squeezing, you’re wasting sets.
- **Split squats/lunges:** control the bottom. If knees hate it, shorten range and do reverse lunges/step-ups.
- **RDLs:** if you feel it in low back more than glutes/hamstrings, lighten the load and hinge correctly.

---

## Packing list (so you actually do it)
- DBs/KB or backpack + load
- 2 bands (mini + long)
- mat + towel (thrust pad)
- water + timer (phone)

---

## Optional: 2-day version (if you want it simpler)
**Day 1:** Day A  
**Day 2:** Day B  
Add Day C stuff as a 10-min finisher twice/week (abduction giant set).
