No lore flexing.\\\n\\\n**Your task**:\\\nConfirm:\\\n\\\n* Single POV character (name or placeholder)\\\n* The system / authority they collide with\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## STEP 4 — Scene Skeleton (Layer 4–First)\\\n\\\nWe outline scenes *only* by **Expression Mechanics**.\\\n\\\nExample structure (illustrative only):\\\n\\\n| Scene | Dominant Layer 4 Move | What Changes                     |\\\n| ----- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |\\\n| 1     | Commit                | Character binds themselves       |\\\n| 2     | Refuse                | System reroutes pressure         |\\\n| 3     | Reveal                | Exposure increases vulnerability |\\\n| 4     | Isolate               | Impact collapses to local        |\\\n| 5     | Close                 | Exit path permanently ends       |\\\n\\\nThis prevents decorative scenes.\\\n\\\n**Your task**:\\\nApprove a **4–5 scene count** for the pilot.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## STEP 5 — Bind Layer 3 (Human Interface)\\\n\\\nFor each scene, pick **one dominant experience** only:\\\n\\\n* Compression\\\n* Ritualization\\\n* Defiance without expectation\\\n* Dissociation\\\n* Stubborn continuity\\\n* etc.\\\n\\\nNo emotional smearing.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## STEP 6 — Validate the Argument (Layer 5)\\\n\\\nAt the end, ask:\\\n\\\n> If the protagonist failed completely, would the claim still be true?\\\n\\\nIf yes → valid pilot\\\nIf no → rewrite, not rethink\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## WHAT WE DO NEXT (Concrete)\\\n\\\nIf you reply with the following **four answers**, I will generate the full pilot outline cleanly:\\\n\\\n1. **Layer 5 claim** the pilot proves\\\n2. **Layer 6 terminal state**\\\n3. **POV character** + **system they collide with**\\\n4. **Scene count** (4 or 5)\\\n\\\nNo prose yet.\\\nNo dialogue yet.\\\nJust the **structural pilot blueprint**.\\\n\\\nYou’re officially out of theory land now.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3102}]"
