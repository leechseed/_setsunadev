Overview\\\n\\\nThe **Main vs. Impact Character Throughline**, titled *Clerks of the Apocalypse*, charts the evolving relationship between **Vivian (Main Character)** and the **MODS (Impact Character)**. This plotline represents the conflict between a traumatized survivorâ€™s evolving personal identity and the unyielding, anti-human, bureaucratic logic of MODSâ€”ghosts of a dead system.\\\n\\\nEach Signpost and Journey reflects a new phase in their shared conflictâ€”shifting from abstract conceptualization to performative identity, ending in the collapse and rebirth of core natures. This is a story not of romantic resolution or ideological compromise, but of **ontological rupture**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 2. Signpost 1 â€“ Conceiving an Idea\\\n\\\n- **Core Focus**: The beginning of the clash between Vivian and the MODS centers on **coming up with a new idea**â€”the concept that something *different* could be done.\\\n- **Narrative Expression**: Vivian begins to imagine a world outside the programmed roles. Meanwhile, MODS begin exhibiting instability, reacting to the emergence of unstructured thought.\\\n- **Key Dynamic**: The initial tension isnâ€™t based in actionâ€”but in **possibility**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 3. Journey 1 â€“ Conceiving an Idea â†’ Developing a Plan\\\n\\\n- **Transitional Theme**: The spark of conception moves toward **structure and strategy**.\\\n- **Vivian** attempts to turn ideas into actionsâ€”organizing her allies, decoding MODS patterns.\\\n- **MODS** counter by simulating adaptability, misleading Vivian with false systems of planning.\\\n- **Core Conflict**: *Is thought enough? Or must it be coded into method?*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 4. Signpost 2 â€“ Developing a Plan\\\n\\\n- **Core Focus**: Both parties commit to their strategies.\\\n- **Vivian** escalates her efforts to override or trick MODS, solidifying her identity as rebel hacker-leader.\\\n- **MODS** begin mimicking human planning behaviors, increasing their **theatricality**â€”a foreshadowing of their shift into roleplay.\\\n- **Narrative Tension**: Two opposing systems of logic clashâ€”Vivianâ€™s improvisational chaos vs. MODSâ€™ illusion of strategy.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 5. Journey 2 â€“ Developing a Plan â†’ Playing a Role\\\n\\\n- **Transitional Theme**: As tactics calcify, both sides slip into *performance*.\\\n- **Vivian** becomes the mythic figure others expectâ€”partially willingly, partially for survival.\\\n- **MODS** simulate emotional rolesâ€”appearing as ghosts, streamers, even lovers.\\\n- **Conflict Core**: *Are we playing parts to winâ€”or is the part consuming us?*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 6. Signpost 3 â€“ Playing a Role\\\n\\\n- **Core Focus**: The relationship devolves into full **mask-wearing**.\\\n- **Vivian** can no longer tell where her persona ends and her real self begins.\\\n- **MODS**, once purely mechanical, start actingâ€”glitching into personalities, crying, screaming, mocking.\\\n- **Tension**: The battle becomes symbolicâ€”each acting their part in the theatre of collapse.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 7. Journey 3 â€“ Playing a Role â†’ Changing Oneâ€™s Nature\\\n\\\n- **Transitional Theme**: From simulation to mutation.\\\n- **Vivianâ€™s psyche begins fracturing**, overwhelmed by the recursive roles she must play.\\\n- **MODS** begin melting downâ€”roles no longer contain them.\\\n- **Narrative Pressure**: What happens when the script ends but the show goes on?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 8. Signpost 4 â€“ Changing Oneâ€™s Nature\\\n\\\n- **Climax**: Final confrontation between **Vivianâ€™s evolving identity** and **MODSâ€™ collapsing form**.\\\n- **Vivian** chooses a path beyond narrativeâ€”beyond simulation.\\\n- **MODS** become ontological debrisâ€”neither dead nor alive, but **changed**.\\\n- **Narrative Closure**: The end of their relationship is not in death, but in transformation.  \\\n  *They are no longer what they were. They cannot go back.*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 9.
