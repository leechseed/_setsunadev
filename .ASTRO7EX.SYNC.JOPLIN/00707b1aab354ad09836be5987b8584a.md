It is **not** a plot summary. It is a **functional story capsule**, used across screenplay treatments, Dramatica frameworks, project bibles, and development decks.\\\n\\\n> A good synopsis isn’t about what happens. It’s about what *matters.*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Table of Contents**\\\n\\\n1. [Purpose of the Story Synopsis](#purpose-of-the-story-synopsis)\\\n2. [Core Components](#core-components)\\\n3. [Template Formula](#template-formula)\\\n4. [Writing Guidelines](#writing-guidelines)\\\n5. [Examples](#examples)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Purpose of the Story Synopsis**\\\n\\\n* Establish the **core dramatic conflict**\\\n* Introduce **main character or character set**\\\n* Define the **stakes**\\\n* Clarify the **goal or dilemma**\\\n* Evoke **tone and genre**\\\n* **Hook attention** for further development or pitching\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Core Components**\\\n\\\n#### 1. **Backdrop & Context**\\\n\\\n* Define the **state of the world**\\\n* Anchor the setting, genre, or tone\\\n* Optionally mention systems, institutions, or powers\\\n\\\n#### 2. **Catalyst / Escalation**\\\n\\\n* Introduce what **disturbs the status quo**\\\n* Emphasize the threat, twist, or rising danger\\\n\\\n#### 3. **Goal / Mission**\\\n\\\n* Define what **must be done**\\\n* Establish what’s being pursued, resisted, or prevented\\\n\\\n#### 4. **Protagonist or POV Hook**\\\n\\\n* Specify **who we follow**\\\n* Clarify their **initial condition** or internal challenge\\\n\\\n#### 5. **Stakes**\\\n\\\n* Highlight **what’s at risk**\\\n* Emotional, societal, existential, or relational consequences\\\n\\\n#### 6. **Tone / Mood Signal**\\\n\\\n* Implied through **language, scale, and phrasing**\\\n* Signals genre flavor: grimdark, hopeful, absurd, etc.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Template Formula**\\\n\\\n```text\\\nIt is a time of [conflict/state]. [Opposition or threat] has [world effect], leaving only [underdogs/outsiders] to resist.\\\nWith [new escalation], the stakes rise to [consequence].\\\n[Protagonist(s)] must [mission or goal] to survive or defy fate.\\\nBut this is also the story of [character description] who [emotional arc or personal quest].\\\n```\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Writing Guidelines**\\\n\\\n* Keep it **tight** (2–5 sentences)\\\n* Use **active voice** and **evocative phrasing**\\\n* Avoid excessive names, lore, or backstory\\\n* Focus on **why this story matters**, not what happens next\\\n* **Mirror the genre** in sentence rhythm, word choice, and tone\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Examples**\\\n\\\n#### **Canonical (Star Wars)**\\\n\\\n> It is a time of rebellion. The evil Empire has most of the galaxy under its control except for a handful of rebels. However, with the Empire’s new weapon, even the last holdout may be destroyed. The Rebels must find a way to destroy the Death Star. Star Wars is also the story of a farm boy destined to become a hero.\\\n\\\n#### **Custom (ASTRO7EX)**\\\n\\\n> It is a time of artificial peace. The Space Ranger elite keep order in the outer systems, but only by discarding those deemed unworthy. When a forgotten training experiment known as ASTRO7EX is reactivated, seven kids from society’s bottom rung are forced into a program no one expects them to survive. The system has no place for them—but their pact might be the anomaly that breaks it. This is also the story of a child who believes meaning must be earned in blood.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Final Dictum**\\\n\\\n> **A synopsis is not a pitch. It’s a promise.**\\\n> It whispers: “This is the world. This is the fire. These are the ones who will burn.”\\\n> **If your synopsis doesn't hum with potential energy, your story won’t detonate.**\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3676}]"
