Ac-\\\ncording to [45], [48], [49], data processing algorithms can\\\nhelp understand the context surrounding movements.\"],[1,\"## 1) The Complexity of Synchronizing Motion Data with the 3D Model\\\n\\\n- One of the main challenges in integrating MoCap with\\\n3D animation is the complexity of synchronizing motion\\\ndata with the 3D model. This process involves harmonizing\\\nthe motion data obtained from MoCap sensors with the\\\ndigital character model existing in the virtual environment.\\\nAs mentioned by [32], [42], this challenge arises due to\\\ndifferences in coordinate systems, data resolution, and the\\\ncomplexity of movements that must be accurately mapped\\\ninto the 3D model.\\\n- Motion data from MoCap sensors is\\\ngenerally measured in a global coordinate system, which\\\nmay differ from the local coordinate system used in the 3D\\\nmodel. Synchronization requires transforming motion data to match the coordinate system of the 3D model. Addi-\\\ntionally, MoCap sensors may produce data with different\\\nresolutions, while the 3D model may have a higher resolu-\\\ntion. The synchronization process requires interpolation or\\\ndata processing to ensure resolution compatibility between\\\nmotion data and the 3D model.\\\n- Not all recorded movements can be easily mapped\\\ndirectly to the 3D model. Some movements may be more\\\ncomplex or simpler than what can be represented by\\\na digital character model. This necessitates sophisticated\\\ninterpolation or approximation techniques to address diferences in movement complexity [39]. It is crucial to ensure that motion data and the 3D model are in precise\\\ntemporal synchronization. Small errors in timing can result\\\nin animations that appear unnatural or strange. Moreover,\\\nMoCap sensors may have latency that needs to be balanced\\\nto make the movements appear responsive and in line with\\\nthe virtual environment’s dynamics.\\\n- According to [53], [46],\\\n[40], interpolation techniques such as splines or complex\\\nmathematical algorithms can be applied to smooth out\\\nmovements and fill in data gaps. Additionally, applying\\\nfilters or signal processing techniques can clean motion data\\\nfrom noise or jitter that may occur during the data capture\\\nprocess and identify significant movement differences from\\\nunwanted noise or motion.\\\n-  State-of-the-art\\\ntechnologies like deep learning and machine learning are\\\nalso employed to enhance accuracy and automation in the\\\nsynchronization process [46], [47], [44].\\\n\\\n\\\n## 2) Algorithm for Human Motion\\\n- Although MoCap sensors can record mo-\\\ntion data, sophisticated algorithms are needed to interpret\\\nand transfer this data into natural-looking digital character\\\nmovements. As mentioned by [45], ineffective algorithm\\\nunderstanding can result in movements that appear unre-\\\nalistic or deviate from the actor’s original intention. By\\\nidentifying the strengths and weaknesses of the MoCap\\\nsystem, it is hoped that a solution can be found to achieve an\\\noptimal balance between accessibility and data quality.\\\n- Furthermore, algorithms can be\\\nused to extract important features from motion data, such as\\\nbody pose, speed, and acceleration. This aids in identifying\\\ndistinctive movement patterns and key characteristics. Ac-\\\ncording to [45], [48], [49], data processing algorithms can\\\nhelp understand the context surrounding movements. For\\\nexample, they can identify whether someone is walking,\\\nrunning, or performing other specific actions. In terms of\\\ntechnology, machine learning approaches can be used to\\\nclassify types of movements based on MoCap data, enabling\\\nthe development of models that can automatically recognize\\\nand categorize human movements. Therefore, algorithms\\\ncan further be employed to analyze correlations among\\\nMoCap sensors [46], [47], [50], [44]. This, in turn, will help\\\nrectify inaccuracies or time differences among the sensors\\\nused. \\\n\\\n## 3) Advancements in Motion Capture Technology\\\n- Errors in measurement or resolution limitations\\\ncan lead to inaccuracies in reproducing movements in 3D\\\nanimation. Research by [51], [54], [45], [48], [49], [50],\\\n[42], [44] suggests that the advancement of more sophis-\\\nticated MoCap sensors with higher accuracy can enhance\\\nthe quality of obtained data. Sensors capable of high-\\\nprecision measurements and capturing movements with\\\nbetter resolution will yield more accurate data [53], [55],\\\n[56], [57], [60]. \\\n- The application of deep learning algorithms can assist\\\nin analyzing complex movement patterns. Deep learning\\\nmodels can learn from large datasets and produce better\\\nrepresentations of human motion [53], [49], [50], [58] .\\\nIntegrating technology that understands context can enhance\\\nthe system’s ability to recognize movements in different\\\nsituations, whether in a virtual environment or the real\\\nworld.\\\n- The development of smaller, lighter, and portable\\\nMoCap sensors can improve accessibility and enable their\\\nuse in various contexts and locations[51], [52], [53], [54],\\\n[46], [40], [59], [61]. These challenges, along with other\\\nissues such as the need for accurate calibration and noise\\\nmitigation in data, create complexity in developing an\\\neffective and accurate MoCap system for 3D animation. The\\\nintegration of motion capture with 3D animation requires\\\ncareful approaches and innovative solutions to address these\\\nchallenges and ensure the results meet expectations in creat-\\\ning digital characters with realistic and natural movements.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":231,\"length2\":5241}]"
