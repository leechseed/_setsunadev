they’re a walking focal point even when still.\\\n* **Narrative:** Shots and descriptions linger on their presence; any frame they’re in becomes about them.\\\n\\\n### **Kinetic lust**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Their sexuality is in how they move—walking, stretching, turning, breathing.\\\n* **Narrative:** Motion shots (walk cycles, transitions) become the primary goon bait rather than static poses.\\\n\\\n### **Objectification architecture**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Their body feels built to be looked at, used, posed, or displayed like an object.\\\n* **Narrative:** Framing treats them as an altar, trophy, or toy; scenes lean into angles that dehumanize on purpose.\\\n\\\n### **Worship trigger**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** They radiate “untouchable” or “divine” energy that demands reverence, not casual lust.\\\n* **Narrative:** Scenes stage them like a shrine—slow reveals, low angles, ritualized lighting, devotional language.\\\n\\\n### **Corruption/temptation drive**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Their whole appeal is “I shouldn’t, but I want to”—forbidden, dangerous, or morally off-limits.\\\n* **Narrative:** They show up at moral crossroads; their presence escalates bad decisions and plot sin.\\\n\\\n### **Domination attention-lock**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** They feel in control; their sex appeal is power and threat, not softness.\\\n* **Narrative:** Scenes with them tilt power dynamics; others react, flinch, or submit without realizing it.\\\n\\\n### **Innocence dissonance**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** They look harmless or pure while radiating something quietly ruinous underneath.\\\n* **Narrative:** The camera or prose plays the gap between “she looks sweet” and “this is lethal goon bait.”\\\n\\\n### **Breeding instinct ignition**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Their proportions and demeanor spike primal, reproductive impulses—hips, softness, warmth.\\\n* **Narrative:** Framing leans into fertility coding—hips, lower belly, pelvis angles, “future” subtext.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 4. **Body Silhouette**\\\n\\\n### **Deadly hourglass**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Extreme waist-to-hip and bust contrast; sharp, exaggerated curves.\\\n* **Narrative:** Silhouette reads as weaponized femininity; profile shots and tight clothing do heavy lifting.\\\n\\\n### **Slimthick predator**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Lean upper frame with dense thighs/ass; athletic but soft in the right places.\\\n* **Narrative:** Emphasis on contrast—shots that track from narrow waist/torso down into heavy lower body.\\\n\\\n### **Bubble-hips cutie**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Round, high hips and ass; overall compact and bouncy.\\\n* **Narrative:** Chibi/“shortstack” energy; low-angle framing and walking animations focus on hip sway.\\\n\\\n### **Long-legs runway menace**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Legs dominate the proportions; torso feels smaller by comparison.\\\n* **Narrative:** Full-body vertical framing, slow walks, and high heels become core visual language.\\\n\\\n### **Compact brat doll**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Shorter, compressed proportions; everything reads “small but concentrated.”\\\n* **Narrative:** Scenes use proximity and scale—other characters and environments make them look tiny and dangerous.\\\n\\\n### **Natural powerlifter**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Thick, functional musculature; sturdy frame with visible strength.\\\n* **Narrative:** Blocking emphasizes lifting, carrying, bracing; sex appeal comes from power and stability.\\\n\\\n### **Soft sinful plush**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Overall soft, pillowy body; minimal hard angles or sharp lines.\\\n* **Narrative:** Close-ups of squeeze, compression, and jiggle; comfort-corruption fantasy in framing.\\\n\\\n### **Cyber-engineered perfection**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Proportions feel too ideal or tuned to be natural; almost uncanny.\\\n* **Narrative:** Shots highlight symmetry, inhuman smoothness, and tech/augmentation fetish angles.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 5. **Primary Erotic Priority**\\\n\\\n### **Tits**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Upper body dominates attention—cleavage, shape, motion.\\\n* **Narrative:** Framing, wardrobe, and blocking keep chest in play; camera often sits at mid-chest height.\\\n\\\n### **Ass**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Rear view is the main event; back-facing poses are lethal.\\\n* **Narrative:** Over-the-shoulder, walking-away, bending, and seated shots are the primary goon fuel.\\\n\\\n### **Legs**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Thighs and calves do the heavy lifting visually; stance and stride matter.\\\n* **Narrative:** Full-body and three-quarter shots showcase legs; stairs, leaning, and crossing legs are key beats.\\\n\\\n### **Face**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** The face alone can carry sex appeal—eyes, lips, bone structure.\\\n* **Narrative:** Close-ups, reaction shots, and eye-level framing dominate; lust is driven by expression.\\\n\\\n### **Back/arch**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Spine line, back muscles, and arching posture are the erotic core.\\\n* **Narrative:** Backs turned to camera, stretching, and overhead views are staged as main erotic moments.\\\n\\\n### **Waist/tummy**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Midsection—the curve of waist, abs, or soft belly—is the fetish point.\\\n* **Narrative:** Cropped tops, side views, and hand-on-waist shots repeatedly highlight this area.\\\n\\\n### **Lips/mouth**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Mouth, teeth, tongue, and lip movements dominate their allure.\\\n* **Narrative:** Dialogue, smoking, drinking, licking, and breathing shots become micro-porn in themselves.\\\n\\\n### **Eyes/eye-contact**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Eye shape, gaze, and how they look at others is the whole weapon.\\\n* **Narrative:** Scenes hinge on eye contact; stare-downs and glances replace explicit action.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 6. **Secondary Erotic Priority**\\\n\\\n### **Thighs**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Thighs feel like traps—squeezing, pinning, or wrapping is implied.\\\n* **Narrative:** Sitting, crossing legs, and lap shots hint at constriction and capture.\\\n\\\n### **Collarbone/shoulders**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Upper chest and shoulder line are delicate or sharp focal points.\\\n* **Narrative:** Off-shoulder clothing, strap slips, and head tilts emphasize vulnerability or poise.\\\n\\\n### **Voice/breath**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Sound—tone, rhythm, breathing—is integral to their sex appeal.\\\n* **Narrative:** Mic’d whispers, laughs, gasps, and vocal tics become erotic punctuation in scenes.\\\n\\\n### **Neck**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Neck line invites bites, kisses, or touch; often elongated or elegantly framed.\\\n* **Narrative:** Tilted heads, hair up, and lighting across the throat become recurring motifs.\\\n\\\n### **Hands**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Fingers, nails, and hand movements are unusually compelling.\\\n* **Narrative:** Shots linger on how they touch objects, themselves, or others; hands telegraph intent.\\\n\\\n### **Feet**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Feet and arches are notable—either pretty, small, or intense.\\\n* **Narrative:** Barefoot scenes, shoes-off beats, and subtle foot movement integrate the fetish layer.\\\n\\\n### **Hair**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Hair is a prop—grab handle, curtain, or halo depending on styling.\\\n* **Narrative:** Hair flips, tying/untiying, and wet hair shots are built-in erotic beats.\\\n\\\n### **Scars/markings**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Visible scars, tattoos, or marks add danger, history, or “owned” vibes.\\\n* **Narrative:** Camera isolates these marks as lore—tracking shots, fingertip tracing in intimate scenes.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 7. **Skin Aesthetic**\\\n\\\n### **Porcelain doll**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Very smooth, pale, almost fragile-looking skin.\\\n* **Narrative:** Lighting stresses delicacy and breakability; bruises or blush stand out dramatically.\\\n\\\n### **Golden tan**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Warm, sun-kissed tone that suggests outdoors, health, or hedonism.\\\n* **Narrative:** Beach, gym, or luxury settings pop; highlights and sweat reads are especially strong.\\\n\\\n### **Ethereal pale**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Light skin with an almost ghostly, soft, or otherworldly quality.\\\n* **Narrative:** Works with cool lighting, moonlight, and surreal scenes; contrasts heavily with blood/darkness.\\\n\\\n### **Warm caramel**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Rich, warm mid-brown tones; inviting, edible vibe.\\\n* **Narrative:** Candlelight, gold accents, and close-ups on touch amplify warmth and intimacy.\\\n\\\n### **Olive temptation**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Neutral to greenish undertones; Mediterranean/earthy feel.\\\n* **Narrative:** Plays well with natural, stone, and urban palettes; sensual but grounded.\\\n\\\n### **Freckled trap**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Freckles across face/body add youth, playfulness, and texture.\\\n* **Narrative:** Close-ups kiss those patterns; freckles amplify “innocent corruption” or sun-worn realism.\\\n\\\n### **Smooth latex sheen**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Skin reads almost artificial in gloss—sweat, oil, or inherent shine.\\\n* **Narrative:** High-shine lighting, oil/sweat shots, and fetish materials blend seamlessly with their look.\\\n\\\n### **Soft touch-addict**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Skin visually implies softness and warmth—people want to touch it.\\\n* **Narrative:** Hands on skin, squeezing, and imprint shots convey comfort plus lust.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 8. **Chest Architecture**\\\n\\\n### **Perky round**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** High, rounded breasts with strong bounce and uplift.\\\n* **Narrative:** High-cut tops, sports bras, and movement shots highlight vertical motion.\\\n\\\n### **Heavy natural spill**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Larger, weighty breasts that spill and hang more naturally.\\\n* **Narrative:** Leaning, lying down, and low-cut clothing showcase mass and overflow.\\\n\\\n### **Small violent perfect**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Smaller chest but sharply defined; “knife” more than “pillow.”\\\n* **Narrative:** Focus on erectness, outline under fabric, and intensity rather than mass.\\\n\\\n### **Fake bolt-ons**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** High, immobile implants with round, unyielding shape.\\\n* **Narrative:** Idol/stripper energy; works with tight tops, bikinis, and deliberate artificiality.\\\n\\\n### **Side-boob architecture**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Shape and width optimized for side angles.\\\n* **Narrative:** Side-cut tops, arm lifts, and profile shots become default cheat codes.\\\n\\\n### **Underboob worship**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Breasts sit low enough or tops are short enough for constant underboob flashes.\\\n* **Narrative:** Crop tops and stretching shots weaponize the lower curve as tease.\\\n\\\n### **Soft approachable handfuls**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Mid-size, easy-to-imagine grab; approachable rather than extreme.\\\n* **Narrative:** Comfort and intimacy shots (cuddling, spooning) lean on chest as safe zone.\\\n\\\n### **Torpedo projection**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Breasts project sharply forward; noticeable from any side.\\\n* **Narrative:** Side and three-quarter angles highlight silhouette; clothing stretches outward clearly.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 9. **Hip & Ass Profile**\\\n\\\n### **Shelf-tier dumptruck**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Large, high, and flat-topped—like a shelf.\\\n* **Narrative:** Back shots, tight skirts, and sitting/standing transitions maximize shock value.\\\n\\\n### **Heart-shaped soft**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Tapers in at the top, widens low;

softness prioritized over firmness.\\\n* **Narrative:** Walking, twerking, and impact shots weaponize slow-motion bounce.\\\n\\\n### **Pear geometry**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Hips wider than bust, mass concentrated in lower body.\\\n* **Narrative:** Framing emphasizes lower-half dominance; upper body can be comparatively modest.\\\n\\\n### **Petite weaponized**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Small ass but incredibly shaped, sharp, or firm.\\\n* **Narrative:** Ass works like a precise detail shot, not a wide spectacle; close-ups matter.\\\n\\\n### **High-sitting dome**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Glutes sit unusually high on the body, creating a domed shape.\\\n* **Narrative:** Short shorts, high-cut bikinis, and side angles show the lift and curve.\\\n\\\n### **Donk with dangerous wobble**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Big, rounded, and reactive; the wobble is the fetish.\\\n* **Narrative:** Every step, jump, or bump is a micro-goon event; animation exploits delayed motion.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 10. **Leg System**\\\n\\\n### **Mile-long gazelle**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Legs highly elongated relative to torso, elegant lines.\\\n* **Narrative:** Strutting, long strides, and seated poses crossing legs dominate visual language.\\\n\\\n### **Thunder thighs**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Thick, powerful upper legs;

calves draw attention.\\\n* **Narrative:** Heels, standing poses, and walking shots highlight lower-leg curves.\\\n\\\n### **Clumsy cute stomp**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Their gait reads slightly heavy, stompy, or unrefined—but charming.\\\n* **Narrative:** Scenes use missteps, stomps, or childish walks as endearing erotic beats.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 11. **Waistline Strategy**\\\n\\\n### **Ridiculous corset snatch**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Extremely narrow waist relative to bust/hips.\\\n* **Narrative:** Corsets, belts, and tight outfits exaggerate the squeeze;

may show faint lines.\\\n* **Narrative:** Crop tops, underwear, and stretch shots show control and sleekness.\\\n\\\n### **Low hip-rise tease**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Waistline sits low, drawing the eye to pelvis and hipbones.\\\n* **Narrative:** Low-rise pants, visible V-lines, and “almost showing everything” frames dominate.\\\n\\\n### **Wide gap + tiny center**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Ribs and hips flare with a pinched center; dramatic curve inwards.\\\n* **Narrative:** Straight-on and three-quarter shots show aggressive hourglass geometry.\\\n\\\n### **Hourglass exaggeration**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Classic curvy waist, but pushed just beyond realistic.\\\n* **Narrative:** Works with stylized, anime, or hyperreal looks; silhouette does storytelling.\\\n\\\n### **Cyber-sculpted core**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Midsection appears engineered—surgical, enhanced, or transhumanly optimized.\\\n* **Narrative:** Body-mod, lab, or cyberpunk contexts highlight the “built” nature of their core.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 12. **Movement Archetype**\\\n\\\n### **Predator glide**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Smooth, deliberate movement like a stalking animal.\\\n* **Narrative:** Long tracking shots; they feel inevitable when walking into a scene.\\\n\\\n### **Brat bounce**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Bouncy, energetic movement with attitude.\\\n* **Narrative:** Hip pops, hops, and dramatic gestures; movement itself taunts.\\\n\\\n### **Elegant float**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Light, controlled, almost gliding motion.\\\n* **Narrative:** Works in gowns, long dresses, or surreal scenes; they feel untouchable.\\\n\\\n### **Innocent stumble**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Slight clumsiness or off-balance movements;

camera dips down to catch it at key beats.\\\n\\\n### **Smirk + stare**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Gives a crooked smile while holding eye contact.\\\n* **Narrative:** Ending a shot on this face becomes the standard for “you’re fucked now.”\\\n\\\n### **Arms-up stretch**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Frequently stretches with arms raised, exposing ribs/waist.\\\n* **Narrative:** Used to transition scenes; casual undressing or waking up shots turn erotic.\\\n\\\n### **Breath hitch**\\\n\\\n* **Character:** Audible or visible micro-gasp when flustered or aroused.\\\n* **Narrative:** Sound design leans into this; timing it before a cut or decision amplifies impact.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":23145}]"
