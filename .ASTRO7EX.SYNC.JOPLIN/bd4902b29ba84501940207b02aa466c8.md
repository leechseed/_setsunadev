It argues that security is inseparable from operations and is required to preserve freedom of action, protect combat power, and enable decisionmaking in hostile and uncertain environments. The publication defines security in both tactical and operational terms, explains its relationship to initiative and risk, and describes how security is achieved through active measures rather than static defense. It demands that commanders deliberately balance security with boldness to prevent paralysis while denying the enemy opportunity.\\\n\\\n## TL;DR\\\n- Security is a condition that enables freedom of action, not an end in itself.\\\n- Absolute security is impossible and attempts to achieve it create vulnerability.\\\n- Security must be active, continuous, and integrated with operations.\\\n- Risk is inherent in war and must be managed, not avoided.\\\n- Security preserves combat power and prevents surprise.\\\n- Effective security supports initiative rather than restricting it.\\\n- Security measures must be tailored to the threat and situation.\\\n- All Marines contribute to security through discipline and awareness.\\\n- Commanders are responsible for balancing security and boldness.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Table of Contents\\\n1.

**Therefore:** Security can never be absolute.\\\n- **Claim 2:** Excessive security restricts initiative.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Security must be balanced with boldness.\\\n- **Claim 3:** Surprise undermines combat power.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Security must actively deny enemy opportunity.\\\n- **Claim 4:** Risk is unavoidable in conflict.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Commanders must manage risk deliberately.\\\n- **Conclusion:** Effective security enables freedom of action by managing risk without sacrificing initiative.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Key Concepts & Definitions\\\n- **Security**: Freedom from unacceptable risk.\\\n- **Risk**: Exposure to potential loss or harm.\\\n- **Initiative**: Ability to dictate action.\\\n- **Surprise**: Enemy action taken without warning.\\\n- **Combat Power**: Total force available for action.\\\n- **Active Security**: Continuous measures to deny enemy opportunity.\\\n- **Risk Management**: Deliberate balancing of protection and boldness.\\\n- **Security in Depth**: Layered protective measures.\\\n- **Vulnerability**: Exposure to enemy action.\\\n- **Awareness**: Understanding of threats and environment.\\\n- **Discipline**: Adherence to standards enabling protection.\\\n- **Protection**: Measures to preserve force and capability.\\\n- **Command Responsibility**: Leadership ownership of security decisions.\\\n- **Freedom of Action**: Ability to act without undue constraint.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":8027}]"
