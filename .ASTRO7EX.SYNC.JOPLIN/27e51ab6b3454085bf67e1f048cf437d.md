## Terminology Primer (Read First)

- **Vector** ‚Üí A directional cue (line, arrow, gaze, gesture, motion) that suggests where to look next.  
- **Leading Line** ‚Üí Any line (road, railing, beam, shoreline) that physically points toward a subject.  
- **Implied Line** ‚Üí A line your brain connects (eye direction, pointing hand, aligned edges).  
- **Entry Point / Exit Point** ‚Üí Where the viewer‚Äôs eye first enters/leaves the frame.  
- **Gateway** ‚Üí A high-contrast, sharp-edged ‚Äúdoor‚Äù into the picture; often a bright shape or gap.  
- **Blocker** ‚Üí A dark mass or edge placed to **stop** the eye from exiting and redirect it inward.  
- **Value** ‚Üí How light or dark something is (not color).  
- **Value Contrast** ‚Üí Difference in light/dark between adjacent shapes; the strongest attention magnet.  
- **Edge** ‚Üí The transition between shapes/values/colors.  
- **Edge Sharpness** ‚Üí Speed of that transition; sharper = stronger pull.  
- **Gradient (Value/Detail/Color)** ‚Üí A controlled change across distance; used to push/pull the eye along a path.  
- **Chiaroscuro** ‚Üí Bold light/dark pattern that carves form and **guides** attention.  
- **Falloff** ‚Üí How light intensity drops over distance; can create natural pathways.  
- **Bokeh / DoF** ‚Üí Blur from shallow depth-of-field; isolates and pushes the eye to sharp zones.  
- **Convergence / Vanishing Point** ‚Üí Perspective lines meeting at points that drag the eye along.  
- **Figure‚ÄìGround** ‚Üí Clear subject vs background separation‚Äînon-negotiable for guidance to work.

> Rule to tattoo on your brain: **The eye follows contrast and sharpness along vectors that point inward.**

---

## How to Use This Guide
- **Pick one dominant guidance method** per image (lines, light, or contrast), then **layer** minor helpers.  
- Establish **entry ‚Üí focal ‚Üí secondary ‚Üí loop-back**. If there‚Äôs no loop, add a blocker.  
- Validate flow using **blur**, **grayscale**, and **flip** tests before you polish.

---

## The Guidance Stack (Top-Down Rules)

1. **Value contrast** decides the first read.  
2. **Edge sharpness** locks the focal; softness elsewhere keeps attention from leaking.  
3. **Vectors** (lines, gaze, gesture) decide **direction**.  
4. **Color & saturation** are tie-breakers and accents, not the engine.  
5. **Framing & blockers** keep the eye **inside** the composition.

---

## Techniques ‚Äî Build the Path

### 4.1 Leading Lines (Explicit & Implied)
**What**  
Use real or implied lines to steer the eye **toward** your subject.

**How**  
- Align roads, rails, beams, rivers, shorelines **into** the focal.  
- Bend lines slightly so they **curve inward** rather than shoot out.  
- Stack 2‚Äì3 lines that converge at the focal‚Äôs **value-contrast hotspot**.

**Fixes**  
- If lines point out, add a **blocker** or re-angle so the last segment points in.  
- If lines overpower the subject, **soften edges** and drop contrast on the lines as they approach borders.

**Checklist**  
- Do the lines terminate on the subject, not past it?

---

### 4.2 Gaze & Gesture Vectors
**What**  
Human eyes follow where faces look and where hands/weapons point.

**How**  
- Aim gazes **at** or **near** the focal, not off-frame.  
- Tilt heads or hands a few degrees to intercept the focal‚Äôs silhouette.  
- Use **counter-gazes** sparingly to create loops (A looks to B, B looks back to A).

**Fixes**  
- If a character looks off-frame, add a **secondary subject** there or rotate the head/eyes.  
- Avoid ‚Äústaring into the border‚Äù unless you want exit tension.

**Checklist**  
- Can you trace a **conversation triangle** of gazes that lands on the focal?

---

### 4.3 Contrast Pathways (Value & Edge Hierarchy)
**What**  
Design a **value gradient** and **edge plan** that lead to the focal.

**How**  
- Put the **largest value jump** on the focal.  
- Build a **gradient** (bright ‚Üí mid ‚Üí dark, or vice versa) that flows toward it.  
- Keep **hardest edges** at the focal; use **lost/soft edges** elsewhere to de-emphasize.

**Fixes**  
- If background competes, compress its values (mid-key) and soften edges.  
- Add a subtle **rim light** to clarify silhouette only where needed.

**Checklist**  
- In grayscale **blur**, does the path brighten toward the focal?

---

### 4.4 Color & Temperature Pathways
**What**  
Warm, saturated accents pull; cool, desaturated fields recede.

**How**  
- Reserve the warmest, most saturated color for the focal or stepping stones to it.  
- Use a **temperature gradient** (cool field ‚Üí warm focal) to lure the eye.

**Fixes**  
- If color noise distracts, unify the scene with a cooler wash and **lift saturation** only at the focal.

**Checklist**  
- Is the color story a **single road** (not ten roads) to the subject?

---

### 4.5 Detail/Sharpness Gradients
**What**  
Micro-contrast, texture, and sharpness act like magnets.

**How**  
- Highest **micro-contrast** and **texture** on the focal; simplify elsewhere.  
- Use DoF to blur foreground/background; keep the focal in the sharp **slice**.

**Fixes**  
- If the eye ping-pongs, blur or reduce texture in the offenders; sharpen only key contours at the focal.

**Checklist**  
- Are the **five sharpest edges** clustered around the subject?

---

### 4.6 Negative Space Shaping
**What**  
Deliberate emptiness that funnels attention.

**How**  
- Carve clean **gaps** that point toward the focal (arrow-shaped voids).  
- Use asymmetrical negative space to push the eye across the frame.

**Fixes**  
- If it feels empty-stupid, plant a **small stepping stone** near the focal‚Äôs approach vector.

**Checklist**  
- Does the empty shape **aim** at the subject?

---

### 4.7 Framing Devices (Windows, Tunnels, Vignettes)
**What**  
Put the subject **inside** a frame: windows, arches, foliage, shadow tunnels, vignettes.

**How**  
- Keep inner frame edges **darker/softer** than the subject.  
- Use **tunnel perspective** (darker edges ‚Üí brighter center).

**Fixes**  
- If the frame steals attention, reduce its contrast/texture; let the **inside** win.

**Checklist**  
- Is the subject clearly **inside** the frame, not merging with it?

---

### 4.8 Perspective & Convergence (Horizon, Vanishing Points)
**What**  
Lines that **converge** at vanishing points drag the eye.

**How**  
- Place vanishing vectors so they converge **on or near** the focal.  
- Keep horizon away from heads; avoid ‚Äúspearing‚Äù the subject with horizon lines.

**Fixes**  
- If convergence misses the focal, shift camera position or **nudge the focal** onto the convergence fan.

**Checklist**  
- Do major convergences **land** at the subject or its immediate neighborhood?

---

### 4.9 Patterns, Rhythm & Repetition
**What**  
Repeat shapes/intervals to create a **beat** that steps the eye forward.

**How**  
- Use **progression** (big ‚Üí medium ‚Üí small) oriented toward the focal.  
- Break perfect regularity; a slight irregularity **points** the way.

**Fixes**  
- If pattern is too strong, interrupt it near the focal (gap, color switch, orientation flip).

**Checklist**  
- Can you ‚Äútap‚Äù the rhythm into the focal without getting stuck?

---

### 4.10 Gateways, Blockers & Edge Control
**What**  
Architect the **entry**, **path**, and **no-exit** logic.

**How**  
- **Gateway**: bright/contrasty opening inside the border where the eye naturally enters.  
- **Blockers**: dark masses or strong oblique edges near corners to bounce the eye back.  
- **Edge diet**: soften and darken **borders** unless needed for tension.

**Fixes**  
- If the eye leaks, add a shadow mass, rotate a prop to form a **return arrow**, or crop tighter.

**Checklist**  
- Do corners feel like **turnstiles**, not holes?

---

### 4.11 Light as a Guide (Chiaroscuro & Falloff)
**What**  
Light direction and **falloff** create luminous paths.

**How**  
- Aim key light so brightest planes **lead to** the subject.  
- Use **falloff** so light fades **away** from exits, brighter near the focal.

**Fixes**  
- If a background hotspot steals attention, lower it or shift it behind the focal as a **halo**.

**Checklist**  
- Does the light **climb** toward the subject rather than away?

---

### 4.12 Motion Guidance (Blur, Panning, Trails)
**What**  
Movement vectors teach the eye what to chase.

**How**  
- **Shutter drag** to blur backgrounds while panning with the subject (sharp subject, streaked world ‚Üí eye sticks to subject).  
- **Light trails** and **directional blur** that point at the focal.

**Fixes**  
- If everything blurs equally, the eye has no anchor‚Äîkeep **one crisp island** at the focal.

**Checklist**  
- Is there **one** crisp target amid motion?

---

### 4.13 Text, Symbols & ‚ÄúHot‚Äù Elements
**What**  
Faces, eyes, readable text, arrows, logos‚Äîthe brain prioritizes them.

**How**  
- Place text/faces **near** the focal or on the route to it.  
- Don‚Äôt scatter ‚Äúhot‚Äù items; group them to **reinforce** the path.

**Fixes**  
- If text steals the show, downweight it (smaller, lighter value) or move it to a **stepping-stone** position.

**Checklist**  
- Do hot elements **serve** the focal, not compete with it?

---

## Diagnostics & Stress Tests

- **1-Second Read** ‚Üí Glance and say the subject. If you can‚Äôt, your path is broken.  
- **Blur Test (10‚Äì20 px)** ‚Üí Should still see the route brighten toward the focal.  
- **Grayscale Toggle** ‚Üí If color was doing all the work, your values are weak.  
- **Arrow Pass** ‚Üí Draw arrows over every vector. Any arrows pointing **out**? Fix them.  
- **Border Patrol** ‚Üí Hide the center; evaluate corners: are they pulling? Add blockers or soften.  
- **Edge Count** ‚Üí Mark the 5 sharpest edges. They should cluster at the focal.  
- **Flip Test** ‚Üí Horizontal flip; exits reveal themselves instantly.

---

## Exercises That Build Skill Fast

1. **Vector Map Drill**  
   - Print a piece; overlay arrows for gaze, lines, light, and edges. Remove or rotate any outward arrow.

2. **Three-Route Challenge**  
   - Compose the same scene three ways: (A) line-driven, (B) value-driven, (C) light-driven. Compare grayscale blurs.

3. **Blocker Lab**  
   - Start with a leaky frame; stop leaks using only shape placement and edge softness. No cropping.

4. **Gradient Walk**  
   - Paint a value gradient that ‚Äúwalks‚Äù the eye across the frame to a focal; add edges only at the end.

5. **DoF Island**  
   - With camera or paint, create **one sharp island** (subject) in a sea of blur that still explains context.

6. **Gaze Triangle**  
   - Pose three figures so a gaze triangle loops viewers repeatedly through the focal.

7. **Light Path**  
   - Arrange light sources so brightest planes step toward the subject; dim the rest.

## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)

- **Leading Lines to Nowhere** ‚Üí They must terminate on the subject. *Cure*: redirect line ends or move subject.  
- **Hot Corners** ‚Üí Bright/sharp corners suck viewers out. *Cure*: blockers, vignettes, or value compression.  
- **Equal Sharpness Everywhere** ‚Üí Ping-pong eye. *Cure*: edge hierarchy‚Äîhard at focal only.  
- **Color Noise** ‚Üí Random accents everywhere. *Cure*: unify palette; isolate warm/sat near focal.  
- **Horizon Through Heads** ‚Üí Accidental spears. *Cure*: raise/lower horizon; protect silhouettes.  
- **Ambiguous Figure‚ÄìGround** ‚Üí Subject blends. *Cure*: value separation and clean silhouette first.

---

## Workflow & Setup (Overlays, Apps, Camera/Lens Choices)

- **Overlays**: Keep PNGs for **arrows**, **vignettes**, **tunnels**, and **gradient bars** you can drop on top while designing.  
- **Photoshop/Krita**:  
  - Make a ‚ÄúFlow‚Äù layer group (arrows, blockers, vignettes).  
  - Use **Gradient Map** adjustments to test value paths quickly.  
- **Procreate**:  
  - Drawing Guide + imported arrow overlays; toggle **Gaussian Blur** for fast blur tests.  
- **Cameras**:  
  - Enable **grid** and **level**; assign a custom button for **AF point** selection to keep the focal sharp.  
  - **Lens choice**:  
    - **Wide** exaggerates leading lines; great for tunnels/foreground anchors.  
    - **Tele** compresses and stacks shapes; great for gaze/gesture alignment.  
  - **Shutter/DoF**: Use slower shutter for trails; wider aperture for **sharpness islands**.

---

## Cheat Sheet Summary

- Start with **value path**, lock with **edge hierarchy**, steer with **vectors**.  
- Create **entry ‚Üí focal ‚Üí secondary ‚Üí loop-back**; add **blockers** at exits.  
- Warm/saturated accents are **seasoning**, not the meal.  
- Keep **five sharpest edges** at the focal; soften borders.  
- If in doubt: **blur + grayscale + flip**. Fix whatever fails those tests.

## Extended Glossary

- **Arrow Pass** ‚Üí A markup step where you literally draw arrows over every directional cue to audit flow.  
- **Blocker** ‚Üí A dark/soft mass or angled edge at borders that prevents eye exit and redirects inward.  
- **Bokeh** ‚Üí The quality of background blur; used to simplify and isolate.  
- **Chiaroscuro** ‚Üí Strong light‚Äìdark patterning that both models form and drives attention.  
- **Convergence** ‚Üí Apparent meeting of parallel lines in perspective; pulls the eye along rails to vanishing points.  
- **DoF (Depth of Field)** ‚Üí Range of acceptable sharpness; narrow DoF isolates, wide DoF explains context.  
- **Falloff** ‚Üí Natural decrease in light intensity; can be staged to brighten toward the subject.  
- **Gateway** ‚Üí A bright/contrasty opening that invites the eye into the picture space.  
- **Implied Line** ‚Üí A perceived line created by alignment of shapes, gaze, or movement.  
- **Lost Edge** ‚Üí Boundary where figure and ground share a value/color so the edge disappears‚Äîused away from focal.  
- **Micro-contrast** ‚Üí Fine texture/detail contrast; increases pull locally.  
- **Negative Space** ‚Üí Intentional emptiness that shapes and directs attention.  
- **Vector** ‚Üí Any directed cue (line, gaze, movement, gradient) that suggests where to look next.  
- **Value / Value Contrast / Edge Sharpness** ‚Üí Fundamental levers: light‚Äìdark strength and edge clarity that determine first read and fixation.  
- **Vanishing Point / Horizon** ‚Üí Perspective anchors controlling convergence and spatial feel.  
- **Vignette** ‚Üí Edge darkening/softening to keep attention inside the frame.
