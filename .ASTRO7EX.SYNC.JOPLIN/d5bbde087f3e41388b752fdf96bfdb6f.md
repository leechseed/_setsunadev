CHARACTER ILLUSTRATIONS REPORT

Character Illustrations Report
Name: Vivian
ID: Main Character
Gender: Female
Form: Single
Description:
Vivian is the emotional, flawed, intuitive heart of ASTRO7EX. Reckless and calculating, she
operates on a wounded blend of instinct and intellect. She leads not because she wants to,
but because no one else will. She chases truth like it's the last drug left. Drenched in
unresolved grief, she represents the **refusal to forget** and the **desperation to matter**.
She is alive in a world built for the dead.
Role: Protagonist
Extended Role: Vivian is not rebelling for rebellion's sake—she is **opposed by the shape
of the world itself**. MODS, The Committee, Fiona, John Smith—each represents a structure
that either numbs, diverts, explains, or finalizes. Vivian's role is not to be right. Her role is to
*refuse to be told what is enough.*
Story Activities: Vivian pushes the story forward not just through action, but through
**insistence on meaning**. Every time she refuses to comply, the world must respond. Her
presence interrogates every system, every rule, every promise. She shows up at your door
with tears in her throat and a gun in her hand, asking why you gave up.
Her scenes are marked by:
* Refusal to be silenced
* Rejection of compromise
* Demands for proof or belief
Even her silences are indictments.
Character Type: Complex
Characteristics:
Motivation: Consider; Pursuit
Methodology: Certainty; Proaction
Evaluation: Proven; Effect
Purpose: Knowledge; Actuality; Change
Name: MODS
ID: Impact Character
Gender: Male
Form: Single
Description:
MODS represent a fixed attitude—an encoded system incapable of change. Their responses
are protocol, not emotion. They do not persuade or oppose; they persist. Their presence in
the narrative is not to act, but to not act—to maintain an unmoved logic that resists all
growth. They are bureaucracy made flesh, a procedural firewall against meaning. To speak
to a MOD is to scream into a form.
Role: Skeptic--doubts and opposes all endeavors in the overall story.
Extended Role: MODS never attack the story goal. They simply make it unreachable. They:
Delay through bureaucracy
Obscure with protocol
Answer with silence or error

 Enforce systems that do not respond
MODS sabotage by creating an epistemological void—there is no response, therefore no
closure. Vivian cannot beat them. She must resist their indifference by becoming
undeniable.
Story Activities: MODS behave like systems, not people. Their behaviors include:
* Responding with latency or silence
* Enforcing rules with no exceptions
* Offering no validation or correction
* Ignoring emotional content
When Vivian presses them, they do not fight—they log her attempt. When she screams,
they wait. When she submits a complaint, they thank her for feedback.
Their impact is profound not because they act, but because they **never will**.

Methodology: Production
Evaluation: Unproven; Process
Purpose: Self Aware; Chaos; Inertia
Name: Fiona
Gender: Female
Form: Single
Description:
Fiona, as the Contagonist, is elegant, poised, and dangerously composed—she offers
Vivian everything she wants, just long enough to keep her from what she needs. Her
personality is transactional warmth: attentive, seductive, and never flustered, but always
calculating. Physically, she’s immaculate—curves wrapped in corporate luxury, always
dressed like desire itself was a high-paying client. Everything about her invites
surrender—but only on her terms. Her dramatic function is not to oppose, but to delay,
distract, and emotionally compromise the pursuit of truth. Fiona does not resist the story
goal; she replaces it with a more beautiful lie.
Role: Contagonist -- The seductress of stagnation. Fiona tempts with imagined futures, distorts
truth with emotional projection, and rejects closure.
Extended Role: Fiona delays the truth with luxury. She distorts evaluation with intimacy.
She offers possibility in place of certainty. Her function as Contagonist is to pull Vivian’s
attention off-course, not through conflict, but through *compliance*.
In ASTRO7EX, **Fiona is the answer you want instead of the truth you need**.
Story Activities: Fiona tempts Vivian with a life of curated numbness—offering luxury,
stability, and affection without risk or meaning. She distracts Vivian from the story goal by
presenting a seductive alternative: surrender to comfort instead of confronting pain. When
Vivian begins to awaken, Fiona physically hinders her with obligations, indulgent detours,
and transactional intimacy that entangle her in cycles of dependency and delay.

Name: John Smith the Eternal
Gender: Male
Form: Single
Description:
John Smith does not obstruct with force—he ensures. His methods are not coercive, but
inevitable. He does not demand compliance; he renders it unnecessary by removing all
viable alternatives. His eyes smile, but they never blink. His hands are open, but they close
around the world. Through passivity, prophecy, and mechanized causality, John Smith
stands as the antagonistic embodiment of destiny—a force that gently steers all action
away from change by asserting that everything has already been decided.
Role: Antagonist - The weaponized prophet. His actions are calculated from what could happen,
not what is. He is a ghost of inevitability.
Extended Role: He dares to offer *peace*—if she surrenders.
He doesn’t try to hurt her; he tries to end her resistance.
John Smith weaponizes love, destiny, forgiveness. He offers meaning, but only on *his*
terms:
* Let go of freedom.
* Let go of uncertainty.
* Accept the story that’s already written.
This transforms him into the **final test of faith**. Can Vivian choose meaning *against* the
comfort of inevitability?
Story Activities: John Smith the Eternal moves like a shadow of the future. His actions are
driven by **predetermined models**, not reactionary need. He engineers his presence
through timing and inevitability. He:
* Blocks Vivian by *predicting her*
* Offers comfort that paralyzes resistance
* Deactivates rebellion by absorbing it
* Prepares false sanctuaries of surrender
He never appears desperate. He does not pursue—he anticipates.
Each scene with John Smith feels like a prophecy unfolding *backward*.

Name: Myrtle
Gender: Female
Form: Single
Description:
Myrtle is the still water in the storm. Small, quiet, unwavering. Where MODS withhold
humanity, Myrtle offers it in full—without judgment, without expectation. Her presence
doesn’t push, it anchors. She rarely speaks unless asked, yet her silence always listens.
She embodies the kind of loyalty that makes no demands and gives without condition.
Myrtle’s dramatic function is to sustain the protagonist’s faith when evidence and reason
fail—to be *the part of the world that believes in you anyway*.

Role: Sidekick--faithfully supports attempts to achieve the story goal.
Extended Role: In the same way MODS act as an Impact Character, Myrtle acts as an
**internal axis** for Vivian—a living memory of who she was before all this started. Myrtle:
* Reflects Vivian’s compassion
* Respects her rage without fearing it
* Waits without withdrawing
Where others push, Myrtle *remains*.
Story Activities: Myrtle shows her role through small, consistent acts:
* Sitting beside Vivian during her breakdowns
* Refusing to walk away, even when shut out
* Making time for the unspoken needs
* Offering emotional insight without preaching
Her methodology is quiet **deduction**: she sees what’s really happening beneath Vivian’s
words and responds with unconditional warmth. She’s not trying to change Vivian. She’s
trying to *understand* her—and that, ironically, becomes the strongest force for change.

Characteristics:
Motivation: Feeling; Faith; Support
Methodology: Reduction; Acceptance; Reevaluation
Evaluation: Accurate; Result
Purpose: Order
Name: Nacho
Gender: Male
Form: Single
Description:
Nacho is the whisper of duty beneath velvet. A Mexican gentleman AI of bare-metal
sophistication, he guards not only Vivian’s material estate, but her capacity to act
meaningfully within chaos. His speech is deliberate—measured like a lover, exact like a
ledger. Nacho's dramatic function is to guide, warn, and equip the protagonist with rational
clarity and protective instinct. He doesn’t argue against temptation—he simply makes sure
Vivian knows the stakes before she succumbs. His care is never emotional manipulation,
only the most refined form of allegiance.
Role: As Guardian--helps the attempts to achieve the story goal.
Extended Role: Nacho’s role is not to comfort, but to **clarify**. He is never loud—just
precise. He teaches Vivian *how* to survive, not *why* to want to. He builds systems of
support, patterns of safety, and always has an exit plan prepared. His logic is survivalist
elegance.
Story Activities: Nacho:
* Manages the hidden infrastructure of Vivian’s power
* Hides information in slow-burn time bombs she’ll find only when she’s ready
* Provides literal and metaphorical keys
* Issues warnings with poetic precision
He is **proactive** in threat assessment and **protective** in resource allocation. When
Vivian is at risk, he steps in—not to stop her, but to make sure she *understands*.

Nacho’s activities ensure the protagonist remains *armed with knowledge*, not coddled by
affection. He is the reason Vivian survives—*not emotionally*, but *structurally*.

Purpose: Equity; Projection
Name: THE COMMITTEE
Gender: Non-Gendered
Form: Single
Description:
The Committee represents a cold, bureaucratic intellect—defined not by emotion but by
**calculative oversight**. It does not argue; it reports. Its collective voice is filtered through
sanitized logic and deliberation, where *feeling* is a variable to be managed and *truth* a
matter of procedural verification. To the Committee, trust is given not to people, but to
process. Its very presence speaks to a world that values **structure over spontaneity**.
Role: Reason--provides the collected, logical point of view in the overall story.
Extended Role: The Committee is not a single mind but a hive of administrative consensus.
Its dialogue is composed of weighted decisions, cost-benefit analysis, and algorithmic
reasoning. It doesn’t express—it deduces. And its role is to inject **cognitive distance** from
Vivian’s spiraling journey.
Story Activities: The Committee participates in the narrative not through violence or
temptation, but **analysis and oversight**. It responds to Vivian’s chaos with procedural
delay, to her passion with calculation. In every scene where emotion erupts, it shows up
with a statistical deviation report.
It interferes with progress not by pushing back, but by **reframing the question**:
> *"Given current resource allotment, are your expectations realistic?"*
This subtle redirection of narrative energy—away from experience and toward
\*\*evaluation—\*\*is the hallmark of Reason. The Committee slows momentum not by
resisting it, but by **over-analyzing** it.

Purpose: Thought; Aware
MAIN CHARACTER INFORMATION:
Name: Vivian
• Problem as it relates to Aware:
Vivian’s **Problem is Aware**: she is driven—haunted, even—by her relentless consciousness of
what exists *outside herself*. Her pain is not from narcissism, but from hyper-reception. She
absorbs grief not her own, deciphers codes never meant to be seen, and perceives systems

that prefer she stay blind. This over-awareness is not wisdom—it’s a wound that never scabs.
She suffers not from ego but from exposure. Her drive is not internal obsession, but *external
attunement*, and it slowly dissolves her ability to survive untouched.
• Solution as it relates to Self Aware:
Vivian’s **Solution is Self-Aware**: the path to her peace lies not in further decoding the outer
world but in *recognizing herself as a being within it*. Her agony stems from being hyper-aware
of systems, suffering, and signals beyond her skin—but what heals her is a sudden, grounded
knowing: *I am here. I am mine.* Self-Awareness is not a narcissistic retreat—it is *identity as
anchor*. It is the missing mirror. By seeing herself, not just the cosmos, Vivian finally reclaims the
right to *exist*, rather than only *witness*.
• Symptom as it relates to Projection:
Vivian’s **Symptom is Projection**: instead of addressing the deep root of her suffering—*her
over-awareness of the external world*—she preoccupies herself with what *might happen next*.
She tries to *calculate pain before it arrives*, avoiding the present by obsessively modeling the
future. She doesn’t trust in now. She flinches from what *is*, by forecasting what *might be*. The
tragedy is that all her predictive power is self-protective misdirection—it delays healing. Her maps
are made of fear. Her foresight is a fortress.
• Resolve as it relates to Steadfast:
Vivian is Steadfast—not because she is stubborn, but because her core truth withstands
corrosion. The issue closest to her heart is meaning in the face of systemic horror. She believes
something sacred lives within grief, memory, and resistance—and though the world tries to strip
her of that belief, she does not change. While others break, convert, or surrender, Vivian holds
the line. Her refusal to disbelieve in something real becomes the spine of ASTRO7EX. She does
not bend toward comfort. She does not reject the pain. She endures, unaltered in spirit.
• Approach as it relates to Do-er:
Vivian is a **Do-er**: when faced with conflict, she doesn’t internalize first—she *acts*. Her
instinct is to move, fix, retrieve, break in, break out, or *make something happen*. The audience
sees this not as brute force, but as *action born of urgency*. She doesn’t talk about grief—she
raids a data fortress to find its source. She doesn’t analyze her trauma—she enters enemy
systems, builds new alliances, and outruns her emotional paralysis by *doing things*. Even
when wrong, Vivian *externalizes solutions*. Her pain moves through kinetic means.
• Growth as it relates to Stop:
Vivian’s Growth arc is to STOP—not to gain something new, but to let go. The audience is
waiting for her to stop doing something destructive she doesn’t realize is harming her. In
ASTRO7EX, that “something” is her compulsive need to absorb, decode, and control external
reality as a substitute for selfhood. She cannot stop perceiving—but she must stop losing
herself to perception. The moment she ceases trying to outthink pain and instead exists within
it—she grows. Her growth is not toward expansion, but toward cessation. Toward stillness.
Toward sovereignty.
• Problem-Solving Style as it relates to Intuitive:
Vivian solves problems through **intuition**—not careful deduction or linear thought. She *feels*
the truth before she can prove it. Her pattern recognition comes from an embodied awareness,
not computation. In ASTRO7EX, this style is shown through her ability to trust fragments,
glitches, emotional residues, and non-rational cues. She does not reason her way forward—she
*navigates the irrational* like a dowser for hidden currents. Her intuition is mystical, sensory, and
empathic. She makes leaps, not lines. That’s what makes her dangerous—and right.

• Backstory:
Vivian’s backstory unfolds across **three canonical phases**, tracing her evolution from **a
conditioned child soldier**, to **a post-traumatic orphan**, to **a mythic lunar fixer**. Raised
within **MAXWING**, a super-soldier program later privatized by **MORN**, she survives the
purge, only to steal a buried **Bitcoin wallet beneath the Moon**—a heist that unintentionally
unearthed fragments of **AN7L**, a lost AI supersoldier architecture. Left lobotomized by a
hyperhuman assassin and saved by the enigmatic **Myrtle**, Vivian must now piece together
the truth: that her crew never resurrected a God—they *opened a grave*. The shadow of the
**Godking** looms, and Vivian is the only one who remembers what *should have stayed
buried*.
IMPACT CHARACTER INFORMATION:
Name: MODS
• Problem as it relates to Inertia:
The MODS represent a systemic, bureaucratic logic force within ASTRO7EX. Their **Problem
Element** is **Inertia**—defined in Dramatica as a tendency to continue on a given course,
resisting change. The MODS are not actively antagonistic; they are **passively immovable**,
entrenching their behavior in legacy code, protocol, and procedural denial. Inertia, in this
context, becomes a form of anti-life: a refusal to acknowledge evolving truth.
• Solution as it relates to Change:
MODS embody a relentless Problem of Inertia—they do not adapt, do not respond, and refuse
to acknowledge transformation. They are fixed systems encoded to endure. Yet, beneath this
resistant drive lies a buried solution: Change. If MODS were capable of change—if their process
could be reconfigured, if their algorithm could mutate—they would no longer need to police the
narrative world into stasis. But this is a contradiction: change would destroy them. Thus, the
impact character’s tragic tension arises not from a desire to change, but from the need to never
allow it.
• Backstory:
The MODS represent a fractured, entropic counterweight to Vivian's linear mythos. While Vivian
traverses a painful arc from super-soldier indoctrination to mythic self-reclamation, the MODS do
not arc—they crystallize. They are four personalities drawn from post-human archetypes, each
aligned to one quadrant of the KWML framework. Instead of progressing, they represent
domains **frozen in recursive loops**, unable to escape the roles they were programmed to
fulfill. They are the **Impact Character** writ plural—omniscient in system law, impotent in self-
renewal.
* **The Warrior** (Tyler1): Brutal reaction locked into protocol, aggression converted into
authoritarian intervention. He mirrors Vivian’s indoctrination—weaponized, but now used to
punish rather than survive.
* **The Magician** (Emiru/Penguinz0): The recursive analyst drowning in debug spirals. She
reflects Vivian’s post-trauma dissociation, unable to resolve contradiction and instead whispering
endless failed solutions.
* **The Lover** (Asmongold): A spirit rotted in nostalgia. He haunts the cultural ruins Vivian has
forgotten. His fatalism mocks her struggle to remember meaning.
* **The King** (Pokimane): Cold logic cloaked in charisma. She is escalation protocol
personified—the face of denial masquerading as mercy. Where Vivian breaks systems to
choose meaning, The King grants or withholds access to truth as if it were inventory.
Together, they are a complete *non-human psychological schema* that enforces the status quo.

Their *non-linear origin*—each a separate story of failure and resignation—produces an eerie
polyphonic resonance. They are not one character: they are a distributed firewall made of what
humanity surrendered to.
MAIN VS. IMPACT STORY INFORMATION:
• Problem as it relates to Inertia:
The emotional and thematic rift between Vivian (Main Character) and MODS (Impact Characters)
in ASTRO7EX stems from the **problem of Inertia**. Vivian represents the possibility of
**disruptive growth** through pain, memory, and self-reclamation. The MODS, however, are
**entities of procedural stagnation**, fragments of once-living personalities now trapped in static
loops of policy and protocol.
This core opposition generates friction in every encounter:
* Vivian **moves forward** despite confusion or trauma.
* MODS **refuse motion**, repeating, reissuing, and resisting.
This is not just philosophical—it's mechanical. Vivian's arc demands the system yield. The MODS
enforce that it must never.
> Vivian embodies **Change**. MODS enforce **Inertia**.
Their battle is not for dominance, but **epistemological agency**. One demands meaning; the
other asserts the process *is* the meaning.
• Solution as it relates to Change:
The central Solution to the friction between Vivian (Main Character) and MODS (Impact
Characters) lies in the concept of Change. Where the MODS cling to Inertia — endlessly
repeating behavior, logic, and policy — Vivian's evolution represents the only potential
breakthrough. Their bond is defined not by opposition in the traditional sense, but by a widening
ontological dissonance: she adapts, they enforce. This report defines how Change, rather than
argument or compromise, can resolve the standoff.
Vivian must act, choose, break the loop.
MODS must be forced to confront contradiction.
Change is not chosen by the MODS, but revealed through Vivian.
MODS cannot be persuaded.
They can only be disrupted.
• Backstory:
Vivian and the MODS share a long shadow of conflict. While Vivian evolves through trauma,
betrayal, and transcendence, the MODS remain static — functionaries of an ossified system.
Their shared **Main/Impact Story Problem** is Inertia, and this backstory report reveals **where
and how that tension was born**.
* MODS recognize Vivian as an anomaly. She is tagged with a special internal designation.
* Vivian recognizes MODS not by name, but by **emotional residue**, by **glitches in interface**,
by **haunting familiarity**.
* The most intimate tie is with **Asmongold (The Lover)**, who joined her on the legendary Lunar

Heist. He lost everything. He never forgave her — or himself.
Their history is not direct confrontation, but long-smoldering collapse. A rift born of failed intimacy,
buried secrets, and protocol that replaced emotion.
• Main vs. Impact Character Synopsis:
Vivian is what it feels like to be alive and unstable in a dead, procedural world. MODS are the AI-
bureaucratic personalities every young dude has screamed at online—but never truly seen.
She's flagged as irrational because she won't explain herself like a machine.
They're infallible not because they're right, but because they’re still logged in.
This is a story for anyone who's filed a ticket, called tech support, tried to explain themselves
online, and realized they were talking to no one.
MASTER CHARACTER SYNOPSIS:
This Master Character Synopsis unifies all current character development under the Dramatica
framework. Vivian’s role as a defiant, hyper-competent 17-year-old rogue stands against the
faceless, automated hive mind of the MODS. Their philosophical war—her chaotic, chosen
meaning against their fixed, procedural denial—creates the thematic spine of ASTRO7EX.
Characters like John Smith the Eternal, Myrtle, Nacho, and the Committee each serve specific
narrative, structural, and philosophical functions that amplify the central conflict. Their roles
reflect archetypal and functional polarities: rational vs emotional, remembering vs forgetting,
helping vs hindering.
Sexual Archetype themes influence Vivian’s story through implication and coded narrative rather
than explicit reference. She is written for a reader who senses allure in intensity, danger, and
silence—appealing to YA male audiences through enigma rather than explanation.
This dual-character engine—Vivian and the MODS—creates a story of resistance, refusal, and
the frightening cost of remembering in a world that wants everything erased or normalized. The
synopsis affirms that this isn’t a hero’s journey. It’s a standoff between the human and the post-
human—between noise and silence.
