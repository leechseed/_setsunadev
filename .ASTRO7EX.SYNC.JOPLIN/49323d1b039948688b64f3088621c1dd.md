learning ue 5 guide

learning ue 5 guide


Locked in. Here’s the same UE5 learning track, but rewritten like an ops manual for you to execute. This assumes: you’re starting from zero, you’re going hard, and the goal is cinematic output + music-driven visuals.

I’m going to lay this out in terms of:

1. Setup (hardware, install, config)
2. Daily Drills with exact button-level actions
3. Skill Ladder with pass/fail criteria
4. Output expectations by checkpoint

You run it like reps. No vibes. Do the reps.

---

## 1. SYSTEM SETUP (DO THIS FIRST)

### 1.1 Hardware Baseline

* GPU: 3090 / 4090 class or equivalent VRAM (24GB+ is ideal). Less VRAM = still doable, but you’ll downscale.
* RAM: 32GB minimum.
* Storage: SSD/NVMe with at least 200GB free.
* CPU: 8+ core modern CPU.

Reason: UE5 uses real-time global illumination (Lumen) + high-poly streaming (Nanite). You want headroom so you’re not fighting stutter instead of learning.

### 1.2 Install Order

1. Install Epic Games Launcher.
2. Install Unreal Engine 5 (current stable, not Preview/Beta).
3. Open Unreal once, let it shaders-cache. Don’t skip this.
4. Install DaVinci Resolve (for edit/grade).
5. (Optional future step, not needed day 1) Install Blender.

### 1.3 Folder Structure (create this before touching anything)

Make a main workspace directory. Example:

```
/PROJECTS
    /UE5_SCENES
        /YYYY-MM-DD_[scene_name]/
    /RENDERS
        /YYYY-MM-DD_[scene_name]/
    /AUDIO
        /[track_name].wav
    /LOGS
        /YYYY-MM-DD_notes.md
```

Why:

* Every experiment gets archived.
* You will review growth, not vibes. We are logging evolution.

## 2. DAILY DRILLS (MECHANICAL REPETITION)

Each daily session has 5 drills. You do them in order. You don’t skip.

### DRILL 1: LEVEL + CAMERA BOOT

**Goal:** You need to be able to generate a shootable scene in under 15 minutes from a blank start. This is muscle memory.

Steps:

1. Launch Unreal → “Games” → “Blank” or “Third Person.” Doesn’t matter, pick one and stick to it for the week to avoid decision tax.
2. Name project `YYYY-MM-DD_sceneName`.
3. In the Content Browser, right-click → Create Level → name it `main_level`.
4. Open `main_level`.
5. Place a `CineCameraActor` in the scene (Place Actors panel → Cinematic → Cine Camera Actor).
6. Add a `Directional Light` (if not already present).
7. Add a `Sky Atmosphere`, `Volumetric Fog` / `Exponential Height Fog` if not present.
8. Position the camera somewhere that actually frames something, not default void.
9. Hit Play, stop Play. Just confirm it runs without red errors.

Target time: < 15 min once you’ve done it a few times.

Pass condition: You can always end Drill 1 with “I have a lit level and a camera pointing at something real, not gray checker garbage.”

### DRILL 2: LIGHTING + LOOK

**Goal:** You control emotional tone with lighting and post-process. You don’t guess. You set mood on purpose.

Steps:

1. Select `Directional Light`:

   * Rotate it until you get a strong shadow angle.
   * Change light color temperature (warm/orange vs cold/blue).
   * Lower intensity until contrast looks intentional (not blown out).
2. Add/adjust `Exponential Height Fog`:

   * Increase Fog Density slightly to see volume.
   * Add a Fog Inscattering Color to tint the air (this is basically your “atmosphere color grade”).
3. Add a `PostProcessVolume`:

   * Set it to `Infinite Extent (Unbound)` so it affects everything.
   * In the PostProcessVolume settings: adjust Exposure (lock it manually so it stops auto-correcting), tweak Contrast, Saturation.
   * Add slight Vignette if you want focal draw.
4. In `CineCameraActor`:

   * Change Focal Length (e.g. 24mm vs 85mm) to alter mood.
   * Enable Depth of Field: rack focus on a specific object, blur the rest.

Target time: < 30 min.

Pass condition: You produce 1 still frame (viewport screenshot is fine) that you would screenshot and keep. It has an emotional feel. “Looks like a film still,” not “looks like default Unreal.”

If you wouldn’t screenshot it, you didn’t pass. Keep adjusting.

### DRILL 3: SEQUENCER / CAMERA MOVE

**Goal:** You animate a shot and output motion, not just a still.

Steps:

1. Window → Cinematics → “Add Level Sequence.”
2. Name it `shot_001`.
3. Open Sequencer.
4. Click `+ Track` → “Actor to Sequencer” → choose your `CineCameraActor`.
5. Move playhead to frame 0. With camera selected, hit the keyframe buttons for Transform.
6. Move playhead to ~100 frames (or 4 seconds if timeline’s in seconds).
7. Move the camera forward / dolly / orbit / tilt / whatever you want.
8. Keyframe again.
9. Scrub. You should now see a smooth camera move between those two keyframes.

Bonus: add a Cut Track and create 2 different cameras. This simulates editing.

Target time: < 45 min.

Pass condition: You have a moving shot in Sequencer with intentional camera motion (not just “slow drift,” unless slow drift is the choice). You understand how to set and adjust keyframes without guessing.

### DRILL 4: AUDIO SYNC / RHYTHM MARKING

**Goal:** You stop cutting random. You start cutting with intent.

Steps:

1. Import a .wav of your music/sound into the project (drag into Content Browser).
2. In Sequencer: `+ Track` → Audio Track → drop the .wav onto timeline.
3. Zoom in on waveform. Identify strong hits / drops.
4. Add camera cuts or light intensity changes exactly on those hits:

   * For lighting: keyframe light intensity or fog color at beat moments.
   * For camera: cut to another camera on the hit.
5. Scrub through and watch it with audio.

What you’re doing here is training neural linkage between sound energy and visual motion/intensity. That’s core to music video work.

Target time: < 60 min.

Pass condition: You can point at a frame and say “the perspective changes HERE because the song hit HERE.” If it’s arbitrary, you fail.

### DRILL 5: RENDER PIPELINE

**Goal:** You close the loop. No render = not real.

Steps:

1. Go to Window → Cinematics → Movie Render Queue (don’t use the old “Render Movie” button unless you absolutely have to).
2. Add your Level Sequence (`shot_001`).
3. Output Settings:

   * Format: Image Sequence (PNG or EXR) or Video.
   * Resolution: 1920x1080 for now. Don’t get precious about 4K at the start.
   * Folder: `/RENDERS/YYYY-MM-DD_sceneName/shot_001/`.
4. Render.
5. Bring the render into DaVinci Resolve.
6. Drop it on a timeline with the same audio track.
7. Export MP4.

Pass condition: You end session with a watchable clip with synced audio that lives in `/RENDERS/DATE_sceneName`.

You are stockpiling proof of work.

## 3. SKILL LADDER (PASS/FAIL CRITERIA)

You move to the next stage only when you can do ALL of the below without external help.

### LEVEL 0 → LEVEL 1: “I can operate the engine”

Pass checklist:

* I can launch UE5, create a project, make a new Level.
* I can place a camera and light and move them.
* I can create a Level Sequence and animate a camera.
* I can render a clip and bring it into Resolve.

If yes → You’re Level 1.

### LEVEL 1 → LEVEL 2: “I can create mood”

Pass checklist:

* I can control lighting intensity/color without guessing.
* I can add fog and post-process to create a vibe on purpose.
* I can frame a subject with DOF so the shot doesn’t look like raw gameplay.
* I can do a 10–20 second shot that looks like a cinematic, not a tech demo.

If yes → You’re Level 2.

### LEVEL 2 → LEVEL 3: “I can build a set and shoot it”

Pass checklist:

* I can block out an environment (room, alley, rooftop, forest).
* I can dress it using assets so it doesn’t look empty.
* I can do at least 3 angles in that one environment that all look different (wide establishing / medium / detail).
* I can relight that same environment for at least 2 different moods (e.g. moody blue night vs. dirty sodium orange).

If yes → You’re Level 3.

### LEVEL 3 → LEVEL 4: “I can sync visuals to sound”

Pass checklist:

* I can import audio, line up visual events (cuts, camera hits, light shifts) on beat accents.
* I can generate a 30–60 second sequence with multiple shots timed to a track.
* That cut doesn’t visually drift; it feels synced when watched, not random.

If yes → You’re Level 4.

### LEVEL 4 → LEVEL 5: “I can run a pipeline”

Pass checklist:

* I have a ‘starter scene’ template project with:

  * Default lighting rig I like
  * A CineCameraActor already in
  * A PostProcessVolume with baseline grade
  * Sequencer with tracks ready
* I can go from blank idea → rendered clip → graded export in under one day, alone.
* I am naming and archiving my outputs systematically.
* I am not starting projects from scratch like a rookie every time.

If yes → You’re Level 5.

Level 5 is “I am now a functioning one-person cinematic unit.”

---

## 4. OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS BY CHECKPOINT

Here’s what you should be producing at each phase, no excuses:

### After ~2 weeks of reps:

* 5–10 second clips
* Static environment + moving camera
* Simple lighting/color decisions
* No story, just mood

This proves you can technically drive UE5 and render.

### After ~1 month of reps:

* 20–30 second mini-cinematics
* Multiple shots/editing inside Sequencer
* Synced to actual music hits
* Clear emotional tone (lonely / violent / ascendant / ritual / corrupted, etc.)

This proves you’re not doing tech tests. You’re doing direction.

### After ~2–3 months of reps:

* 60–120 second sequences
* Full environment
* Visual rhythm that tracks with audio structure (intro / build / drop / resolve)
* Repeatable pipeline (you can make “another one like this” in less than a day without reinventing everything)

This proves you’re not learning anymore. You’re producing.

---

## 5. RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Every session ends in a render.** If you didn’t render, your brain will lie to you about progress.
2. **No feature-chasing until you hit a wall.** Don’t say “I need particles / mocap / AI faces” until you’ve maxed lighting + camera. 90% of cinematic power is lighting, framing, timing.
3. **One aesthetic per render.** Do not shotgun 8 looks in one clip. Pick a mood and commit.
4. **Name and archive everything.** You are building a reel and a style library whether you feel “ready” or not.
5. **Never wait to feel inspired.** This is reps. You don’t get romantic in the squat rack. You just squat.

This is how you get dangerous fast.

You don’t “learn Unreal.” You run daily drills in Unreal until your nervous system treats it like a camera and a light kit, not software.

You follow this doc like a training program, you come out of it with footage and control — not theory.
