Not merely information processing, but *apprehending the hidden structure and suppressed truths* governing the universe. The story is propelled by a collective (and conflicting) pursuit to **comprehend what the MODS, MORN, and AN7L have buried**. This is not an action story—it is a cognition war. Understanding the true shape of reality, the past, and the nature of memory becomes a dangerous act of rebellion.\\\n\\\nThe Overall Story casts all factions into epistemological struggle: to decipher what really happened, what was hidden, what was forgotten, and what was rewritten.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🔎 Theoretical Basis\\\n\\\n* **Goal Definition**: Understanding = appreciating the meaning of something\\\n* **Dramatica Domain**: **Mind** (Fixed Attitude) — Characters are stuck in competing ideas of what is true\\\n* **Dynamic Pair**: *Gathering Information* (Learning) vs *Understanding*\\\n* **Impact**: This goal drives social fragmentation, as each faction believes they already understand. Vivian disrupts that belief by presenting *new meaning* to old systems.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📆 Overall Story Goal: \\\"Understanding\\\"\\\n\\\n### **Core Objective**:\\\n\\\n> \\\"To decode what was erased, what was meant, and what remains real.\\\"\\\n\\\n### **Operational Goal**:\\\n\\\n* Comprehend the suppressed truth behind AN7L\\\n* Interpret the origin of MODS and the Godking\\\n* Understand the layered manipulation of memory\\\n* Validate subjective experience against systemic gaslighting\\\n\\\n### **Factions Aligned For Goal**:\\\n\\\n* Vivian and her scattered allies\\\n* Nacho (data truth protector)\\\n* Myrtle (embodied glitch of suppressed truth)\\\n\\\n### **Factions Aligned Against Goal**:\\\n\\\n* MODS (epistemological firewall)\\\n* The Committee (bureaucratic denial machine)\\\n* MORN (capitalist controller of reality logic)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧠 Functional Implementation\\\n\\\n| **Plot Element** | **Illustration in ASTRO7EX**                       |\\\n| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\\\n| **Act I**        | Discovering the inconsistencies in archived truths |\\\n| **Act II**       | Pursuit of corrupted backups and memory fragments  |\\\n| **Act III**      | Revelation of the buried AN7L source code          |\\\n| **Act IV**       | Violent consensus collapse upon full comprehension |\\\n\\\nUnderstanding becomes a kind of forbidden technology. Whoever decodes the system shapes reality—not through force, but interpretation.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 💭 Thematic Lens\\\n\\\n### **Bloomian Themes**:\\\n\\\n* *The Anxiety of Knowing* — Truth becomes unbearable\\\n* *Misreading as Power* — What if misinterpretation wins?\\\n\\\n### **McKeean Stakes**:\\\n\\\n* The story functions on a moral level: to **know the truth** is to risk madness, social exile, or annihilation.\\\n* **Story Climax**: not when something is done, but when something is *understood*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🌌 Narrative Astrology\\\n\\\n### **Vivian's Chart**:\\\n\\\n* **Mercury Retrograde in Scorpio**: Truth-seeker haunted by corrupted intuition\\\n* **Pluto Square Moon**: Compulsion to uncover what was meant to be hidden\\\n\\\n### **MODS Composite**:\\\n\\\n* **Saturn conjunct Mercury**: Procedural thinking hard-coded\\\n* **Neptune in Pisces**: Gaslighting as divine law\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📚 Robert McKee Framework\\\n\\\n* **Character**: Everyone *thinks* they know what's going on\\\n* **Story**: Discovery causes irreversible psychological and social damage\\\n* **Scene Design**: Dialogue becomes **investigation**; interfaces become **interrogation rooms**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🖊️ Harold Bloom Analysis\\\n\\\n* **Vivian** = The postmodern Hamlet. She \\\"knows too much\\\" but *cannot act* until the meaning is fully formed.\\\n* **MODS** = Nietzschean priesthood of digital denial. They enforce forgetting.\\\n* **Climax** = The tragedy of seeing clearly.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🎥 Early 2000s Sci-Fi Anime Tropes\\\n\\\n* **Ergo Proxy**: Cognition as crime\\\n* **Serial Experiments Lain**: Interface as identity\\\n* **Texhnolyze**: Truth has no resolution, only entropy\\\n\\\nASTRO7EX follows in this lineage, using stylish fragmentation and haunting UI as metaphor for epistemological warfare.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✅ Summary of Implementation\\\n\\\nThe Overall Story Goal of **Understanding** forms the philosophical spine of ASTRO7EX. Every action, resistance, glitch, and betrayal revolves around a single goal: *to appreciate the meaning of what was done and what was denied.* The system has buried the truth under layers of silence. Vivian threatens the machine not by fighting it, but by *refusing to misread it.*\\\n\\\n> The goal isn’t escape. The goal is comprehension.\\\n> And once you understand the system—you can make it crash.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5413}]"
