## Overview

This document defines the **Non-Negotiable Invariants** that enforce coherence across scale in *Tombstone*.

This is not a clean-law-versus-outlaws Western.  
It is not a triumphalist frontier myth.  
It is a structural account of **why order is built through violence, why peace is temporary, and why loyalty outlives institutions**.

These invariants remain true across:
- frontier negotiations  
- personal vendettas  
- public shootouts  
- private illness and debt  
- the final reckoning  

They are **constraints on meaning**, not genre nostalgia.

---

## Project Scope

- **Medium**: Feature film  
- **Scale**: Line → Scene → Feud → Town Order → Frontier Myth  
- **Domain Type**: Mythic / violent / relational  
- **Primary Risk**: Treating justice as clean or violence as redemptive  

---

## Defined Non-Negotiable Invariants

### Invariant 1 — **Order Is Established Through Violence, Not Law**

Authority emerges only after force proves decisive.

---

### Invariant 2 — **Peace Is a Temporary Truce, Not a Stable State**

Calm persists only while fear remains balanced.

---

### Invariant 3 — **Loyalty Determines Survival More Than Morality**

Who stands with you matters more than what is right.

---

### Invariant 4 — **Reputation Is a Weapon**

Myth and fear shape outcomes before bullets do.

---

## Invariant Validation Across Scale

### Invariant 1: Order Is Established Through Violence, Not Law

- **Institutional Weakness**  
  Formal authority lacks enforcement power.

- **Narrative Escalation**  
  Stability arrives only after decisive bloodshed.

- **End State**  
  Order follows victory, not procedure.

**Validation**: Law trails force.

---

### Invariant 2: Peace Is a Temporary Truce, Not a Stable State

- **Early Calm**  
  Nonviolence holds only while threats are deferred.

- **Conflict Trigger**  
  Balance collapses instantly once challenged.

- **Structural Rhythm**  
  Violence resets equilibrium, briefly.

**Validation**: Peace expires.

---

### Invariant 3: Loyalty Determines Survival More Than Morality

- **Relational Core**  
  Brotherhood sustains action under pressure.

- **Moral Tradeoffs**  
  Justice bends to protect one’s own.

- **Outcome Logic**  
  The loyal endure; the isolated fall.

**Validation**: Bonds outweigh principles.

---

### Invariant 4: Reputation Is a Weapon

- **Mythic Framing**  
  Names and stories precede confrontation.

- **Psychological Warfare**  
  Fear decides encounters before shots are fired.

- **Narrative Payoff**  
  Legend amplifies lethality.

**Validation**: Belief kills early.

## Scale Enforcement Matrix

| Scale | Enforcement Question | Tombstone Result |
|------|----------------------|------------------|
| Line | Is law sufficient to maintain order? | No |
| Scene | Does restraint prevent escalation? | No |
| Feud | Does morality dictate outcomes? | No |
| Town | Does peace stabilize permanently? | No |
| Myth | Does reputation matter less than force? | No |

---

## Failure Tests (What Dies)

The following are structurally disallowed:

- Law prevailing without violence  
- Peace achieved through negotiation alone  
- Moral purity ensuring survival  
- Reputation treated as cosmetic  
- Endings that cleanse violence retroactively  

If any appear, *Tombstone* collapses into sanitized Western fantasy.

---

## Operational Outcome

Because these invariants are enforced:

- Violence feels inevitable rather than gratuitous  
- Brotherhood anchors the emotional core  
- Justice reads as personal, not institutional  
- Mythology carries tactical weight  
- The ending feels earned but costly  

---

## Summary

*Tombstone* maintains coherence by enforcing hard frontier constraints:

- order follows violence  
- peace is provisional  
- loyalty outranks morality  
- reputation is weaponized  

The film works because **the West is stabilized, not civilized**.

**If law conquered the frontier, *Tombstone* would be a lie.**
