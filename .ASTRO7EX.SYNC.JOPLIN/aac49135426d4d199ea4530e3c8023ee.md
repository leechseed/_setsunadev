# MCDP 1-2 — Campaigning (Knowledgebase Summary)

## Abstract
Campaigning describes how commanders use operational art to link tactical actions to strategic purpose through a coherent sequence of operations. A campaign is not a pile of battles. It is a purposeful design that uses time, space, and force to attain a strategic aim that cannot be achieved by a single engagement. Campaigning demands clarity of aim, focus on what is decisive, and the discipline to sequence and coordinate actions so they produce cumulative strategic effect. It requires constant orientation on the objective, the ability to exploit opportunity, and the capacity to adapt under friction and uncertainty while preserving unity of effort.

## TL;DR
- A **campaign** is a sequence of related operations aimed at achieving a **strategic objective**.
- The **operational level** links **tactics** to **strategy** by designing and conducting campaigns.
- Campaigning is the practical expression of **operational art**: deciding when and where to fight, and when to refuse battle.
- Campaign design begins with the **strategic aim** and a coherent **campaign concept**.
- Campaigns focus on what is decisive by identifying **centers of gravity** and attacking them through **critical vulnerabilities**.
- Effective campaigning relies on **tempo**, **surprise**, and **synergy** to impose advantage and dislocate the enemy system.
- **Phasing** organizes extended action but must remain flexible; rigidity collapses under friction.
- Command and control must preserve **unity of effort** while enabling subordinate initiative and adaptation.
- Sustainment is not support to operations; it is a condition of operational reach and freedom of action.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### Foreword / Preface
- Campaigning is concerned with operational art and the conduct of campaigns.
- The campaign is the mechanism that turns tactical actions into strategic results.
- The publication is intended to educate judgment and improve how Marines think about large-scale military problems.

### Introduction
- Tactical excellence is necessary but not sufficient; it must be made strategically meaningful through a campaign.
- The operational level exists because strategy usually cannot be achieved through a single battle.
- Campaigning is a disciplined way of thinking, not a checklist of steps.

### Chapter 1 — The Operational Level

#### Levels of War
- **Strategy** concerns the political purpose of the war and the objectives sought.
- **Tactics** concerns fighting battles and engagements.
- The **operational level** links the two by designing and conducting campaigns that connect tactical results to strategic objectives.

#### The Campaign
- A campaign is a sequence of related operations aimed at achieving a strategic objective.
- The campaign provides unity of purpose to operations distributed in time and space.
- The campaign is judged by strategic effect, not by local success.

#### Operational Art
- Operational art is the commander’s skill in designing and conducting a campaign.
- It is the discipline of deciding when and where to fight, and when to refuse battle.
- It seeks decision through a coherent sequence of actions rather than through isolated engagements.

### Chapter 2 — Designing the Campaign

#### Strategic Aim
- Campaign design begins with the strategic aim.
- Strategic aims often express a basic choice of logic: decisive destruction of capacity to resist or cumulative pressure over time.
- The aim determines what “decision” means and what must be attacked, protected, and sequenced.

#### Centers of Gravity and Critical Vulnerabilities
- Campaign design focuses on what is decisive by identifying the enemy’s center of gravity.
- Decisive effect is often achieved through critical vulnerabilities rather than by direct attack on strength.
- Understanding the enemy system is a condition of valid design. Mirror-imaging and stereotypes corrupt planning.

#### The Campaign Concept
- The campaign concept is the single unifying idea that links operations into a coherent whole.
- It establishes the general scheme for achieving the objective, including how advantage will be created and exploited.
- A sound concept is simple, clear, and adaptable. It provides direction without over-prescription.

#### Phasing the Campaign
- Phasing organizes extended action into manageable episodes.
- Phases support sequencing and transitions but are not rigid schedules.
- Phasing must remain flexible because friction and enemy adaptation will disrupt timetables and assumptions.

#### The Campaign Plan
- The campaign plan expresses the campaign concept in a practical configuration of operations.
- It balances clarity with flexibility: near-term detail with long-term generality.
- It must include sustainment logic, because operational reach is a decisive constraint.

### Chapter 3 — Conducting the Campaign

#### Strategic Orientation
- Campaign execution demands constant orientation on the strategic objective.
- Without orientation, operations drift toward local fights and disconnected tasks.
- Orientation preserves unity of effort under pressure.

#### Perspective
- Perspective is the ability to see the campaign as a whole across time and space.
- Operational command requires resisting absorption in tactics.
- Perspective prevents the campaign from becoming reactive and fragmented.

#### Surprise
- Surprise creates disorientation and reduces the enemy’s ability to respond effectively.
- Operational surprise can exist even without total tactical surprise if the enemy cannot react at the campaign level.
- Surprise is generated by deception, ambiguity, boldness, and unexpected sequencing.

#### Tempo
- Tempo is the competitive rhythm of action that creates advantage.
- Tempo is not mere speed; it is purposeful speed—action that forces enemy reaction and disrupts coherence.
- Tempo is sustained by decision advantage, cohesion, and logistics.

#### Synergy
- Synergy is the multiplied effect of coordinated actions.
- Campaigning seeks synergy by integrating operations and functions so each supports and amplifies the others.
- Synergy is commanded. It does not occur by coincidence.

#### Command and Control
- Operational C2 must reconcile unity of effort with freedom to adapt.
- The commander provides intent, priorities, and the campaign concept; subordinates adapt execution to conditions.
- Over-control slows tempo and increases friction; under-control dissolves coherence.

#### Sustainment and Protection
- Sustainment enables operational reach and endurance.
- Protection preserves combat power for decisive employment.
- A campaign that outruns sustainment loses freedom of action and becomes vulnerable to disruption.

#### Leadership
- Operational leadership unifies dispersed forces in pursuit of a common strategic objective.
- It requires judgment, moral courage, and the ability to communicate intent.
- Trust and cohesion are operational necessities; they determine whether decentralized action remains coherent.

### Conclusion
- Campaigning is the disciplined application of operational art to translate tactical action into strategic success.
- It depends on a coherent campaign concept, focus on the decisive, and the ability to adapt while preserving unity.
- The enemy will resist, conditions will change, and friction will multiply. Campaigning exists to impose purpose and direction anyway.

### Notes
- Notes support definitions, sources, and doctrinal cross-references.
- They reinforce that campaigning is a way of thinking and judging, not a formula.

## Mental Models

### Model 1 — The Campaign as a Chain of Cause and Effect
- **Model:** A campaign is a sequence of connected operations; each episode gains meaning from the whole.
- **Use:** Judge actions by whether they advance the strategic aim, not by local success.

### Model 2 — The Enemy as a System
- **Model:** The enemy has centers of strength sustained by dependencies; decisive effect comes from attacking the right dependency.
- **Use:** Identify critical vulnerabilities that expose centers of gravity to collapse.

### Model 3 — Concept First, Plan Second
- **Model:** A campaign concept provides unity; detailed plans are subordinate and must adapt.
- **Use:** Preserve coherence by keeping intent and concept stable while methods change.

### Model 4 — Orientation Prevents Drift
- **Model:** Operations naturally drift into local fights and tasks; orientation pulls effort back to purpose.
- **Use:** Repeatedly test whether actions contribute to the strategic objective.

### Model 5 — Tempo is Purposeful Speed
- **Model:** Tempo is speed plus decision advantage; it forces enemy reaction and accelerates disintegration.
- **Use:** Seek to outpace the enemy’s ability to respond effectively while sustaining coherence and logistics.

### Model 6 — Synergy is Commanded
- **Model:** Integration multiplies effect; separation yields additive effort at best.
- **Use:** Coordinate maneuver, fires, intelligence, sustainment, and protection around the decisive logic.

## Argument Map
- **Claim 1:** Tactical actions must produce strategic effect; therefore campaigns are required to connect tactics to strategy.
  - **Therefore:** The operational level exists to design and conduct campaigns, not to manage tactics at scale.
- **Claim 2:** Campaign design begins with strategic aim and must focus on what is decisive.
  - **Therefore:** Identify centers of gravity and attack critical vulnerabilities rather than hardened surfaces.
- **Claim 3:** Coherence requires a single unifying campaign concept and flexible phasing.
  - **Therefore:** Plans must adapt while intent and concept preserve unity.
- **Claim 4:** Campaign execution is a contest under friction; advantage depends on orientation, perspective, surprise, tempo, synergy, and effective C2.
  - **Therefore:** Command must enable adaptation without losing coherence.
- **Claim 5:** Sustainment and protection determine operational reach and freedom of action.
  - **Therefore:** A campaign that outruns logistics loses the ability to choose.
