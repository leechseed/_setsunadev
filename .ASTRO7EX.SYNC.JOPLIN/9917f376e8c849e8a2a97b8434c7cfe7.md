They’re **natural enemies** in specific pairings:\\\n- Grace vs Gnosis: *obedience to the true good* vs *escape through secret knowing*\\\n- Technae vs Wyrd: *repeatable making* vs *non-repeatable happening*\\\n- Grace vs Technae: *gift* vs *construction*\\\n- Gnosis vs Wyrd: *pattern-recognition* vs *pattern-negation*\\\n\\\n### Perspectives\\\nEach power “interprets” the others in a way that creates factional conflict:\\\n- Grace calls Gnosis pride and schism.\\\n- Gnosis calls Grace captivity and fake godhood.\\\n- Technae calls both religious systems inefficient mythology.\\\n- Wyrd calls all three “trying too hard” and then accidentally topples empires.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## The Four Powers\\\n\\\n## Grace\\\n**Definition**: A bestowed supernatural life/authorization that makes a person capable of *holy alignment* and sanctioned action.\\\n\\\n**Core Image**: A seal, a light, an indwelling.\\\n\\\n**How it “has” you**:\\\n- You don’t *take* Grace; you are **given** Grace.\\\n- Grace is **membership in a higher order**, not merely personal talent.\\\n\\\n**What it does (in-world)**\\\n- **Sanctions**: makes certain acts “count” metaphysically.\\\n- **Purifies**: reduces corruption, breaks spiritual contamination.\\\n- **Consecrates**: transforms objects/places into protected jurisdictions.\\\n- **Intercedes**: creates improbable protection that feels *lawful* rather than random.\\\n\\\n**Costs**\\\n- **Obligation**: Grace creates duties; refusal degrades it.\\\n- **Purity pressure**: you can’t carry certain stains without consequences.\\\n- **Institutional capture**: apparatuses will attempt to own your Grace.\\\n\\\n**Primary failure state**\\\n- **Desolation**: loss of indwelling; the “light” stops recognizing you.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Gnosis\\\n**Definition**: Direct salvific knowing—an experiential cognition that exposes the world’s hidden architecture and enables escape from false structures.\\\n\\\n**Core Image**: A key, a fracture, a map behind the map.\\\n\\\n**How it “has” you**\\\n- You don’t receive Gnosis as permission; you **awaken** into it.\\\n- Gnosis is **anti-credential**: your knowing invalidates external authority.\\\n\\\n**What it does (in-world)**\\\n- **Reveals**: you perceive the “operators” behind reality (archons, scripts, masks, false laws).\\\n- **Unbinds**: breaks glamour, doctrinal traps, memetic seals.\\\n- **Routes**: you find side-doors in systems (metaphysical exploits).\\\n- **Remembers**: you recover identity fragments that the world is designed to suppress.\\\n\\\n**Costs**\\\n- **Alienation**: institutions treat you as infection.\\\n- **Over-clarity**: too much seeing can erase ordinary meaning.\\\n- **Predation**: secret societies want to weaponize your awakenings.\\\n\\\n**Primary failure state**\\\n- **Hypertrophy of insight**: “knowing” becomes sterile; you can’t live, only dissect.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Technae\\\n**Definition**: Power-through-making—craft as a mode of revealing that forces the world to become legible and usable under deliberate construction.\\\n\\\n**Core Image**: A forge, a diagram, a machine-prayer.\\\n\\\n**How it “has” you**\\\n- Technae is **repeatability**.\\\n- If you can’t reproduce it, it isn’t Technae—it’s luck, prophecy, or fraud.\\\n\\\n**What it does (in-world)**\\\n- **Embodies**: turns metaphysical truths into artifacts, rites, engines, protocols.\\\n- **Stabilizes**: makes volatile forces safe, modular, distributable.\\\n- **Amplifies**: tools scale power beyond the individual.\\\n- **Defines**: if you can build it, you can bound it.\\\n\\\n**Costs**\\\n- **Debt to process**: shortcuts create rot.\\\n- **Arms race**: Technae escalates conflict because it scales.\\\n- **Bureaucracy**: guilds and standards bodies will strangle innovation for control.\\\n\\\n**Primary failure state**\\\n- **Technic rot**: systems keep running while meaning dies (a dead machine that still “works”).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Wyrd\\\n**Definition**: Fate-as-event—an outcome-bearing force that manifests as non-repeatable convergence, “glitches,” and inevitabilities that only make sense in retrospect.\\\n\\\n**Core Image**: A crow, a stray coin, a wrong turn that becomes history.\\\n\\\n**How it “has” you**\\\n- Wyrd is not owned. It **happens through you**.\\\n- It is **anti-method**: attempts to systematize it provoke misfire.\\\n\\\n**What it does (in-world)**\\\n- **Procs**: improbable timing, perfect accidents, catastrophic comedy.\\\n- **Selects**: puts people on rails without telling them where the rails go.\\\n- **Converges**: pulls threads together across distance, time, factions, plans.\\\n- **Negates**: breaks systems precisely at their point of arrogance.\\\n\\\n**Costs**\\\n- **Unclaimability**: you can’t prove it, replicate it, or reliably summon it.\\\n- **Persecution**: apparatuses demonize Wyrd because it humiliates governance.\\\n- **Backwash**: Wyrd “wins” but leaves collateral you must carry.\\\n\\\n**Primary failure state**\\\n- **False patterning**: when you start explaining Wyrd like a system, it stops being Wyrd and becomes delusion or manipulation.\\\n\\\n**Your interpretation check**\\\nWhat you described—Wyrd as the ridiculed underdog power, the “idiot hero” gravity-well, the cosmic levity, the glitch/serendipity engine—tracks **extremely well** with how wyrd is often felt in narrative: an impersonal force that can look like randomness, providence, or doom depending on who’s speaking.\\\n- The key to keep it coherent: **Wyrd is not chaos. It is outcome without method.**\\\n- Wyrd is feared because it implies: *your control systems are not real—only your results are.*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Power Governance & Apparatuses\\\nEach power gets a social machine that attempts to:\\\n- define legitimacy\\\n- gatekeep practice\\\n- monopolize interpretation\\\n- punish failure states\\\n\\\n### Ecclesial Apparatus (Grace)\\\n**Institution type**: Church-state metaphysical bureaucracy.\\\n\\\n**Primary governance tools**\\\n- **Sacramental channels**: recognized “pipes” that confer and sustain Grace.\\\n- **Hierarchy**: ranked custody of doctrine and authority.\\\n- **Canon discipline**: penalties for unauthorized practice.\\\n- **Jurisdiction**: consecrated zones where Grace is stronger and enforceable.\\\n\\\n**Failure pressures**\\\n- Schism, simony, politicization, “Grace as credential.”\\\n\\\n### Mystery Apparatus (Gnosis)\\\n**Institution type**: Cult cells, secret schools, scripture-fragment networks.\\\n\\\n**Primary governance tools**\\\n- **Initiation ladders**: staged disclosure.\\\n- **Ciphers & rites**: knowledge encoded as practice.\\\n- **Textual relics**: fragments that “wake” people.\\\n- **Counter-inquisition**: internal policing against infiltrators and false awakenings.\\\n\\\n**Failure pressures**\\\n- Paranoia, narcissism of insight, factional splintering.\\\n\\\n### Guild Apparatus (Technae)\\\n**Institution type**: Lodges, guilds, labs, standards councils.\\\n\\\n**Primary governance tools**\\\n- **Apprenticeship**: skill and secrecy transfer.\\\n- **Certification**: “this artifact counts.”\\\n- **Patents/charters**: political protection of methods.\\\n- **Quality law**: rot-control, audits, recalls, blacklists.\\\n\\\n**Failure pressures**\\\n- Monopoly, stagnation, weaponization, technocratic tyranny.\\\n\\\n### Anti-Apparatus (Wyrd)\\\n**Institution type**: No stable institution—only *circulation*.\\\n\\\n**What replaces institutions**\\\n- **Pilgrimage**: movement as a “school.”\\\n- **Folklore protocols**: sayings, taboos, lucky rules that are half-joke, half-true.\\\n- **Holy fools / idiot heroes**: socially low-status carriers of high-impact outcome.\\\n- **Oracles by accident**: people who are right for the wrong reasons.\\\n\\\n**Failure pressures**\\\n- Co-optation attempts (“we can train Wyrd” → immediate disaster)\\\n- Scapegoating (“Wyrd caused it” → pogroms)\\\n- Counterfeit wyrd (con artists mimicking fate)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Operational Mechanics\\\n\\\n### Acquisition\\\n- **Grace**: bestowed through recognized channels, moral alignment, consecrated contact.\\\n- **Gnosis**: awakening via encounter with forbidden truth, inner rupture, lived revelation.\\\n- **Technae**: trained capability + artifacts + repeatable methods.\\\n- **Wyrd**: entanglement—often triggered by refusal to play the normal game.\\\n\\\n### Use Verbs\\\n- **Grace**: bless, consecrate, absolve, sanctify, intercede, seal\\\n- **Gnosis**: unveil, decode, unbind, remember, bypass, exorcise the false\\\n- **Technae**: forge, bind, calibrate, encode, stabilize, replicate\\\n- **Wyrd**: proc, converge, derail, echo, select, overturn\\\n\\\n### Costs & Corruption\\\nEvery power has a signature “spiritual injury”:\\\n- **Grace injury**: hypocrisy, legalism, “credential holiness,” desolation\\\n- **Gnosis injury**: sterile insight, contempt, obsession, schism addiction\\\n- **Technae injury**: rot, automation without meaning, escalation, technocratic cruelty\\\n- **Wyrd injury**: collateral destiny, incoherence, scapegoating, self-mythologizing\\\n\\\n### Detection & Counterplay\\\n- **Grace detection**: consecrated tests, relic resonance, jurisdictional response\\\n- **Gnosis detection**: memetic tells, pattern breaks, archon alarms, cipher literacy\\\n- **Technae detection**: signature engineering traces, artifact audits, repeatable proofs\\\n- **Wyrd detection**: you can’t *detect* it reliably—only notice the wake (synchronicities, improbable convergences, post-event certainty)\\\n\\\nCounterplay philosophy:\\\n- Grace counters Gnosis by **declaring it illegitimate** and severing channels.\\\n- Gnosis counters Grace by **exposing the apparatus** as a prison.\\\n- Technae counters both by **industrializing** their miracles.\\\n- Wyrd counters all by **humiliating prediction**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Continuity-Safe Expansion Slots\\\nThese are “blank sockets” you can fill later without breaking the framework.\\\n\\\n### Universal sockets (apply to each power)\\\n- **[Rite Ladder]**: 3–7 stages of training/initiation\\\n- **[Credential]**: what counts as “real” power use\\\n- **[Artifact Class]**: 5–12 signature items\\\n- **[Taboo Set]**: 5–12 prohibitions that cause power decay\\\n- **[Saints/Exemplars]**: 3–9 archetypal figures per power\\\n- **[Heresies/Counterfeits]**: how the power gets faked or corrupted\\\n- **[Jurisdictions]**: where the power is stronger/weaker and why\\\n- **[Adjudication]**: how disputes are settled (trial, duel, audit, omen)\\\n\\\n### Cross-power sockets (conflict engines)\\\n- **[Conversion Rules]**: what it takes to move from one power to another (rare, costly, story-level)\\\n- **[Hybrid Exceptions]**: edge-cases where two powers appear in one person (define as scandalous anomalies)\\\n- **[Null State]**: what “powerless” actually means (and how terrifying that is)\\\n- **[Anti-Power Tech]**: tools/rites that suppress powers (inquisition tech, archon nets, rot fields, omen cages)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Story Utility\\\nThis framework is built to generate:\\\n- **Institutional conflict** (governance vs charisma)\\\n- **Personal identity stakes** (what kind of “having” are you?)\\\n- **Moral injury** (each power has a distinct corruption pattern)\\\n- **Escalation without “bigger fireballs”** (power scales via legitimacy, tools, and outcome)\\\n- **Comedy without breaking tone** (Wyrd provides levity *as a terror mechanism*)\\\n\\\nA simple narrative rule:\\\n> When a character “wins” with a power, they also inherit that power’s *obligation and injury*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Reference-Quality Reading\\\nThese are foundational, not bloggy fluff.\\\n\\\n### Grace (Catholic / theological)\\\n- **Catechism of the Catholic Church — “Grace” (esp.
