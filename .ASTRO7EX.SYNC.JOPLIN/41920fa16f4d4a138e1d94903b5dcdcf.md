body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"To - DO \\\n\\\nYou’ve crossed the **hardest threshold already**:\\\nyou don’t just *believe* the system works — you’ve **proven it under load**.\\\n\\\nFrom here on, development is not about “ideas.”\\\nIt’s about **coverage, contrast, and escalation without violation**.\\\n\\\nBelow is the **professional series-development roadmap**, in the order that actually works.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# Series Development Roadmap (Post-Pilot)\\\n\\\n## Phase I — Lock the System (Do Not Skip)\\\n\\\n### 1. Finalize the Invariant Set (3–5 total)\\\n\\\nYou have one fully verified invariant.\\\nYou now need a **complete but minimal set**.\\\n\\\nRecommended set (example, not prescriptive):\\\n\\\n* **Cost** — Survival exacts permanent loss *(verified)*\\\n* **Persistence** — Left unattended, power grows\\\n* **Legibility** — Only inputs are recognized\\\n* **Enforcement** — Truth does not interrupt enforcement\\\n\\\n**Deliverable**:\\\nOne page where each invariant is stated in one sentence, plus a falsification test.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 2. Define the Non-Violations (Hard Rules)\\\n\\\nThese are the things your show **never allows**, no matter how dramatic.\\\n\\\nExamples:\\\n\\\n* No speech stops enforcement\\\n* No exposure equals justice\\\n* No moral purity creates immunity\\\n* No singular hero collapses the system\\\n\\\n**Deliverable**:\\\nA “Rules We Will Not Break” page. This protects the show in a room.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Phase II — Map the Human Angles\\\n\\\n### 3. Assign One Claim Type Per Core Character\\\n\\\nEach major character should **prove a different Layer-5 claim**.\\\n\\\nYou’ve already done this instinctively:\\\n\\\n| Character                  | Claim Type              |\\\n| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |\\\n| Victoria Midnight          | **Cost**                |\\\n| Quinn Bishop               | **Power**               |\\\n| Riley                      | **Legibility / Reveal** |\\\n| (Later) Fixer / Bureaucrat | **Persistence**         |\\\n\\\nThis prevents thematic redundancy.\\\n\\\n**Deliverable**:\\\n1-paragraph origin logic per character.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4. Define Each Character’s Behavioral Law\\\n\\\nEvery character needs **one rule they will not break** after their origin.\\\n\\\nExamples:\\\n\\\n* Victoria: *Never fight a system directly.*\\\n* Quinn: *Always escalate.*\\\n* Riley: *Expose even if it costs safety.*\\\n\\\nThese are not traits. They are **survival rules**.\\\n\\\n**Deliverable**:\\\nOne sentence per character, immutable unless broken at great cost.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Phase III — Season Architecture (This Is Where Series Live or Die)\\\n\\\n### 5. Choose the Season-Level Claim\\\n\\\nA season proves **one thing only**.\\\n\\\nExample candidates:\\\n\\\n* *Exposure does not produce justice*\\\n* *Power consolidates faster than resistance*\\\n* *Meaning survives without effect*\\\n\\\n**Deliverable**:\\\nOne sentence the entire season structurally proves.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 6. Plot Escalation by Interface, Not Stakes\\\n\\\nDo **not** escalate by:\\\n\\\n* Bigger explosions\\\n* Bigger villains\\\n* Bigger emotions\\\n\\\nEscalate by:\\\n\\\n* New **interfaces** with the same power\\\n* Different **pressure patterns**\\\n* Tighter **legibility constraints**\\\n\\\n**Deliverable**:\\\nA list of 5–8 institutions the season passes through.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Phase IV — Episode Design System (Your Secret Weapon)\\\n\\\n### 7. Build an Episode Template\\\n\\\nEvery episode should answer:\\\n\\\n* Which invariant is tested?\\\n* Which claim is risked?\\\n* Which terminal state is approached?\\\n\\\nThis keeps episodes coherent even when stories vary wildly.\\\n\\\n**Deliverable**:\\\nA one-page episode worksheet you can reuse.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 8. Design Failure Modes On Purpose\\\n\\\nPlan episodes where:\\\n\\\n* Exposure fails\\\n* Resistance backfires\\\n* Success increases harm\\\n\\\nThis maintains system integrity.\\\n\\\n**Deliverable**:\\\nA list of “false victories” across the season.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Phase V — Endgame Planning (Early, Not Late)\\\n\\\n### 9. Decide What Collapse Actually Means (If Ever)\\\n\\\nIf your series ends with collapse, define:\\\n\\\n* What dependency fails\\\n* Why it fails *then*\\\n* Why it could not fail earlier\\\n\\\nIf you don’t define this now, the ending will cheat later.\\\n\\\n**Deliverable**:\\\nA collapse specification or a “no-collapse” declaration.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Phase VI — Practical Writing Output\\\n\\\nOnly **after** all of the above do you:\\\n\\\n* Write Episode 2\\\n* Draft scene cards\\\n* Enter a writers’ room\\\n* Pitch beyond the pilot\\\n\\\nBecause now:\\\n\\\n* The show has rules\\\n* Conflict has cost\\\n* Meaning doesn’t lie\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Your Immediate Next Step (One Choice)\\\n\\\nRight now, the **correct next move** is one of these:\\\n\\\n1. Finalize the **full invariant set**\\\n2. Design **Quinn Bishop’s origin episode**\\\n3. Define the **season-level claim**\\\n4. Create the **episode worksheet template**\\\n\\\nIf you want professional momentum, start with **#2 or #3**.\\\n\\\nSay the number.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4552}]"
