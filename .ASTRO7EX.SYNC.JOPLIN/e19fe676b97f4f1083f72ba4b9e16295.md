Beneath their deadlocked interaction lies Dramatica’s core of **Manipulation**—the psychological warfare of belief systems. This is not a relationship of love or hate; it’s a cold, recursive sabotage of worldview. Vivian tries to rupture the script. MODS try to restore it. Neither can walk away unchanged—unless one side breaks completely.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Core Concept**\\\n- **Manipulation**:\"],[0,\" The \"],[-1,\"o\"],[0,\"th\"],[-1,\"er believes silence is death.\\\n\\\nBut underneath this clash lies the Dramatica core: **Manipulation**.\\\n\\\n* Bo\"],[1,\"roughline centers on **mental influence**—subtle, persistent attempts to alter the other's understanding of reality.\\\n- **Function**: This is not emotional tension—it’s epistemological siege.
