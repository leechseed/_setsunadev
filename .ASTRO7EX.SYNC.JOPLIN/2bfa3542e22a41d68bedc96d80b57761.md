"This world is weird on top and wild at heart." 
Haven't seen much of him for quite some time. 
Last I heard he was reporting the weather, reading the lotto, and....to be honest he can be doing anything and nothing and something or other and if it was anyone else I wouldn't bother. But he's the kind. Of the kind that I can watch watching  paint dry. Only for hours later to startle a poor barkeep with a, 'PAINT, DRY!'  just to make it mean, Something. Funny. But also, deeply moving.  Maybe like 'Meaning is Fleeting as is Chasing a Feeling. As in Needing a Meaning in Life isn't Living. Its Agony. ~Ennui.

...No. No thats not the word. Ah, sublime. Thats the word. That's him.
