## 1. Structural Theory – What Is a Main Character Issue?

The **Main Character Issue** in Dramatica is the *thematic lens* through which the protagonist interprets their journey. This value, often unconscious, shapes how they judge others, themselves, and the path ahead.

> Vivian’s Issue is **Destiny**—the future path she believes she must walk, whether she chooses it or not.

Her emotional conflict stems from how she frames her decisions in relation to **a predetermined arc**. The story’s tragedy and liberation emerge from this tension.

---

## 2. Dramatica Definition – *Destiny*

> **Destiny**: The path an individual must take—the course of action that lies ahead, shaped by who and what they are.
>
> **Dynamic Pair**: *Fate*—the situation that will inevitably occur, regardless of one's path.

Destiny is about **movement toward inevitability**. It implies **narrative gravity**—not what happens, but what must be pursued. It is the pressure of a *story already written*, and the fear that deviation is **not permitted**.

---

## 3. Vivian’s Expression – The Weight of a Prewritten Future

Vivian lives with a deep belief that her life was *scripted*—not by faith, but by **conditioning, legacy, and trauma**.

### Manifestations of Destiny in Vivian’s Story:

* **MAXWING Origins**: Raised to be a weapon, she was *destined to obey*. Every part of her early life was authored by external logic.
* **The Heist**: Seen by others as her “calling,” but to her, it was **inevitable rebellion**—a role she could not *not* play.
* **The Collapse of MODS**: She believes she was *meant* to break them—yet questions if this belief is just another **prewritten subroutine**.
* **The Lobotomized Crew**: She was the one who lived. The one who remembered. The one with access. *Why?* She fears the answer is **destiny**.

> Destiny becomes Vivian’s cage—not because it’s enforced, but because it **feels authored**. Even when she rebels, she wonders: *Am I just fulfilling another prophecy?*

---

## 4. Behavioral Consequences – How Destiny Shapes Vivian’s Psychology

Vivian’s belief in destiny produces a **fractured psychology**:

* **Self-Suspicion**: She doubts her choices, fearing they’re not her own—only simulations of rebellion.
* **Mythic Self-Perception**: She sees herself as *fated to break the system*, which inflates her sense of burden and isolates her.
* **Fatalistic Romance with Death**: She toys with self-destruction, not out of depression, but as a **final refusal** of the path given to her.
* **Messianic Loathing**: She’s aware others see her as a savior—she loathes this, because it mirrors the scripts she’s tried to flee.

She does not simply fight the system—she fights the **idea** that her fight was always meant to happen.

---

## 5. Critical Commentary – From Mythic Heroine to Haunted Variable

### 📚 **Harold Bloom – The Burden of Literary Destiny**

* Vivian inherits too many **narrative roles**: messiah, rebel, thief, woman-on-the-edge.
* Bloom would argue: she must **misread** these roles—not play them—to be free.
* Her refusal to embody her mythic destiny is her **creative survival**.

### 🧭 **Joseph Campbell – Hero as Archetype of Destiny**

* Vivian’s path mirrors the Hero’s Journey—but with one profound deviation:

  * She *never accepts the boon*.
  * She doesn’t return.
  * She **refuses closure**.
* This makes her post-heroic—defined not by journey, but by **narrative rejection**.

### 🎭 **Robert McKee – Destiny Revealed in Pressure**

* Under extreme narrative compression (the heist, the countdown), she defaults to *instinct*, not design.
* Her real “destiny” is not what she believes—but what she chooses in collapse.

### 🎞️ **2000s Sci-Fi Anime – The Destined Ghost**

* Vivian’s arc echoes *Ergo Proxy*, *Texhnolyze*, and *Lain*.
* In these stories, “destiny” is a trap—often revealed to be a **program**, a **simulation**, or a **lie told by the dead**.
* Vivian is not discovering her path. She is **refusing the lie of one**.

---

## 6. Narrative Astrology – Fated Transits and Broken Paths

### **Vivian’s Natal Chart**

* **North Node in Scorpio**: A karmic pull toward transformation—rebirth through destruction.
* **Pluto conjunct Ascendant**: Born to embody *death energy*—her very presence erodes systems.

### **Transits**

* **Saturn square Midheaven**: Her public “role” clashes with her authentic path.
* **Neptune trine Moon**: The emotional fog of destiny—intuition is powerful, but misleading.

### **Progressions**

* **Progressed Sun enters 12th House**: Vivian fades from visibility—destiny becomes *invisible*, mystical, or internalized.
* **Progressed Venus conjunct Uranus**: Love becomes rupture—relationships force unexpected new paths.

## 7. Audience Position – The Moral Weight of Destiny

> **Scale**: 11-Point Evaluation
> **Position**: **8/11 → Disadvantageous**

Destiny in ASTRO7EX is **not romantic**. It is **a story pretending to be a future**.

The audience should feel:

* **Sympathy** for Vivian’s sense of purpose—her burden is real.
* **Dread** at how Destiny nullifies freedom.
* **Liberation** when she **disobeys even her own expectations**.
* **Clarity** when she stops *asking what she’s meant to do* and simply *acts*.

The tragedy is not that she must fulfill her destiny—
It’s that **everyone around her believes she must**.

---

## 8. Summary – Destiny as Vivian’s Thematic Axis

Vivian’s entire character revolves around the **fear that she was written before she began**.
She is not afraid of the future—she is afraid that **it’s already been assigned**.
That her rebellion is a **loop**, not a rupture.
That her freedom is a **performance**, not a possibility.

> Her Issue is not belief in Destiny—
> It’s the **terror of enacting it**.

Her arc becomes about locating a moment that isn’t authored.
Not escaping the system.
But proving, even once, that she wasn’t its endpoint.

# 🛑 Dramatica Story Limit — *Optionlock*

> There are **seven lobotomized crew minds**, each one a **fixed route to buried truth**.
> These minds contain **partially preserved fragments** of the original ASTRO7EX mission—and the only ways left to learn what really happened.

### Key Conditions:

* Each mind can be accessed **once**—a singular attempt at reclamation.
* A failed attempt means that **version of the truth is sealed forever**.
* These minds are **the gates of narrative possibility**.

### Climax Trigger:

> The story reaches its crisis at the **seventh and final gate**.
> There are no more options.
> Only the last attempt. Only one truth left to find.
> And no more reboots.

**This is the Optionlock.**
The collapse doesn’t come when the truth is found—
It comes when **no truths remain**.
