Fix what fails. Don‚Äôt argue with results.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Landscape\\\n**Intent & Priorities**  \\\nSense of place; scale; atmosphere. First read = subject landmark or light event.\\\n\\\n**Armature / Flow**  \\\n- **Thirds** for horizon; **S-curve** for roads/rivers; **Diagonal thrust** for slopes.  \\\n- Avoid centering horizon unless symmetry/mirror is the point.\\\n\\\n**Depth Strategy**  \\\n- Fore/Mid/Back with **atmospheric perspective**. Foreground anchor (rock, grass, figure).  \\\n- Wide lens? Put something compelling in the near plane or it‚Äôll look empty.\\\n\\\n**Light & Color**  \\\n- Low sun for raking texture; protect value hierarchy (sky ‚â† blown).  \\\n- Warm accents in near/mid; cool the distance.\\\n\\\n**Placement & Cropping**  \\\n- Keep horizon off heads; protect silhouettes (trees, peaks).  \\\n- Crop decisively‚Äîno slivers of almost-something on edges.\\\n\\\n**Common Pitfalls**  \\\nMidtone soup; horizon dead center; no foreground; tiny subject lost in noise.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\nFocal in 1 sec? Three planes? Clean horizon? Foreground leads **in**?\\\n\\\n**Exercises**  \\\nThree thumbnails per scene: (A) low horizon, (B) high horizon, (C) centered symmetry; compare in grayscale.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Portrait (Headshot & Environmental)\\\n**Intent & Priorities**  \\\nThe person‚Äîeyes first‚Äîthen story context (environmental).\\\n\\\n**Armature / Flow**  \\\n- **Eyes on upper third / phi**. **C-curve** or **L-composition** to cradle.  \\\n- For environmental: **Diagonal thrust** to lead into subject.\\\n\\\n**Depth Strategy**  \\\n- Separate head from background (value, color, or rim).  \\\n- Soft fore occluder for depth; background 1‚Äì2 stops less contrast.\\\n\\\n**Light & Color**  \\\n- Catchlights; soft key + controlled fill; avoid raccoon eyes.  \\\n- Skin tones rule; let background be cooler/less saturated.\\\n\\\n**Placement & Cropping**  \\\n- **Don‚Äôt crop at neck/chin/wrists/elbows**. Keep lead room in gaze direction.\\\n\\\n**Common Pitfalls**  \\\nHorizon through head; busy background; equal sharpness everywhere.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\nEyes sharp? Clean silhouette? Headroom/chinroom sane? Background muted?\\\n\\\n**Exercises**  \\\nOne subject, 6 safe crops; then 3 environmental portraits with story props that don‚Äôt steal the read.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Still Life / Product (E-comm & Advertising)\\\n**Intent & Priorities**  \\\nClarity of form & label (e-comm). Desire & story (advertising).\\\n\\\n**Armature / Flow**  \\\n- **Triangles** for sets; **thirds/phi** for hero placement.  \\\n- For ad comps, **Spiral** into brand mark or feature.\\\n\\\n**Depth Strategy**  \\\n- Shallow DoF for isolation or deep DoF for sets‚Äîdecide.  \\\n- Cast shadows + AO to glue objects; avoid floating.\\\n\\\n**Light & Color**  \\\n- Control **speculars**; define shape with edge highlights.  \\\n- Background simpler than product; brand color as accent only.\\\n\\\n**Placement & Cropping**  \\\n- Cheat labels **flat to camera**; avoid tangent merges with props.  \\\n- Leave copy space where layout needs it.\\\n\\\n**Common Pitfalls**  \\\nHot, blown speculars; label glare; over-busy surfaces.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\nBrand readable at thumbnail? Form readable in grayscale? No tangent disasters?\\\n\\\n**Exercises**  \\\nShoot a glossy bottle: one broad softbox pass, one hard-edge rim pass. Compare label legibility.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Architecture (Exterior & Interior)\\\n**Intent & Priorities**  \\\nStructure, rhythm, materiality; human scale.\\\n\\\n**Armature / Flow**  \\\n- **Symmetry** for monuments; **diagonals** for approach; **repetition rhythms** for facades.  \\\n- Interiors: **L-composition** or **1-point** for axial statements; **2-point** for corners.\\\n\\\n**Depth Strategy**  \\\n- Correct verticals (no accidental keystone).  \\\n- Layer view: foreground frame (door/column) ‚Üí volume ‚Üí opening/light.\\\n\\\n**Light & Color**  \\\n- Planar lighting for materials; avoid mixed color casts unless narrative.  \\\n- Interiors: use **practicals** to anchor warm spots; daylight as cool fill.\\\n\\\n**Placement & Cropping**  \\\n- Keep lines true; don‚Äôt amputate key features at the frame.  \\\n- Include a human or familiar object occasionally for scale.\\\n\\\n**Common Pitfalls**  \\\nTilted horizons; chaotic furniture; blown windows.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\nVerticals plumb?

Story beats first, cleverness later.\\\n\\\n**Armature / Flow**  \\\n- **Thirds** for safety; **diagonals** for motion; **Zig-zag** for layered crowds.\\\n\\\n**Depth Strategy**  \\\n- Layer silhouettes; backlight haze/rain for separation.  \\\n- Fore occluders (door frames, people) to sell space.\\\n\\\n**Light & Color**  \\\n- Value hierarchy over color. Kill color noise if it hurts the read.\\\n\\\n**Placement & Cropping**  \\\n- Protect face silhouettes; avoid mergers; leave walk room.\\\n\\\n**Common Pitfalls**  \\\nEverything midtone; clutter with no hero; horizon through heads.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\nSubject first in 1 sec?

Is the hero sharp? Is the moment actually peak?\\\n\\\n**Exercises**  \\\nOne play, 5 crops. Pick the one that screams speed the loudest in grayscale.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Wildlife / Nature\\\n**Intent & Priorities**  \\\nBehavior + environment; ethics of distance; clarity of animal form.\\\n\\\n**Armature / Flow**  \\\n- **Thirds/phi** for the head; **L-composition** or **S-curve** for habitat.\\\n\\\n**Depth Strategy**  \\\n- Tele compression for clean backgrounds or wide with foreground habitat.  \\\n- Separate subject via value/temperature difference.\\\n\\\n**Light & Color**  \\\n- Early/late light; avoid harsh midday unless silhouette is the story.\\\n\\\n**Placement & Cropping**  \\\n- **Lead room** in gaze/motion; don‚Äôt amputate tails/ears.  \\\n- Keep horizon off the head/neck.\\\n\\\n**Common Pitfalls**  \\\nBusy grass/branches merging with face; tiny subject.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\nEye visible and sharp? Clean outline? Behavior readable?\\\n\\\n**Exercises**  \\\nCompose the same animal once environmental, once isolating; compare narrative feel.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Macro\\\n**Intent & Priorities**  \\\nForm and texture; abstraction vs identification.\\\n\\\n**Armature / Flow**  \\\n- **Spiral** around focal detail; **C-curve** cradle; **radial** for flowers.\\\n\\\n**Depth Strategy**  \\\n- Razor-thin DoF‚Äîdecide exactly what is sharp. Focus stack if you need ID clarity.\\\n\\\n**Light & Color**  \\\n- Control speculars; use diffused sources; avoid color cast from surfaces.\\\n\\\n**Placement & Cropping**  \\\n- Don‚Äôt center by default; give negative space to breathe; avoid edge kisses on delicate forms.\\\n\\\n**Common Pitfalls**  \\\nEverything equally crunchy; no focal; background noise.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\nOne crisp focal? Background unobtrusive? Edge discipline held?\\\n\\\n**Exercises**  \\\nShoot the same subject with (A) single crisp edge, (B) full stack; decide which serves intent.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Food & Beverage\\\n**Intent & Priorities**  \\\nAppetite appeal; texture; steam/condensation cues.\\\n\\\n**Armature / Flow**  \\\n- **Triangles** (plate + props); **L-composition** (table edge + prop).  \\\n- **S-curve** for sauces/utensils leading to bite.\\\n\\\n**Depth Strategy**  \\\n- Shallow DoF for hero bite; AO at plate contacts; clean background.\\\n\\\n**Light & Color**  \\\n- Back/side light for texture; control white balance for appetizing warmth.\\\n\\\n**Placement & Cropping**  \\\n- Avoid cropping through the main bite; leave room for type if needed.\\\n\\\n**Common Pitfalls**  \\\nGreasy glare; dead greens; messy crumbs stealing focus.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\nTexture alive?
