# 📘 Layer 2 Power & Systemic Force
---



## 1. Persistence — *What outlives exposure*
**Truth does not interrupt enforcement.**

> Knowing, revealing, or proving does not pause action; enforcement proceeds independently of awareness or legitimacy.

---

## 2. Delegation — *How power acts without exposure*
**Enforcement is outsourced.**

> Force is applied through intermediaries; responsibility is diffuse while outcomes remain intact.

---

## 3. Enforcement — *How threats are neutralized*
**The system isolates threats.**

> Disruption is not destroyed or debated; it is cut off from circulation, relevance, and reach.
