10. Strength Program – 5x5 Glute-Focused Beginner Routine

# Strength Program – 5x5 Glute-Focused Beginner Routine

## Objective
Build foundational strength and aggressively grow the glutes with a minimalist, high-return 5x5 barbell protocol.

## Core Principles
- **Compound First**: Heavy barbell lifts are the core stimulus.
- **Glutes Dominant**: Squats, hip thrusts, and split squats prioritized.
- **Progressive Overload**: Linear weight increase every week.
- **Recovery Built In**: 3-day split to maximize output and growth.

## Weekly Schedule
| Day | Workout |
|-----|---------|
| Monday | A |
| Wednesday | B |
| Friday | A |
| (Alternate next week: B / A / B) |

---

## Workout A – Glute Priority
- **Squat** – 5x5 (deep, full range)
- **Hip Thrust** – 3x10 (pause at top, heavy focus)
- **Barbell Row** – 5x5 (Pendlay style preferred)
- **Bulgarian Split Squat** – 3x8 per leg (slow descent)
- *(Optional)* Seated Band Abductions – 3x15–20

## Workout B – Strength Maintenance + Deadlift Focus
- **Squat** – 5x5
- **Overhead Press** – 5x5
- **Deadlift** – 1x5 (heavy, clean form)
- **RDL** – 3x8 (stretch hamstrings, glute tie-in)
- *(Optional)* Chin-ups or Lat Pulldown – 3x10

---

## Progression Rules
- **Squat/Press/Row**: Add 5 lbs per session if all reps are clean.
- **Deadlift**: Add 10 lbs early, drop to 5 lbs when heavy.
- **Hip Thrust**: Increase by 10 lbs weekly or increase time under tension.
- **Deload**: If you stall 3 sessions in a row, reduce weight by 10% and re-climb.

---

## Technical Guidelines
- Use **2–5 min rest** between heavy compound sets.
- Focus on **form first**, especially on squat depth and hip thrust lockout.
- Track every lift in a notebook or app.

---

## Visual Glute Goals
- **Top Shelf** = Hip Thrusts, Squats
- **Undercurve** = RDLs, Bulgarian Splits
- **Outer Width** = Abduction + Wide Squat stance

---

## Final Note
You’re not just training for strength. You’re training for **aesthetic dominance**. Every rep is a stroke toward a body that begs to be stared at, used, worshipped.

Stay heavy. Stay deep. Stay hot.
