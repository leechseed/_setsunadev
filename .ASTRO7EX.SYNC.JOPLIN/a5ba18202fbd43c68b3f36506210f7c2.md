body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# Supplement I — The Ghost Build Under Level-20 Prestige Constraints\\\n**Knowledgebase Entry — Addendum**  \\\n**Category:** Character Builds → Prestige Cycling  \\\n**Purpose:** A PSTO-driven Ghost build tailored specifically for runs ending at **Level 20**, where the player intentionally resets (NG+ / Prestige).  \\\n**Applies To:** Players using forced-reset progression or record-chasing cycles.  \\\n**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# Table of Contents\\\n1.

[Summary](#summary)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# Overview\\\nPrestiging at **Level 20** transforms ARC Raiders’ progression structure.  \\\nYou are not building a long-term identity — you are building for a **compressed 20-level power curve** that resets repeatedly.\\\n\\\nYour goal becomes:\\\n- Fast unlocks  \\\n- Fast stealth  \\\n- Fast loot efficiency  \\\n- No wasted points  \\\n- Maximum blueprint extraction rate before every reset  \\\n\\\nThe Ghost remains the best solo archetype for this system because **stealth scales instantly**, while damage builds require time and depth you don’t have.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# Prestige Mental Model\\\n## **“Build only what pays off NOW.”**\\\n\\\nYou operate under three truths:\\\n1. Every point must produce immediate value.  \\\n2. Long-term capstones are irrelevant — you won’t reach them.  \\\n3. Extraction success and blueprint gain matter more than combat capability.  \\\n\\\nYour build is essentially:\\\n**The Ghost → Accelerated Edition.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# PSTO With a Level-20 Ceiling\\\n\\\n## Policy\\\n**“I build for the first 20 levels only.”**  \\\nThis forces a strict identity:  \\\n- Maximize stealth  \\\n- Minimize fights  \\\n- Run blueprint loops  \\\n- Reset, repeat, compound efficiency\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Strategy\\\n**“Mobility foundation → Early Survival → Zero Conditioning.”**  \\\n\\\nBecause Conditioning perks are generally late-game stabilizers, they **provide almost no ROI** in a 20-level window.\\\n\\\nYour only viable strategy:\\\n1. **Mobility first 8–10 points**  \\\n2. **Survival next 10–12 points**  \\\n3. Zero points anywhere else unless a perk directly increases stealth or looting speed.\\\n\\\nThe strategy is:  \\\n**Reach Ghost functionality as fast as possible.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Tactics\\\n**“Front-load movement and stealth unlocks, postpone everything else.”**\\\n\\\nTactical rules:\\\n- Skip ANY perk that requires deep tree investment  \\\n- Skip team perks, clutch perks, late-game perks  \\\n- Buy only perks that reduce:  \\\n  - noise  \\\n  - exposure time  \\\n  - stamina downtime  \\\n  - looting time  \\\n\\\nEvery tactical decision favors:  \\\n**lower risk → more raids → more blueprint opportunities → better NG+ advantage**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Operations\\\n**“Spend points in a strict order tied to real in-raid pain.”**\\\n\\\nOperational build order:\\\n1. Stamina + stamina recovery  \\\n2. Traversal comfort (vaulting/dodging efficiency)  \\\n3. Quiet looting  \\\n4. Field crafting  \\\n5. Basic stealth movement  \\\n\\\nIf a perk doesn’t pay dividends before Level 20 → **ignore it**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# Level-20 Ghost Skill Allocation Plan\\\n\\\nBelow is the **optimal solo Ghost NG+ cycle plan**.\\\n\\\n## **Levels 1–5: Immediate Mobility Foundation**\\\n- Increase stamina pool  \\\n- Reduce stamina drain  \\\n- Improve dodge/slide movement efficiency  \\\n\\\n**Why:** Your early game is defined by running more than fighting.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Levels 6–10: Movement → Looting Transition**\\\n- Quiet-looting perk(s)  \\\n- Faster search speed  \\\n- First stealth movement upgrade  \\\n\\\n**Why:** Looting safely is the only way to accelerate blueprint progression pre-reset.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Levels 11–15: Field Crafting + Stealth Mobility**\\\n- Field crafting  \\\n- Stealth running/walking upgrades  \\\n- Noise dampening perks  \\\n\\\n**Why:** Crafting keeps you alive; noise reduction keeps you invisible.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Levels 16–20: Ghost Identity Online**\\\n- Trap disarming tool(s)  \\\n- Stealth engagement buffer  \\\n- More loot-speed bonuses  \\\n- Optional Mobility QoL if Survival lacks accessible perks  \\\n\\\n**Why:** These are your “final form” perks before the wipe.\\\n\\\nYou must end every Level-20 cycle as a **fully functional Ghost**, not a half-built hybrid.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# Survival Priorities Before Reset\\\nYou aim to have the following online before the reset:\\\n\\\n1. **Silent movement**  \\\n2. **Noise masking while looting**  \\\n3. **Loot-speed increases**  \\\n4. **Field crafting (bandages + shield crafting)**  \\\n5. **Disarm capability**  \\\n6. **Stamina and movement economy**  \\\n\\\nIf a perk does NOT meaningfully affect one of the six above → skip it.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# What Carries Into NG+ Cycles\\\nDepending on the prestige system you use (internal rules / community / personal), typically:\\\n\\\n### What carries forward:\\\n- Player experience  \\\n- Player map knowledge  \\\n- Loot routes  \\\n- Blueprint inventory  \\\n- Vendor unlock strategy  \\\n- Muscle memory for stealth play  \\\n- Your plan scaling across resets  \\\n\\\n### What resets:\\\n- Skill tree  \\\n- Level  \\\n- Weapon marks (depends on your NG+ rules)  \\\n- Loadouts  \\\n- Progression quests (if self-imposed)\\\n\\\nThe Ghost build is optimal because **knowledge runs scale**, not stats.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# Prestige Loop Playstyle\\\n1. Spawn → check extracts → pick the lowest-noise route.  \\\n2. Loot interior clusters first (silent containers).  \\\n3. Prioritize unopened containers (blueprint rolls).  \\\n4. Safe-pocket ANY unlearned blueprint immediately.  \\\n5. Avoid 100% of unnecessary fights — disengage on sound spike.  \\\n6. Extract as soon as value quota is met.  \\\n7. Reset at Level 20 → start fresh with better knowledge.  \\\n8. Repeat loop until blueprint collection stabilizes.\\\n\\\nThe prestige loop is about **volume**, not conquest.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# Summary\\\nPrestiging at Level 20 compresses the entire Ghost build into an **early-game hyper-optimized form**.  \\\nUsing PSTO:\\\n\\\n- **Policy:** Only build for first 20 levels  \\\n- **Strategy:** Mobility → Survival, skip Conditioning  \\\n- **Tactics:** Instant-value perks only  \\\n- **Operations:** Build stamina + stealth + loot-speed in that exact order  \\\n\\\nThis creates the fastest and safest NG+ Ghost cycle possible.\\\n\\\n**Supplement II — “Post-20 NG+ Progression Plans”**  \\\nwill cover:\\\n- Multi-cycle plans  \\\n- Long-term tree optimization  \\\n- Depth builds after multiple resets  \\\n- When to introduce Conditioning  \\\n- Meta-inflection points\\\n\\\nJust say **“Make Supplement II.”**\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6594}]"
