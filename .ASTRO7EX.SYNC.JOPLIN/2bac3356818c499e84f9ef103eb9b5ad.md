body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# The Leechseed Manifesto  \\\n## SECTION: Narrative Doctrine  \\\n## TITLE: The 12 Basic Components of Story\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Overview**\\\n\\\nThis doctrine outlines the **12 foundational components** required to construct a fully functional story. Each component operates as an independent structural pillar—no one piece substitutes for another. A story missing any of these is incomplete, unbalanced, or ineffective. These are not tropes or beats. These are the *non-negotiables*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **1. Protagonist**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe primary character through whom the audience experiences the story. They are the center of gravity around which narrative decisions revolve.\\\n\\\n**Requirements**  \\\n- Must have agency: passive protagonists break momentum.  \\\n- Must have a goal or desire.  \\\n- Must face internal or external pressure that forces growth, adaptation, or collapse.\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nThe protagonist is not the hero—they are the decision-maker, the sacrifice-maker, the vessel for transformation.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **2. Antagonist**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe force or entity opposing the protagonist’s goal. This can be a person, institution, environment, or inner demon.\\\n\\\n**Requirements**  \\\n- Must generate meaningful resistance.  \\\n- Should reflect or contrast the protagonist’s values.\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nThe antagonist applies pressure. Without opposition, there is no change, no story—only wandering.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **3. Plot**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe sequence of events that forms the spine of the story. It converts raw character and concept into narrative movement.\\\n\\\n**Core Elements**  \\\n- Inciting Incident  \\\n- Rising Action  \\\n- Climax  \\\n- Falling Action  \\\n- Resolution\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nPlot provides structure. It is *what happens*—not what it means, not how it’s told. A story without plot is a shapeless idea.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **4. Conflict**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe central tension that drives the narrative forward.\\\n\\\n**Types**  \\\n- External: enemy, nature, society, fate  \\\n- Internal: guilt, fear, identity  \\\n- Philosophical: truth vs. illusion, freedom vs. control\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nConflict generates stakes. It forces the protagonist into motion and gives meaning to their decisions.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **5. Goal**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe specific, tangible outcome the protagonist wants.\\\n\\\n**Requirements**  \\\n- Must be clear to the audience.  \\\n- Must be threatened by the conflict.  \\\n- Must carry emotional or moral weight.\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nThe goal drives the plot. Without it, the story has no vector—only drifting scenes.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **6. Setting**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe time, place, and environment where the story unfolds.\\\n\\\n**Layers**  \\\n- Physical (e.g., desert, spaceship)  \\\n- Cultural (e.g., 90s America, alien empire)  \\\n- Psychological (e.g., oppressive, surreal)\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nSetting is not backdrop—it’s pressure. It shapes behavior and enables or obstructs character decisions.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **7. Theme**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe abstract idea or question being explored beneath the surface of the plot.\\\n\\\n**Examples**  \\\n- “Can justice exist without vengeance?”  \\\n- “Does love survive death?”  \\\n- “What is freedom?”\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nTheme gives the story weight. It transforms plot into purpose.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **8. Character Arc**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe internal evolution or devolution of the protagonist.\\\n\\\n**Types**  \\\n- Positive Arc: from broken to whole  \\\n- Negative Arc: from noble to damned  \\\n- Flat Arc: unchanged but a source of change for others\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nThe arc proves theme. It's where consequence becomes character.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **9. Point of View**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe narrative lens through which the audience accesses the story.\\\n\\\n**Forms**  \\\n- First person (“I”)  \\\n- Third person limited (“he/she” with access to one mind)  \\\n- Omniscient (unlimited access)  \\\n- Unreliable (distorted or subjective)\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nPOV controls information, tension, and audience intimacy.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **10. Tone**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe emotional attitude of the narrative.\\\n\\\n**Examples**  \\\n- Cynical  \\\n- Whimsical  \\\n- Tragic  \\\n- Detached  \\\n- Ecstatic\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nTone sets expectations and creates cohesion across scenes.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **11. Style**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe aesthetic texture of the writing—its rhythm, structure, vocabulary, and sensory effect.\\\n\\\n**Components**  \\\n- Sentence construction  \\\n- Word choice  \\\n- Use of metaphor  \\\n- Pacing\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nStyle is how the story feels in the reader’s brain.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **12. Voice**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe distinct narrative presence that emerges from the intersection of diction, worldview, tone, and personality.\\\n\\\n**Sources**  \\\n- The narrator  \\\n- The author  \\\n- The text itself as a constructed presence\\\n\\\n**Function**  \\\nVoice is what makes a story unmistakably yours. It is the fingerprint, the vibe, the soulprint of the narrative.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Final Principle**\\\n\\\n> **All 12 components must exist in tension.**  \\\n> A brilliant plot without theme is hollow. A vivid voice without conflict is self-indulgent.  \\\n> These components are not ingredients. They are structural load-bearers.  \\\n> **Remove one, and the story collapses.**\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5043}]"
