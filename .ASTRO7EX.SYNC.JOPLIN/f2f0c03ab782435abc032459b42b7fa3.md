In Dramatica terms, the Overall Story Throughline centers on **Activity**—not as heroic momentum, but as futile, compulsive motion. Every character is caught in the gears of decaying machinery, performing tasks that no longer serve purpose. The narrative doesn’t depict people failing to act—it shows action as the very means of destruction. In this world, *doing* is decay, and silence is sacrilege.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Core Concept**\\\n- **Activity**: The story’s problems arise from **doing**—from relentless motion, enforcement, and reaction.\\\n- **Function**: Activity isn’t productive; it’s ritualized maintenance of collapse. The story explores the futility of effort in a world past redemption.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Behavioral Traits of the Overall Story**\\\n- **Compulsive Motion**\\\n  - Characters don’t stop moving—but not because they’re progressing.\\\n  - Motion is a reflex: scavenging, scrubbing, enforcing, hiding.\\\n  - Every action delays rot, but deepens it.\\\n\\\n- **Rot as Process, Not Event**\\\n  - Collapse isn’t a bang; it’s maintenance.\\\n  - The more they *do*, the more they enable the system’s long death.\\\n  - Action preserves the illusion of control.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Narrative Infrastructure**\\\n- **Survival as Labor**\\\n  - Every faction, every role, is built on **endless upkeep**.\\\n  - Soldiers enforce. Cleaners cleanse. Prophets prophesy.\\\n  - No one questions the rituals—they just keep performing them.\\\n\\\n- **Decay Is Institutionalized**\\\n  - Rotten structures are shored up instead of razed.\\\n  - The system writes protocols for its own decomposition.\\\n  - Denial is outsourced to procedure.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Conflict Engine**\\\n- **Doing Becomes the Enemy**\\\n  - The more the characters act, the more entangled they become.\\\n  - They do not resist collapse—they rehearse it.\\\n  - Every effort is a loop: enforce → erode → enforce.\\\n\\\n- **Stillness Is Rebellion**\\\n  - To stop is treason.\\\n  - Silence is sacrilege.\\\n  - Inaction is the only meaningful act left.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Impact on the Ensemble**\\\n- **No One Is Immune**\\\n  - Even prophets are workers.\\\n  - Even rebels are rule-followers.\\\n  - Their defiance is labor. Their labor is complicity.\\\n\\\n> “They are not building a future. They are maintaining a corpse.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Climactic Statement**\\\n- **No one slows the rot. They schedule it.**\\\n- **No one escapes collapse. They organize it.**\\\n\\\nIn this story, the apocalypse doesn’t come.  \\\nIt’s rescheduled—*daily*, by hand.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Final Insight**\\\n- **The world is not falling apart because people are doing nothing.**\\\n- **It’s falling apart because they won’t stop doing.**\\\n\\\nThis is not dystopia—it’s **maintenance horror**.\\\n\\\n> *The machine doesn’t run. It grinds.*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Tagline**\\\n**ASTRO7EX** isn’t about heroes fighting the end.  \\\nIt’s about **workers maintaining it**—ritual by ritual, act by act,  \\\nuntil the whole world forgets it ever needed meaning.\\\n\"],[0,\"\\\n\\\n--\"]],\"start1\":4711,\"start2\":4711,\"length1\":477,\"length2\":2985}]"
