## üß† Overview

Vivian‚Äôs relationship with **Myrtle** is the **quietest, most sacred** thread in *ASTRO7EX*. Unlike the procedural terror of the MODS, the seductive delay of Fiona, or the prophetic paralysis of John Smith, **Myrtle simply stays**. She is **faith in stillness**, a figure who witnesses without judging, waits without withdrawing, and speaks only when silence has served its purpose.

Myrtle is not a motivator or obstacle. She is an **emotional axis**‚ÄîVivian‚Äôs last living reference point to **who she was before survival became her only skill**. In storyweaving terms, Myrtle is not exposition, incitement, or twist‚Äîshe is **soul infrastructure**.

## üß± Dramatica Framework

> ‚ÄúThe Sidekick represents unshakable faith‚Äînot in ideas, but in the protagonist themselves.‚Äù
> ‚Äî *Dramatica Theory Book*

| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vivian** | Main Character | Proves meaning is worth choosing despite pain             |
| **Myrtle** | Sidekick       | Holds the emotional ground the world erases around Vivian |

## ‚ú® Establishing the Relationship

> ‚ÄúThe most powerful relationship openings are not built on chemistry, but **witnessing**.‚Äù
> ‚Äî *The First Five Pages*

Myrtle is introduced **post-trauma**, during Vivian‚Äôs recovery from her crew‚Äôs betrayal and the MODS‚Äô silence.

### **First Scene: Faith Without Words**

* Vivian is in a decontamination tank, *dissociating*.
* Myrtle sits nearby, knees drawn up, watching her‚Äînot trying to interrupt. Just *there*.
* Hours pass. Myrtle says one thing:

  > *‚ÄúYou were always going to live. I just had to wait until you remembered that.‚Äù*

Vivian doesn‚Äôt respond. She doesn‚Äôt need to. Myrtle is not offering answers. She‚Äôs **holding space.**

---

## üî• Developing the Relationship

> ‚ÄúRelationships deepen not in the loud moments, but in the quiet ones we don‚Äôt explain.‚Äù
> ‚Äî *Writing Deep Scenes*

The core of their development lies in Myrtle‚Äôs **constancy**. As Vivian breaks down, lashes out, gets seduced, gets hunted‚Äî**Myrtle doesn‚Äôt leave**.

### **Key Scenes of Development**

* **Scene 1**:
  Vivian panics after unlocking a corrupted memory fragment. Myrtle sits beside her. Doesn‚Äôt speak. Just lets her scream, then holds her when it‚Äôs over.

* **Scene 2**:
  Myrtle sneaks a joke into a mission briefing. Vivian doesn‚Äôt laugh‚Äîbut *doesn‚Äôt leave*.

  * Myrtle:

    > *‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I know you‚Äôre still in there.‚Äù*

* **Scene 3**:
  Vivian nearly gives up. Myrtle doesn‚Äôt argue. She simply opens a datachip of Vivian‚Äôs childhood training footage‚Äîthe one Vivian thought she deleted.

  > *‚ÄúEven back then, you were trying to protect something.‚Äù*

Myrtle‚Äôs role is *not to inspire*. It‚Äôs to **recognize**. And that recognition becomes Vivian‚Äôs deepest strength.

---

## üß® Resolving the Relationship

> ‚ÄúThe resolution of a faithful relationship is not betrayal or triumph‚Äîit is **presence at the precipice**.‚Äù
> ‚Äî *Hooked*

Myrtle‚Äôs final contribution is subtle‚Äîand devastating.

### **Final Scene**

* Vivian prepares to enter the final chamber to disable the DHR countdown.
* Myrtle does not stop her. Does not wish her luck.
* She clips a locket to Vivian‚Äôs wrist‚Äîthe last memory fragment Myrtle extracted from the crew‚Äôs neural remains.

> *‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need it. But I know you‚Äôd want to know they were with you.‚Äù*

Vivian nods.

Leaves.

Myrtle doesn‚Äôt follow.

### **Emotional Resolution**

* Myrtle‚Äôs faith is proven‚Äînot because she ‚Äúhelped‚Äù Vivian win, but because **she stayed without needing to be right**.
* The relationship resolves not in climax, but **completion**.
  Myrtle remains the **still point** Vivian uses to find her way back to herself.

## üìñ Literary & Mythic Support

### **Joseph Campbell ‚Äì The Companion Soul**

* Myrtle is **not the mentor**, nor the goddess, nor the temptress.
* She is **the tether**. The one who doesn‚Äôt leave the threshold.
* In mythic terms, she is the personification of ‚Äúthe self that waits.‚Äù

### **Late 2000s Sci-Fi Archetypes**

* **Yuki Nagato (Haruhi)** meets **Gowther (Seven Deadly Sins)** meets **GHOST Re-L Proxy**:
