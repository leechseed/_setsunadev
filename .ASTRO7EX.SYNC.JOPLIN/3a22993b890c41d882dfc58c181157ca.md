Unlike the procedural terror of the MODS, the seductive delay of Fiona, or the prophetic paralysis of John Smith, **Myrtle simply stays**. She is **faith in stillness**, a figure who witnesses without judging, waits without withdrawing, and speaks only when silence has served its purpose.\\\n\\\nMyrtle is not a motivator or obstacle. She is an **emotional axis**‚ÄîVivian‚Äôs last living reference point to **who she was before survival became her only skill**. In storyweaving terms, Myrtle is not exposition, incitement, or twist‚Äîshe is **soul infrastructure**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üß± Dramatica Framework\\\n\\\n> ‚ÄúThe Sidekick represents unshakable faith‚Äînot in ideas, but in the protagonist themselves.‚Äù\\\n> ‚Äî *Dramatica Theory Book*\\\n\\\n### **Functional Roles**\\\n\\\n| Character  | Function       | Purpose                                                   |\\\n| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\\\n| **Vivian** | Main Character | Proves meaning is worth choosing despite pain             |\\\n| **Myrtle** | Sidekick       | Holds the emotional ground the world erases around Vivian |\\\n\\\n### **Key Dramatica Elements**\\\n\\\n* **Myrtle‚Äôs Motivation**: *Faith, Support, Feeling*\\\n* **Myrtle‚Äôs Methodology**: *Reduction, Reevaluation, Deduction*\\\n* **Vivian‚Äôs Drive**: To act with meaning.\\\n* **Myrtle‚Äôs Function**: *To remind Vivian that she is already enough.*\\\n\\\nMyrtle is **Vivian‚Äôs internal sanctuary personified**‚Äîa sidekick not of action, but of *soul continuity*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ‚ú® Establishing the Relationship\\\n\\\n> ‚ÄúThe most powerful relationship openings are not built on chemistry, but **witnessing**.‚Äù\\\n> ‚Äî *The First Five Pages*\\\n\\\nMyrtle is introduced **post-trauma**, during Vivian‚Äôs recovery from her crew‚Äôs betrayal and the MODS‚Äô silence.\\\n\\\n### **First Scene: Faith Without Words**\\\n\\\n* Vivian is in a decontamination tank, *dissociating*.\\\n* Myrtle sits nearby, knees drawn up, watching her‚Äînot trying to interrupt. Just *there*.\\\n* Hours pass. Myrtle says one thing:\\\n\\\n  > *‚ÄúYou were always going to live. I just had to wait until you remembered that.‚Äù*\\\n\\\nVivian doesn‚Äôt respond. She doesn‚Äôt need to. Myrtle is not offering answers. She‚Äôs **holding space.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üî• Developing the Relationship\\\n\\\n> ‚ÄúRelationships deepen not in the loud moments, but in the quiet ones we don‚Äôt explain.‚Äù\\\n> ‚Äî *Writing Deep Scenes*\\\n\\\nThe core of their development lies in Myrtle‚Äôs **constancy**. As Vivian breaks down, lashes out, gets seduced, gets hunted‚Äî**Myrtle doesn‚Äôt leave**.\\\n\\\n### **Key Scenes of Development**\\\n\\\n* **Scene 1**:\\\n  Vivian panics after unlocking a corrupted memory fragment. Myrtle sits beside her. Doesn‚Äôt speak. Just lets her scream, then holds her when it‚Äôs over.\\\n\\\n* **Scene 2**:\\\n  Myrtle sneaks a joke into a mission briefing. Vivian doesn‚Äôt laugh‚Äîbut *doesn‚Äôt leave*.\\\n\\\n  * Myrtle:\\\n\\\n    > *‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I know you‚Äôre still in there.‚Äù*\\\n\\\n* **Scene 3**:\\\n  Vivian nearly gives up. Myrtle doesn‚Äôt argue. She simply opens a datachip of Vivian‚Äôs childhood training footage‚Äîthe one Vivian thought she deleted.\\\n\\\n  > *‚ÄúEven back then, you were trying to protect something.‚Äù*\\\n\\\nMyrtle‚Äôs role is *not to inspire*. It‚Äôs to **recognize**. And that recognition becomes Vivian‚Äôs deepest strength.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üß® Resolving the Relationship\\\n\\\n> ‚ÄúThe resolution of a faithful relationship is not betrayal or triumph‚Äîit is **presence at the precipice**.‚Äù\\\n> ‚Äî *Hooked*\\\n\\\nMyrtle‚Äôs final contribution is subtle‚Äîand devastating.\\\n\\\n### **Final Scene**\\\n\\\n* Vivian prepares to enter the final chamber to disable the DHR countdown.\\\n* Myrtle does not stop her. Does not wish her luck.\\\n* She clips a locket to Vivian‚Äôs wrist‚Äîthe last memory fragment Myrtle extracted from the crew‚Äôs neural remains.\\\n\\\n> *‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need it. But I know you‚Äôd want to know they were with you.‚Äù*\\\n\\\nVivian nods.\\\n\\\nLeaves.\\\n\\\nMyrtle doesn‚Äôt follow.\\\n\\\n### **Emotional Resolution**\\\n\\\n* Myrtle‚Äôs faith is proven‚Äînot because she ‚Äúhelped‚Äù Vivian win, but because **she stayed without needing to be right**.\\\n* The relationship resolves not in climax, but **completion**.\\\n  Myrtle remains the **still point** Vivian uses to find her way back to herself.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üìñ Literary & Mythic Support\\\n\\\n### **Harold Bloom ‚Äì The Witness Figure**\\\n\\\n* Myrtle functions like **Ishmael in *Moby-Dick*** or **Nick Carraway in *Gatsby***‚Äînot the doer, but the **truth holder**.\\\n* She exists to **preserve what‚Äôs real in the protagonist**, even if the protagonist cannot.\\\n\\\n### **Joseph Campbell ‚Äì The Companion Soul**\\\n\\\n* Myrtle is **not the mentor**, nor the goddess, nor the temptress.\\\n* She is **the tether**. The one who doesn‚Äôt leave the threshold.\\\n* In mythic terms, she is the personification of ‚Äúthe self that waits.‚Äù\\\n\\\n### **Late 2000s Sci-Fi Archetypes**\\\n\\\n* **Yuki Nagato (Haruhi)** meets **Gowther (Seven Deadly Sins)** meets **GHOST Re-L Proxy**:\\\n\\\n  * Soft-spoken AI/mystic observer girls who say little, but shape everything through faith, presence, and interpretive precision.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üåå Narrative Astrology Relationship Chart\\\n\\\n### **Vivian + Myrtle Composite Chart**\\\n\\\n| Aspect                    | Meaning                                                 |\\\n| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\\\n| **Moon Trine Mercury**    | Safe emotional communication.

They don‚Äôt argue.\\\nThey **witness each other.**\\\n\\\nMyrtle enters when everyone else has abandoned Vivian. She stays when others manipulate, seduce, or analyze. She offers **nothing except presence**‚Äîand that becomes everything.\\\n\\\nTheir bond is not healed. It was never broken. It is simply remembered.\\\nMyrtle is not proof that Vivian is loved‚Äîshe is proof that **Vivian never stopped being lovable**.\\\n\\\n> ‚ÄúEveryone else wants to fix her.\\\n> Myrtle just lets her be.‚Äù\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ‚úÖ Status: Vivian‚ÄìMyrtle Storyweaving Sequence Complete\\\n\\\n**Next Step**: Begin storyweaving for Nacho or The Committee.\\\n`#astro7ex` `#storyweaving` `#vivianxmyrtle` `#sidekick` `#emotionalanchor`\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":7441}]"
