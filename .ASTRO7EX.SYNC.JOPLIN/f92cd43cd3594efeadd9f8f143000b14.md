FUTURE FABULA	

100 years after the events of ASTRO7EX

SPACE RANGERS travel vast distances to old, isolated, and forgotten towns and outposts. They encounter wayward pioneers, mining outfits, and outlaws. They are the only beacon of hope, order, and peace far from the nearest judge, jury, and sheriff. Often, when a call can be answered, they must act in place of all three.
