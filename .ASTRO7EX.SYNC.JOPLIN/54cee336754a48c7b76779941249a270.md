PROLOGUE STORYFORM - EPISODE 2 

	# PROLOGUE STORYFORM — EPISODE 2
**Working Title:** The Ancient Wallet Job  
**Function:** Shift from situation to *manipulation & planning*, introduce MODS as the standing IC force, and light the countdown that Ep. 3 must execute against.

## Story Dynamics
- **Driver:** Action → MODS protocols hit first; choices follow
- **Limit:** Timelock → DHR ping initializes a silent countdown
- **Outcome:** Success → the plan is conceived and the lead secured
- **Judgment:** Bad → personal cost deepens; trust corrodes
- **MC Resolve/Growth/Approach/Style:** Steadfast • Stop • Do-er • Linear

## Throughlines

### Overall Story (OS)
- **Domain:** Psychology (Manipulation)
- **Concern:** Conceptualizing (engineering the heist schema)
- **Issue:** State of Being vs. Sense of Self
- **Problem / Solution:** **Avoid** → **Pursuit**
- **Symptom / Response:** **Support** ↔ **Oppose**
- **Goal:** Design a viable plan to recover the ancient bitcoin wallet
- **Consequence:** Being co-opted into MODS compliance protocols
- **Requirements:** Secure access routes; procure analog failsafes
- **Forewarnings:** Prototype plans keep collapsing under surveillance
- **Catalyst / Inhibitor:** Responsibility / Commitment
- **Benchmark:** Becoming (crew “becomes” criminals or martyrs)

### Main Character (MC) — *Vivian*
- **Domain:** Universe (Situation) — outlawed, resource-strapped exile
- **Concern:** Present (today’s scarcity and exposure)
- **Issue:** Openness vs. Prejudice
- **Problem / Solution:** **Uncontrolled** → **Control**
- **Unique Ability:** Approach (decisive strikes)
- **Critical Flaw:** Attitude (contempt that burns bridges)

### Impact Character (IC) — *MODS* (the System)
- **Domain:** Mind (Fixed Attitude) — encoded refusal to change
- **Concern:** Memory (immutable records; protocol over truth)
- **Issue:** Closure vs. Denial
- **Problem / Solution:** **Non-Accurate** → **Accurate**  
  *(their brittle “exactness” exposes itself when reality doesn't fit)*
- **IC Function:** Impose static definitions; nullify her premises

### Relationship (RS) — *Vivian ↔ MODS*
- **Domain:** Physics (Activity)
- **Concern:** Obtaining (access, keys, clearance)
- **Issue:** Morality vs. Self-Interest
- **Problem / Solution:** **Hinder** → **Help**
- **Benchmark:** Doing (workarounds, analog rituals, dirty ops)

## Plot Progressions (Signposts → brief beats)

### OS (Psychology / Conceptualizing)
1. **Conceiving:** Rumor of the ancient wallet resurfaces  
2. **Being:** Crew adopt false roles; social engineering runs  
3. **Becoming:** Masks stick; lines blur; temptation rises  
4. **Conceptualizing:** The final heist design “clicks” under pressure

### MC (Universe)
1. **Past:** Debrief of what the purge cost  
2. **Progress:** Scavenging improves…then a setback  
3. **Present:** Pinpoint the live window before DHR trips  
4. **Future:** Choose to risk everything on the plan

### IC (Mind)
1. **Memory:** MODS cites immutable logs to deny access  
2. **Conscious:** Their “concerns” are policy flags, not ethics  
3. **Preconscious:** Automated blocks trigger without debate  
4. **Subconscious:** Their bedrock motive is stasis, not safety

### RS (Physics)
1. **Learning:** She maps how to “talk” around protocols  
2. **Understanding:** Realizes silence is their weapon  
3. **Doing:** She builds an analog ritual to bypass them  
4. **Obtaining:** First shard of access secured

## Bridge to Ep. 3
- Flips the series into **OS: Physics** with a live **heist-in-motion**.
- Hard-introduces **MODS as the standing IC** that Ep. 3 will fully oppose.
- Starts the **DHR countdown**—Ep. 3 must *act* under **Understanding/Conditioning** pressure.
