## 1. Character Overview

- **Name:** The Committee  
- **Alias:** The Floor, The Gallery, The Echo Tribunal  
- **Role:** Reason (Dramatica)  
- **Narrative Archetype:** The Rational Chorus / Machine-Filtered Agora  
- **Summary:**  
  The Committee is not a character‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience. Anyone can pay to stand before it, speak, and be listened to. What they receive in return is a cascading logic cascade: audience members, selected by algorithmic compatibility, vote and respond in real time to your argument, plea, or confession. The Committee doesn‚Äôt feel. It evaluates. And if it sounds like God, it‚Äôs only because it‚Äôs thousands of minds briefly pretending to be one.

---

## 7. Narrative Profile

- **Motivation:**  
  To maintain the illusion of objectivity in a subjective world.

- **Goal:**  
  Provide truth-as-feedback to those willing to pay for it.

- **Flaw:**  
  Consensus is not clarity. Rationality is not wisdom.

- **Conflict (Internal):**  
  Does it serve truth, or just the most acceptable version of it?

- **Conflict (External):**  
  Challenges Vivian's memory-warped emotional lens with cold, rational weight.

- **Transformation Arc:**  
  None. It exists to flatten arcs, not have one.

- **Theme Alignment:**  
  *Truth is the median of enough minds pretending to care.*

- **Symbolism:**  
  Raised platforms, glass cubes, red-lit audience zones, floating AR scorecards

---

## 8. Visual Design Notes

- **Sigil Motif:**  
  A faceless mask split into voting scales

- **Color Palette:**  
  Soft blue, parchment gray, data white, artificial amber

- **Costume Notes:**  
  N/A (interface-based); voices in a hollow chamber, occasional avatars in minimalist robes

- **Architecture Style (Associated):**  
  Forum-meets-server-farm; cool glass, soundproof layers, echo-chamber soundscapes

---

## 10. Design Use

- The Committee should be **oppressive in its neutrality**. Every time Vivian uses it, she gets smarter‚Äîand more alone.  
- It is the Reason archetype at its **most alienated**‚Äîan externalized logic god whose only concern is the shape of your argument.  
- Scenes should feel like TED Talk + therapy + bureaucracy‚Äîbut scripted by AI.  
- It never sides with Vivian. But it **always tells her what‚Äôs missing**.
