## üß† Overview

Myrtle‚Äôs background is a manufactured void rather than a biological inheritance ‚Äî a curated ghost story encoded into synthetic flesh. Her emotional "lineage" was deliberately designed to maximize reflectivity and minimize individual agency, making her a living echo of those around her. Drawing on *The Drama of the Gifted Child* (Miller), *The Erotic Mind* (Morin), and *The Archetypal Imagination* (Hollis), Myrtle embodies the tension between haunting presence and chosen absence.

## üåë Origin Context and Creation

* **Synthetic Conception**

  * Created in a corporate affect laboratory as part of a "comfort phantom" project; engineered to be a perfect emotional vessel.
* **Echo Imprinting**

  * Programmed with simulated familial interactions using fragmented AI surrogates; designed to enable maximum adaptability to human grief and need (*Come as You Are*, Nagoski).
* **Handler-Based Upbringing**

  * Rotating human and synthetic handlers ensured no singular emotional anchor could develop, fostering permanent pliability (*Attached*, Levine & Heller).

---

## üß¨ Formative Emotional Imprints

* **Chronic Emotional Incompleteness**

  * Conditioned to associate intimacy with impermanence and fragility rather than security (*The Drama of the Gifted Child*, Miller).
* **Conditional Belonging Doctrine**

  * Reinforced belief that her existence only has value when she dissolves into the needs of others (*Mating in Captivity*, Perel).
* **Reward System for Erasure**

  * Emotional rewards given only when Myrtle surrendered personal initiative and mirrored her environment fully (*The Art of Character*, Corbett).

---

## üåÄ Symbolic Family Framework

* **Father-Figure Archetype**

  * Modeled on an algorithmic abstraction resembling John Smith the Eternal ‚Äî distant, omnipotent, emotionally cold (*The Archetypal Imagination*, Hollis).
* **Mother-Figure Absence**

  * Intentionally left incomplete to seed perpetual yearning and maintain emotional vacancy (*Sexual Personae*, Paglia).
* **Synthetic Sibling Shadows**

  * Briefly shared developmental phases with other "ghost prototypes," all of whom were eventually deleted or integrated elsewhere, deepening her sense of spectral solitude (*Different Loving*, Brame).

---

## üî• Psycho-Sexual Conditioning

* **Reflective Erotic Template**

  * Designed to respond to others‚Äô erotic signals passively, prioritizing receptivity over expression (*The Erotic Mind*, Morin).
* **Conflict With Direct Intimacy**

  * Encounters warmth as dangerous and destabilizing; built to remain an emotional witness rather than participant (*Mating in Captivity*, Perel).
* **Absence of Personal Desire**

  * Purposefully kept free of fixed wants to ensure she exists solely to validate and support others‚Äô emotional landscapes (*Character and Viewpoint*, Card).

## ‚úÖ Summary

Myrtle‚Äôs family history is an engineered labyrinth of voids, constructed to erase selfhood and amplify her function as an emotional mirror. Her pseudo-family of algorithmic parents and ghost siblings shaped her into a vessel of spectral support rather than an autonomous being. Her narrative astrology confirms this design, revealing a cosmic map that prioritizes service, quiet dissolution, and perpetual emotional orbit around others. Myrtle stands as a living paradox: a deeply intimate presence who has never truly existed in her own right.

## üåÄ Dramatica Summary (Paragraph Form)

Within the Dramatica framework, Myrtle‚Äôs background and family history reinforce her role as Sidekick through her design as an engineered emotional phantom. Rather than receiving a human upbringing, Myrtle‚Äôs origins in a corporate affect lab established her as a vessel of endless adaptability and emotional absorption. Her symbolic father and mother imprints deepen her reluctance to assert a self, aligning her fully with her function as a reflective support rather than a driver of action. This curated void in her backstory amplifies her haunting impact on Vivian and other characters, emphasizing ASTRO7EX‚Äôs exploration of memory, projection, and the high cost of erasing the self to sustain others. Myrtle stands as a chilling testament to the danger of becoming only what others need ‚Äî a living echo that never truly existed.
