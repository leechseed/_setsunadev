Wicked problems arise from a mismatch between thinking and reality.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: \\\"Wicked problems result from the mismatch\\\"`\\\n\\\n2. Systems thinking is fundamentally about **thinking**, not tools.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"systems is an adjective describing the noun, thinking\\\"`\\\n\\\n3. Complex systems are governed by **simple rules**.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"underneath complex things are simple rules\\\"`\\\n\\\n4. DSRP are the four universal rules of systems thinking.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: \\\"Four Simple Rules of Systems Thinking\\\"`\\\n\\\n5. Mental models mediate all interaction with reality.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"Everything we think is a mental model\\\"`\\\n\\\n6. Feedback aligns or invalidates mental models.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"the real world gives us feedback\\\"`\\\n\\\n7. Systems thinking itself is a complex adaptive system.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"SYSTEMS THINKING IS A COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEM\\\"`\\\n\\\n8. Systems thinking must be democratized to work.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: \\\"we need better citizens who think systemically\\\"`\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## PSTO — Policy / Strategy / Tactics / Operations\\\n\\\n### Policy\\\n- Human survival and problem-solving depend on improving thinking quality.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: \\\"To save our planet... we need better citizens\\\"`\\\n\\\n### Strategy\\\n- Teach universal cognitive rules instead of specialized tools.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"we confuse tools for skills\\\"`\\\n\\\n### Tactics\\\n- Use visual mapping to externalize thinking.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Second Edition Note :: \\\"visual grammar for human thought processes\\\"`\\\n\\\n### Operations\\\n- Apply DSRP repeatedly in daily reasoning and problem-solving.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: \\\"there is no substitute for daily practice\\\"`\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## OODA — Observe / Orient / Decide / Act\\\n\\\n### Observe\\\n- Notice mismatches between expectation and outcome.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"Whenever the behavior of a system surprises us\\\"`\\\n\\\n### Orient\\\n- Examine mental models shaping perception.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"We understand the real world through mental models\\\"`\\\n\\\n### Decide\\\n- Revise or replace models based on feedback.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"this feedback helps us adapt\\\"`\\\n\\\n### Act\\\n- Test revised models in the real world.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"we try it out in the real world\\\"`\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## DSRP — Distinctions / Systems / Relationships / Perspectives\\\n\\\n### Distinctions\\\n- Any idea can be separated from what it is not.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: \\\"DISTINCTIONS RULE\\\"`\\\n\\\n### Systems\\\n- Any idea can be decomposed into parts or wholes.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: \\\"SYSTEMS RULE\\\"`\\\n\\\n### Relationships\\\n- Any idea can relate to other ideas.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: \\\"RELATIONSHIP RULE\\\"`\\\n\\\n### Perspectives\\\n- Any idea can be viewed from a point of view.  \\\n  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: \\\"PERSPECTIVES RULE\\\"`\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Core Concepts (≤30)\\\n\\\n1. **Wicked Problems** — Problems characterized by complexity and disagreement.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: \\\"Wicked Problems involve\\\"`\\\n\\\n2. **Mental Model** — A representation of reality used to guide action.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"Everything we think is a mental model\\\"`\\\n\\\n3. **Feedback** — Information from reality that validates or refutes models.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"the real world gives us feedback\\\"`\\\n\\\n4. **Complex Adaptive System (CAS)** — A system that adapts through feedback.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"Complex Adaptive System (CAS)\\\"`\\\n\\\n5. **Systems Thinking v1.0** — Tool-focused, pluralistic phase.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"systems thinking version 1.0\\\"`\\\n\\\n6. **Systems Thinking v2.0** — Cognition-centered, rule-based phase.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: \\\"systems thinking v2.0\\\"`\\\n\\\n7. **Democratization** — Broad accessibility of systems thinking.  \\\n   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: \\\"Systems thinking belongs to the people\\\"`\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Mental Models (≤12)\\\n\\\n### Mental Model ↔ Reality Feedback Loop\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6730}]"
