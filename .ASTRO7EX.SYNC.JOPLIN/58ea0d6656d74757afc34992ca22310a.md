If there‚Äôs no loop, add a blocker.  \\\n- Validate flow using **blur**, **grayscale**, and **flip** tests before you polish.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## The Guidance Stack (Top-Down Rules)\\\n\\\n1. **Value contrast** decides the first read.  \\\n2. **Edge sharpness** locks the focal; softness elsewhere keeps attention from leaking.  \\\n3. **Vectors** (lines, gaze, gesture) decide **direction**.  \\\n4. **Color & saturation** are tie-breakers and accents, not the engine.  \\\n5. **Framing & blockers** keep the eye **inside** the composition.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Techniques ‚Äî Build the Path\\\n\\\n### 4.1 Leading Lines (Explicit & Implied)\\\n**What**  \\\nUse real or implied lines to steer the eye **toward** your subject.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Align roads, rails, beams, rivers, shorelines **into** the focal.  \\\n- Bend lines slightly so they **curve inward** rather than shoot out.  \\\n- Stack 2‚Äì3 lines that converge at the focal‚Äôs **value-contrast hotspot**.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If lines point out, add a **blocker** or re-angle so the last segment points in.  \\\n- If lines overpower the subject, **soften edges** and drop contrast on the lines as they approach borders.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Do the lines terminate on the subject, not past it?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.2 Gaze & Gesture Vectors\\\n**What**  \\\nHuman eyes follow where faces look and where hands/weapons point.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Aim gazes **at** or **near** the focal, not off-frame.  \\\n- Tilt heads or hands a few degrees to intercept the focal‚Äôs silhouette.  \\\n- Use **counter-gazes** sparingly to create loops (A looks to B, B looks back to A).\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If a character looks off-frame, add a **secondary subject** there or rotate the head/eyes.  \\\n- Avoid ‚Äústaring into the border‚Äù unless you want exit tension.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Can you trace a **conversation triangle** of gazes that lands on the focal?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.3 Contrast Pathways (Value & Edge Hierarchy)\\\n**What**  \\\nDesign a **value gradient** and **edge plan** that lead to the focal.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Put the **largest value jump** on the focal.  \\\n- Build a **gradient** (bright ‚Üí mid ‚Üí dark, or vice versa) that flows toward it.  \\\n- Keep **hardest edges** at the focal; use **lost/soft edges** elsewhere to de-emphasize.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If background competes, compress its values (mid-key) and soften edges.  \\\n- Add a subtle **rim light** to clarify silhouette only where needed.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- In grayscale **blur**, does the path brighten toward the focal?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.4 Color & Temperature Pathways\\\n**What**  \\\nWarm, saturated accents pull; cool, desaturated fields recede.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Reserve the warmest, most saturated color for the focal or stepping stones to it.  \\\n- Use a **temperature gradient** (cool field ‚Üí warm focal) to lure the eye.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If color noise distracts, unify the scene with a cooler wash and **lift saturation** only at the focal.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Is the color story a **single road** (not ten roads) to the subject?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.5 Detail/Sharpness Gradients\\\n**What**  \\\nMicro-contrast, texture, and sharpness act like magnets.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Highest **micro-contrast** and **texture** on the focal; simplify elsewhere.  \\\n- Use DoF to blur foreground/background; keep the focal in the sharp **slice**.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If the eye ping-pongs, blur or reduce texture in the offenders; sharpen only key contours at the focal.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Are the **five sharpest edges** clustered around the subject?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.6 Negative Space Shaping\\\n**What**  \\\nDeliberate emptiness that funnels attention.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Carve clean **gaps** that point toward the focal (arrow-shaped voids).  \\\n- Use asymmetrical negative space to push the eye across the frame.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If it feels empty-stupid, plant a **small stepping stone** near the focal‚Äôs approach vector.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Does the empty shape **aim** at the subject?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.7 Framing Devices (Windows, Tunnels, Vignettes)\\\n**What**  \\\nPut the subject **inside** a frame: windows, arches, foliage, shadow tunnels, vignettes.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Keep inner frame edges **darker/softer** than the subject.  \\\n- Use **tunnel perspective** (darker edges ‚Üí brighter center).\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If the frame steals attention, reduce its contrast/texture; let the **inside** win.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Is the subject clearly **inside** the frame, not merging with it?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.8 Perspective & Convergence (Horizon, Vanishing Points)\\\n**What**  \\\nLines that **converge** at vanishing points drag the eye.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Place vanishing vectors so they converge **on or near** the focal.  \\\n- Keep horizon away from heads; avoid ‚Äúspearing‚Äù the subject with horizon lines.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If convergence misses the focal, shift camera position or **nudge the focal** onto the convergence fan.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Do major convergences **land** at the subject or its immediate neighborhood?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.9 Patterns, Rhythm & Repetition\\\n**What**  \\\nRepeat shapes/intervals to create a **beat** that steps the eye forward.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Use **progression** (big ‚Üí medium ‚Üí small) oriented toward the focal.  \\\n- Break perfect regularity; a slight irregularity **points** the way.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If pattern is too strong, interrupt it near the focal (gap, color switch, orientation flip).\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Can you ‚Äútap‚Äù the rhythm into the focal without getting stuck?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.10 Gateways, Blockers & Edge Control\\\n**What**  \\\nArchitect the **entry**, **path**, and **no-exit** logic.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- **Gateway**: bright/contrasty opening inside the border where the eye naturally enters.  \\\n- **Blockers**: dark masses or strong oblique edges near corners to bounce the eye back.  \\\n- **Edge diet**: soften and darken **borders** unless needed for tension.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If the eye leaks, add a shadow mass, rotate a prop to form a **return arrow**, or crop tighter.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Do corners feel like **turnstiles**, not holes?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.11 Light as a Guide (Chiaroscuro & Falloff)\\\n**What**  \\\nLight direction and **falloff** create luminous paths.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Aim key light so brightest planes **lead to** the subject.  \\\n- Use **falloff** so light fades **away** from exits, brighter near the focal.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If a background hotspot steals attention, lower it or shift it behind the focal as a **halo**.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Does the light **climb** toward the subject rather than away?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.12 Motion Guidance (Blur, Panning, Trails)\\\n**What**  \\\nMovement vectors teach the eye what to chase.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- **Shutter drag** to blur backgrounds while panning with the subject (sharp subject, streaked world ‚Üí eye sticks to subject).  \\\n- **Light trails** and **directional blur** that point at the focal.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If everything blurs equally, the eye has no anchor‚Äîkeep **one crisp island** at the focal.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Is there **one** crisp target amid motion?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.13 Text, Symbols & ‚ÄúHot‚Äù Elements\\\n**What**  \\\nFaces, eyes, readable text, arrows, logos‚Äîthe brain prioritizes them.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Place text/faces **near** the focal or on the route to it.  \\\n- Don‚Äôt scatter ‚Äúhot‚Äù items; group them to **reinforce** the path.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- If text steals the show, downweight it (smaller, lighter value) or move it to a **stepping-stone** position.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Do hot elements **serve** the focal, not compete with it?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Diagnostics & Stress Tests\\\n\\\n- **1-Second Read** ‚Üí Glance and say the subject. If you can‚Äôt, your path is broken.  \\\n- **Blur Test (10‚Äì20 px)** ‚Üí Should still see the route brighten toward the focal.  \\\n- **Grayscale Toggle** ‚Üí If color was doing all the work, your values are weak.  \\\n- **Arrow Pass** ‚Üí Draw arrows over every vector. Any arrows pointing **out**? Fix them.  \\\n- **Border Patrol** ‚Üí Hide the center; evaluate corners: are they pulling? Add blockers or soften.  \\\n- **Edge Count** ‚Üí Mark the 5 sharpest edges. They should cluster at the focal.  \\\n- **Flip Test** ‚Üí Horizontal flip; exits reveal themselves instantly.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Exercises That Build Skill Fast\\\n\\\n1. **Vector Map Drill**  \\\n   - Print a piece; overlay arrows for gaze, lines, light, and edges. Remove or rotate any outward arrow.\\\n\\\n2. **Three-Route Challenge**  \\\n   - Compose the same scene three ways: (A) line-driven, (B) value-driven, (C) light-driven. Compare grayscale blurs.\\\n\\\n3. **Blocker Lab**  \\\n   - Start with a leaky frame; stop leaks using only shape placement and edge softness. No cropping.\\\n\\\n4. **Gradient Walk**  \\\n   - Paint a value gradient that ‚Äúwalks‚Äù the eye across the frame to a focal; add edges only at the end.\\\n\\\n5. **DoF Island**  \\\n   - With camera or paint, create **one sharp island** (subject) in a sea of blur that still explains context.\\\n\\\n6. **Gaze Triangle**  \\\n   - Pose three figures so a gaze triangle loops viewers repeatedly through the focal.\\\n\\\n7. **Light Path**  \\\n   - Arrange light sources so brightest planes step toward the subject; dim the rest.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)\\\n\\\n- **Leading Lines to Nowhere** ‚Üí They must terminate on the subject. *Cure*: redirect line ends or move subject.  \\\n- **Hot Corners** ‚Üí Bright/sharp corners suck viewers out. *Cure*: blockers, vignettes, or value compression.  \\\n- **Equal Sharpness Everywhere** ‚Üí Ping-pong eye. *Cure*: edge hierarchy‚Äîhard at focal only.  \\\n- **Color Noise** ‚Üí Random accents everywhere. *Cure*: unify palette; isolate warm/sat near focal.  \\\n- **Horizon Through Heads** ‚Üí Accidental spears. *Cure*: raise/lower horizon; protect silhouettes.  \\\n- **Ambiguous Figure‚ÄìGround** ‚Üí Subject blends. *Cure*: value separation and clean silhouette first.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Workflow & Setup (Overlays, Apps, Camera/Lens Choices)\\\n\\\n- **Overlays**: Keep PNGs for **arrows**, **vignettes**, **tunnels**, and **gradient bars** you can drop on top while designing.  \\\n- **Photoshop/Krita**:  \\\n  - Make a ‚ÄúFlow‚Äù layer group (arrows, blockers, vignettes).  \\\n  - Use **Gradient Map** adjustments to test value paths quickly.  \\\n- **Procreate**:  \\\n  - Drawing Guide + imported arrow overlays; toggle **Gaussian Blur** for fast blur tests.  \\\n- **Cameras**:  \\\n  - Enable **grid** and **level**; assign a custom button for **AF point** selection to keep the focal sharp.  \\\n  - **Lens choice**:  \\\n    - **Wide** exaggerates leading lines; great for tunnels/foreground anchors.  \\\n    - **Tele** compresses and stacks shapes; great for gaze/gesture alignment.  \\\n  - **Shutter/DoF**: Use slower shutter for trails; wider aperture for **sharpness islands**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Cheat Sheet Summary\\\n\\\n- Start with **value path**, lock with **edge hierarchy**, steer with **vectors**.  \\\n- Create **entry ‚Üí focal ‚Üí secondary ‚Üí loop-back**; add **blockers** at exits.  \\\n- Warm/saturated accents are **seasoning**, not the meal.  \\\n- Keep **five sharpest edges** at the focal; soften borders.  \\\n- If in doubt: **blur + grayscale + flip**. Fix whatever fails those tests.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Extended Glossary\\\n\\\n- **Arrow Pass** ‚Üí A markup step where you literally draw arrows over every directional cue to audit flow.  \\\n- **Blocker** ‚Üí A dark/soft mass or angled edge at borders that prevents eye exit and redirects inward.  \\\n- **Bokeh** ‚Üí The quality of background blur; used to simplify and isolate.  \\\n- **Chiaroscuro** ‚Üí Strong light‚Äìdark patterning that both models form and drives attention.  \\\n- **Convergence** ‚Üí Apparent meeting of parallel lines in perspective; pulls the eye along rails to vanishing points.  \\\n- **DoF (Depth of Field)** ‚Üí Range of acceptable sharpness; narrow DoF isolates, wide DoF explains context.  \\\n- **Falloff** ‚Üí Natural decrease in light intensity; can be staged to brighten toward the subject.  \\\n- **Gateway** ‚Üí A bright/contrasty opening that invites the eye into the picture space.  \\\n- **Implied Line** ‚Üí A perceived line created by alignment of shapes, gaze, or movement.  \\\n- **Lost Edge** ‚Üí Boundary where figure and ground share a value/color so the edge disappears‚Äîused away from focal.  \\\n- **Micro-contrast** ‚Üí Fine texture/detail contrast; increases pull locally.  \\\n- **Negative Space** ‚Üí Intentional emptiness that shapes and directs attention.  \\\n- **Vector** ‚Üí Any directed cue (line, gaze, movement, gradient) that suggests where to look next.  \\\n- **Value / Value Contrast / Edge Sharpness** ‚Üí Fundamental levers: light‚Äìdark strength and edge clarity that determine first read and fixation.  \\\n- **Vanishing Point / Horizon** ‚Üí Perspective anchors controlling convergence and spatial feel.  \\\n- **Vignette** ‚Üí Edge darkening/softening to keep attention inside the frame.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":16484}]"
