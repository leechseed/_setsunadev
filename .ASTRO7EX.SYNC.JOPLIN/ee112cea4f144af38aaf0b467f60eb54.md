Each is a **constraint on meaning**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Project Scope\\\n\\\n- **Medium**: Narrative RPG\\\n- **Scale**: Dialogue → Scenes → Character Arcs → Factions → World History\\\n- **Domain Type**: Wicked / chaotic / player-participatory\\\n- **Risk**: Scale drift, power fantasy collapse, exception creep\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Defined Non-Negotiable Invariants\\\n\\\n### Invariant 1 — **Power Always Has a Cost**\\\n\\\nPower is never free, permanent, or clean.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Invariant 2 — **Systems Outlive Individuals**\\\n\\\nInstitutions, corporations, and structures persist regardless of who fights them.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Invariant 3 — **Identity Is Constructed and Fragile**\\\n\\\nSelfhood is editable, contested, and unstable under pressure.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Invariant 4 — **Violence Solves Problems but Produces Rot**\\\n\\\nViolence is effective in the short term and corrosive in the long term.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Invariant Validation Across Scale\\\n\\\n### Invariant 1: Power Always Has a Cost\\\n\\\n- **Dialogue**  \\\n  Characters repeatedly warn that cyberware, money, fame, or leverage extracts payment (loss of empathy, autonomy, health).\\\n\\\n- **Character Arc**  \\\n  V gains power (skills, reputation, augmentations) while simultaneously losing bodily integrity and temporal future.\\\n\\\n- **World History**  \\\n  Corporate dominance arises from power accumulation that annihilates governments, cities, and populations.\\\n\\\n✅ Invariant holds at all scales.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Invariant 2: Systems Outlive Individuals\\\n\\\n- **Dialogue**  \\\n  NPCs openly state that replacing corpos, bosses, or legends changes nothing.\\\n\\\n- **Character Arc**  \\\n  Regardless of V’s choices, Night City and megacorporations remain intact.\\\n\\\n- **World History**  \\\n  Corporate wars, collapses, and reconsolidations repeat across decades with different faces.\\\n\\\n✅ No individual meaningfully dismantles the system.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Invariant 3: Identity Is Constructed and Fragile\\\n\\\n- **Dialogue**  \\\n  Names, bodies, pronouns, memories, and personas are openly negotiable.\\\n\\\n- **Character Arc**  \\\n  V’s identity erodes as another consciousness overwrites memory, agency, and self-definition.\\\n\\\n- **World History**  \\\n  Engrams, digital ghosts, and brand-manufactured personas normalize unstable identity.\\\n\\\n✅ Identity never stabilizes into a “true self.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Invariant 4: Violence Solves Problems but Produces Rot\\\n\\\n- **Dialogue**  \\\n  Violence is treated as normal, expected, and effective—but never celebrated as cleansing.\\\n\\\n- **Character Arc**  \\\n  Combat advances V’s goals while isolating them, accelerating decay and loss.\\\n\\\n- **World History**  \\\n  Wars, gang conflicts, and crackdowns reshape Night City without improving it.\\\n\\\n✅ Violence works — and poisons everything it touches.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Scale Enforcement Matrix\\\n\\\n| Scale | Enforcement Question | Cyberpunk 2077 Result |\\\n|-----|----------------------|----------------------|\\\n| Word | Does this imply free power or clean victory? | No |\\\n| Dialogue | Does anyone escape consequence? | No |\\\n| Scene | Does success resolve systemic pressure? | No |\\\n| Character Arc | Is survival without loss possible? | No |\\\n| World History | Do systems collapse permanently? | No |\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Failure Tests (What Dies)\\\n\\\nThe following are **explicitly disallowed** by invariants:\\\n\\\n- Permanent liberation of Night City  \\\n- A cost-free cybernetic ascension  \\\n- A stable, final identity for V  \\\n- Violence as moral purification  \\\n- Individual hero permanently defeating megastructures  \\\n\\\nAny such element would violate invariants and be removed.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Operational Outcome\\\n\\\nBecause the invariants are enforced:\\\n\\\n- Micro-level writing and macro-level lore remain aligned\\\n- Player agency exists without granting systemic fantasy\\\n- Endings vary in tone, not in ideological truth\\\n- Expansion across DLC and media remains coherent\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Summary\\\n\\\n**Cyberpunk 2077** maintains coherence across extreme scale because it obeys a small set of **Non-Negotiable Invariants** that:\\\n\\\n- constrain meaning\\\n- survive every zoom level\\\n- override “rule of cool”\\\n\\\nThe result is a world that feels oppressive, alive, and consistent—because nothing escapes the same truths.\\\n\\\n**If it violated an invariant, it would not feel like Cyberpunk.**\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4964}]"
