12. Ass Growth Milestones – Visual & Functional Progress Markers

# Ass Growth Milestones – Visual & Functional Progress Markers

## Objective
Track physical, visual, and performance-based glute development throughout the 90-day training protocol. This file outlines growth stages, visual indicators, and celebratory benchmarks.

---

## Milestone Tiers
| Tier | Time Estimate | Visual Indicators | Functional Indicators |
|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Tier 0 – "Pancake Mode" | Day 1 | Flat, undefined, underactive | Weak glutes, poor hinge, anterior tilt |
| Tier 1 – "Starter Shelf" | Day 14 | Slight lift, soreness in glutes post-session | Able to contract glutes on command |
| Tier 2 – "Bubble Forming" | Day 30 | Curvature at top and sides, improved undercurve | Hip thrusts + RDLs > BW x 1.5 |
| Tier 3 – "Shelf Detected" | Day 60 | Noticeable shelf from side profile, jiggle begins | Controlled tempo squats, pause hip thrusts |
| Tier 4 – "Full Bounce" | Day 90 | Bouncing when walking, visible over tight shorts | Hip Thrusts 2.5x BW, Split Squat mastery |

## Visual Cues to Watch For
- Glute-ham tie-in becomes visible
- Butt looks lifted even when relaxed
- Upper glute curve visible through clothing
- Widened hips due to glute medius growth
- Lateral pop when viewed from behind

## Progress Photo Recommendations
| Angle | Frequency | Clothing |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Rear (Relaxed & Flexed) | Weekly | Tight shorts / thong / nude |
| Side Profile | Bi-weekly | Fitted underwear or compression shorts |
| From Below (Squat Angle) | Monthly | Naked / ass to camera |

## Final Note
This isn’t vanity. This is **ass ascension**. You are building the most erotic, magnetic version of your body — one rep, one thrust, one bounce at a time.

**Track the bounce. Worship the shelf. Celebrate the gain.**
