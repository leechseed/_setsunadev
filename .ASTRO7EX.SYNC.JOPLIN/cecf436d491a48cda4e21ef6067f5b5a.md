## Purpose

This document teaches how to **govern thinking and creative work** in domains that are:
- chaotic
- large in scale
- non-linear
- never truly “finished”

Examples include narrative design, worldbuilding, complex IPs, and any creative system where **adding one thing changes everything else**.

PSTO (Policy / Strategy / Tactics / Operations) is used here as a **control scaffold**:
- **Policy** anchors meaning and prevents drift.
- **Strategy** handles uncertainty and direction under partial information.
- **Tactics** choose moves at the local decision-point level.
- **Operations** run daily execution, iteration, pruning, and canonization.

---

## How to Use This Document

Treat PSTO as **zoom levels**:

- **Policy** = what must always be true (constraints, invariants, boundaries, “no-go” conditions)
- **Strategy** = how you move through uncertainty (options, bets, risk management, leverage points)
- **Tactics** = what you do next (tests, criteria, scene choices, design moves)
- **Operations** = how you keep shipping (workflow, rituals, checklists, versioning, pruning)

**Rule of thumb**
- If you feel lost: zoom **out** (Policy).
- If you feel stuck: zoom **in** (Tactics/Operations).
- If you feel scattered: re-sequence cognition (Cognitive Governance).
- If you feel bloated: converge (kill, compress, commit).

## PSTO — Systems Thinking, Complexity, and Design Science

### Thinking in Systems

**Author:** Donella H. Meadows  
**ISBN:** 978-1603580557

#### Mental Model
**Stocks and Flows**: outcomes come from accumulations + rates of change, governed by feedback and delays.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Stocks** (accumulations): tension, trust, capital, legitimacy, fear, institutional power
- **Flows** (rates): recruitment, decay, escalation, attrition, propaganda spread, resource burn
- **Feedback loops**:
  - **Reinforcing** (snowball): “power → enforcement → fear → compliance → more power”
  - **Balancing** (stabilizing): “cost → resistance → reform → lower cost”
- **Delays**: causes and effects are separated in time, so you misattribute why things happen
- **Leverage points**: small changes with huge effects (rules, information, goals, paradigms)

#### Policy
Reality (and story-worlds) are governed by **feedback + delay**, not linear causality.

#### Strategy
Build your IP as a system:
- identify the **few** stocks that matter
- locate the dominant loops
- change the rules/information/goals instead of brute-forcing events

#### Tactics
- Name 5–10 stocks (power, legitimacy, money, social cohesion, etc.)
- For each stock: define inflows/outflows and what controls them
- Identify 1 reinforcing loop and 1 balancing loop per major institution

#### Operations
- Before adding lore/plot: “What loop does this reinforce?”
- When something feels implausible: find the missing stock, delay, or loop
- When scale drift happens: enforce leverage points (rules/goals/paradigm) instead of patching scenes

### Systems Thinking Made Simple

**Authors:** Derek Cabrera, Laura Cabrera  
**ISBN:** 978-1948486026

#### Mental Model
**DSRP (Mental Grammar)**: Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, Perspectives.

	#### Core Constructs (DSRP)
- **Distinctions**: what is this vs. what it is not (hard boundaries prevent mush)
- **Systems**: parts/wholes (prevents “everything is everything” spaghetti)
- **Relationships**: causal, enabling, constraining, identity (explicit links beat vibes)
- **Perspectives**: stakeholder views, values, incentives (who believes what and why)

#### Policy
Coherence comes from **explicit structure**, not raw cleverness.

#### Strategy
Use DSRP as a **debugger**:
- if you’re confused, one of D/S/R/P is missing or inconsistent
- if the reader is confused, your distinctions or perspectives are underspecified

#### Tactics
- Run “DSRP passes” on any messy concept:
  - D: define it with a boundary
  - S: list its parts and what whole it serves
  - R: name 3 relationships that matter
  - P: list 3 perspectives that disagree about it

#### Operations
- Keep a “DSRP checklist” for every new faction/system
- Force yourself to write: “X is not Y because…”
- Rotate viewpoint explicitly: “What does the villain call this? What does the public call this?”

### The Fifth Discipline

**Author:** Peter M. Senge  
**ISBN:** 978-0385517256

#### Mental Model
**Iceberg Model**: events → patterns → structures → mental models.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Systems archetypes**: recurring failure patterns (fixes that fail, shifting the burden, etc.)
- **Mental models**: beliefs that generate structures that generate patterns
- **Learning organization**: a system that improves itself without collapsing under complexity

#### Policy
Systems persist because **beliefs reproduce structures**.

#### Strategy
To change outcomes, change:
- how information flows
- what people believe is “normal”
- what the institution rewards/punishes

#### Tactics
- Identify the “official story” vs. “operating story”
- Track incentives: “What behavior gets rewarded?”
- Diagnose archetypes: is your world stuck in “shifting the burden” (quick fixes vs. fundamental solution)?

#### Operations
- Build institutions with self-maintenance loops (rituals, bureaucracy, doctrine)
- Show reforms failing unless beliefs/incentives change
- Use “mental model collisions” as reliable conflict engines

### The Sciences of the Artificial

**Author:** Herbert A. Simon  
**ISBN:** 978-0262537537

#### Mental Model
**Design as Science**: artificial systems are designed; study them by studying constraints, goals, and bounded rationality.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Bounded rationality**: agents satisfice, they don’t optimize
- **Hierarchy**: complex systems are built from sub-systems (stackable design)
- **Near-decomposability**: subsystems interact more internally than externally (this is why modularity works)
- **Design constraints**: goals + limits define the shape of the system

#### Policy
Your IP is not “found.” It is **designed** under constraints—so treat it like an engineered artifact.

#### Strategy
Architect the world:
- define goals (what the system produces)
- define constraints (what it cannot do)
- define interfaces (how subsystems communicate)

#### Tactics
- Write “design requirements” for institutions and magic/tech systems
- Encode “satisficing” decisions: people choose the first acceptable move, not the best move
- Break complexity into modules with clear interfaces

#### Operations
- Maintain a “design spec” for canon systems (inputs/outputs/constraints)
- When inconsistencies appear, resolve them by revisiting constraints, not by lore patching
- Treat every new addition as a change request against the spec

## PSTO — Cognitive Modes and Decision Governance

### Six Thinking Hats

**Author:** Edward de Bono  
**ISBN:** 978-0316178310

#### Mental Model
**Mode Switching**: separate thinking modes so they don’t sabotage each other.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **White**: facts / unknowns
- **Red**: emotion / intuition signals
- **Black**: risk / critique
- **Yellow**: value / upside
- **Green**: alternatives / creativity
- **Blue**: process control / agenda

#### Policy
Confusion comes from **mixed modes**: critique during ideation kills output; ideation during decision kills closure.

#### Strategy
Run thinking in sequences:
- diverge first (Green)
- evaluate second (Black/Yellow)
- decide third (Blue)

#### Tactics
- Timebox each hat
- Force “Blue hat” checkpoints: “What decision is being made right now?”
- Separate “risk identification” from “risk response”

#### Operations
- Use hats as a meeting/writing-room protocol
- Maintain a “decision log” so Blue-hat outcomes persist across sessions
- Create a recurring “Black hat audit” for canon-breaking risks

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

**Author:** Daniel Kahneman  
**ISBN:** 978-0374533557

#### Mental Model
**Two Systems**: fast intuitive judgment vs. slow deliberate reasoning.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Heuristics and biases**: you will hallucinate causes, overfit patterns, and trust vibes
- **Overconfidence**: especially lethal in canon decisions and “it’s obvious” story logic
- **Availability**: you overuse what’s most vivid/recent instead of what’s structurally correct

#### Policy
Intuition is useful—but **unreliable under complexity and high stakes**.

#### Strategy
Slow down decisions that:
- lock canon
- set tone/theme/invariants
- introduce new system rules

#### Tactics
- Insert “slow-thinking gates” for irreversible decisions
- Ask: “What evidence would prove this wrong?”
- Beware “narrative fallacy”: coherent story ≠ true cause

#### Operations
- Create a short “bias checklist” for major story commits
- Force counterfactual tests: “If this were false, what else would explain it?”
- Do premortems before committing to big arcs/systems

---

### How to Solve It

**Author:** George Pólya  
**ISBN:** 978-0691119663

#### Mental Model
**Problem-Solving Loop**: understand → plan → execute → review.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Heuristic questioning**: translate vague problems into solvable forms
- **Related problems**: solve a simpler version first; then scale it back up
- **Looking back**: extract method, not just result (so you can reuse it)

#### Policy
Most “creative block” is actually **problem definition failure**.

#### Strategy
Turn writing/design issues into explicit problem types:
- contradiction
- missing constraint
- unclear objective
- wrong scale
- wrong model

#### Tactics
- Rephrase the problem 3 different ways
- Solve a reduced version (smaller cast, smaller stakes, shorter timeframe)
- Use analogies and invariants as constraint tools

#### Operations
- Keep a “problem ledger” (problem → plan → result → reusable heuristic)
- Convert frustration into a question (“What do I not understand yet?”)
- Require a post-solve write-up: what did you learn that prevents recurrence?

---

## PSTO — Creative Convergence and Ideation Control

### Creative Confidence

**Authors:** Tom Kelley, David Kelley  
**ISBN:** 978-0385349369

#### Mental Model
**Make to Learn**: confidence is built through action + feedback loops, not inspiration.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Self-efficacy**: the belief you can produce outcomes—critical for long-form IP
- **Rapid prototyping**: reduce fear by shrinking the cost of being wrong
- **Reframing**: treat problems as design prompts, not identity judgments

#### Policy
Creativity is not a trait; it’s **a repeatable practice under feedback**.

#### Strategy
Build a pipeline that rewards shipping:
- prototypes early
- critique later
- commit with evidence

#### Tactics
- Prototype scenes, arcs, factions, UI, rules as cheap drafts
- Use “small bets” rather than giant monolithic commitments
- Replace debate with tests

#### Operations
- Maintain a prototype backlog
- Set a “ship cadence” (weekly outputs)
- Enforce “decision closure”: every cycle ends with commit/kill/defer-with-date

---

### The Universal Traveler

**Authors:** Don Koberg, Jim Bagnall  
**ISBN:** 978-1560520450

#### Mental Model
**Soft-Systems Creativity Workbook**: structured prompts that force movement when you’re stuck.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Goal shaping**: clarify what “done” looks like
- **Diverge/converge cycles**: deliberate expansion and narrowing
- **Lateral prompts**: break fixation by forcing category shifts

#### Policy
Forward motion requires **structured prompts**, not willpower.

#### Strategy
Use the Traveler when:
- you need options fast
- you’re stuck in one interpretation
- you need to break a deadlock in design

#### Tactics
- Run one cycle: generate 20 options, then reduce to 3 with criteria
- Force weirdness: “Do the opposite,” “Change the medium,” “Invert the value”
- Use constraint games to reveal hidden invariants

#### Operations
- Keep a “Traveler session” template for 30–60 minutes
- Archive your option lists (they become future fuel)
- Turn winning options into requirements (so they don’t evaporate)

---

### Design Methods

**Author:** John Chris Jones  
**ISBN:** 978-0471284963

#### Mental Model
**Design as Method, Not Mood**: complex design needs explicit methods and staged process.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Divergence → Transformation → Convergence** (classic design process staging)
- **Method selection**: different problems require different methods
- **Complexity handling**: design fails when the method doesn’t match the problem class

#### Policy
Method mismatch creates chaos: you can’t “brainstorm” your way through systems architecture.

#### Strategy
Pick methods intentionally:
- use divergent methods to map possibility space
- use transformation methods to restructure
- use convergent methods to decide and commit

#### Tactics
- Maintain a “method menu” (which method for which problem)
- Separate “explore the space” from “choose a solution”
- Create decision criteria before you evaluate options

#### Operations
- Run your creative work like a design program with phases
- Keep artifacts per phase (maps, criteria, prototypes, decisions)
- Treat convergence as mandatory (or your project becomes a graveyard of fragments)

---

### Gamestorming

**Authors:** Dave Gray, Sunni Brown, James Macanufo  
**ISBN:** 978-0596804176

#### Mental Model
**Externalized Group Cognition**: put thinking on the wall so working memory stops choking.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Games as processes**: repeatable formats that generate outcomes
- **Shared models**: alignment through visible structure
- **Constraint-based play**: creativity improves when rules exist

#### Policy
Complex thinking improves when made **visible and manipulable**.

#### Strategy
Use games to:
- align a team (even if the “team” is future-you)
- generate options
- force decisions with structure

#### Tactics
- Use canvases and structured diagrams, not blank pages
- Break problems into rounds: generate → cluster → name → vote → decide
- Choose a game format based on what you need: ideas, alignment, or decision

#### Operations
- Keep a stable set of “default games” for your workflow
- Archive boards (photos, docs) as canonical references
- Treat diagrams as first-class production assets

## PSTO — Narrative and Scale Cognition

### Storythinking

**Author:** Angus Fletcher  
**ISBN:** 978-0231206938

#### Mental Model
**Narrative Intelligence**: story is a tool for managing complexity, prediction, cooperation, identity, and meaning across time.

#### Core Constructs (Meat)
- **Narrative as cognition**: story is a mental technology, not decoration
- **Scale coherence**: micro-actions must carry macro-meaning (sentence → scene → arc → society)
- **Patterned pressure**: repeated stress tests reveal values, not speeches

#### Policy
Narrative coherence comes from **consistent meaning under pressure**, not lore density.

#### Strategy
Use storythinking to keep scale legible:
- build repeatable patterns (pressure → choice → cost)
- keep choices aligned with your world’s system logic
- ensure local wins don’t break global truth

#### Tactics
- Treat choices as tests of invariants (“does this violate the rule of gravity?”)
- Use recurring pressures (money, legitimacy, fear, love, status) to create thematic consistency
- Build “scale ladders”: one beat that echoes at multiple zoom levels

#### Operations
- Create a “scale checklist” for every major beat:
  - does dialogue reflect world-truth?
  - does the scene reinforce the dominant loops?
  - does the arc pay a real cost?
- Maintain a canon “meaning spec” (your invariants + what they forbid)
- Audit for drift every 5–10 chapters/episodes
