# 📘 Layer 4 — Expression Mechanics  
## Transmission Moves (Canonical Set)

> Transmission moves are **mechanical actions** that carry pressure forward moment-to-moment.  
> They do not create meaning or power; they **transfer, concentrate, or expose** it.  
> Every effective scene beat performs at least one move.

## 1. Commit
- **Function**: Convert possibility into obligation.
- **Carriers**: Speech, signed action, public choice, irreversible step.
- **Effect**: Narrows future options; creates residue.
- **Cost Signal**: Accountability increases.
- **Failure if**: The commitment can be walked back without consequence.

---

## 2. Refuse
- **Function**: Deny cooperation without proposing an alternative.
- **Carriers**: Silence, withdrawal of consent, procedural noncompliance.
- **Effect**: Transfers burden and risk outward.
- **Cost Signal**: Pressure redirects or escalates.
- **Failure if**: Refusal is treated as neutral or safe.

---

## 3. Reveal
- **Function**: Make information legible at a cost.
- **Carriers**: Confession, disclosure, evidence surfaced.
- **Effect**: Reconfigures leverage and threat vectors.
- **Cost Signal**: Exposure creates vulnerability.
- **Failure if**: Knowledge arrives without changing behavior or stakes.

---

## 4. Delay
- **Function**: Convert time into pressure.
- **Carriers**: Procedural stalling, silence, conditional deferral.
- **Effect**: Accumulation favors existing power.
- **Cost Signal**: Options decay while waiting.
- **Failure if**: Delay preserves neutrality or freezes consequences.

---

## 5. Escalate
- **Function**: Increase stakes when resolution is blocked.
- **Carriers**: Expanded demands, raised consequences, widened scope.
- **Effect**: Reduces exit paths; accelerates conflict.
- **Cost Signal**: Loss becomes more expensive.
- **Failure if**: Escalation adds noise without narrowing outcomes.

---

## 6. Isolate
- **Function**: Cut off circulation, relevance, or reach.
- **Carriers**: Exclusion, blacklisting, containment, silence imposed.
- **Effect**: Survival without impact.
- **Cost Signal**: Agency collapses to the local.
- **Failure if**: Isolation is framed as freedom or resolution.

---

## 7. Transfer Risk
- **Function**: Move danger, blame, or consequence to another party.
- **Carriers**: Delegation, implication, proxy action.
- **Effect**: Responsibility diffuses; outcomes persist.
- **Cost Signal**: Moral residue without direct exposure.
- **Failure if**: No one bears the transferred cost.

---

## 8. Close
- **Function**: Permanently foreclose options.
- **Carriers**: Final decisions, burned bridges, public records.
- **Effect**: Future paths collapse into fewer states.
- **Cost Signal**: Irreversibility is explicit.
- **Failure if**: Closure can be reopened without loss.

---

## Usage Rules

- Every **scene beat** must perform **≥1 transmission move**.
- Strong scenes perform **2–3**, with one dominant.
- Moves may be **quiet** (silence, delay) or **loud** (reveal, escalate).
- Moves **do not guarantee success**; they only move pressure.

---

## Integrity Checks

- If dialogue performs no move → **decorative**.
- If a scene ends with the same option space → **static**.
- If information arrives without cost → **exposition leak**.
- If emotion substitutes for a move → **Layer 3 violation**.

---

## Design Constraint

> Transmission moves move **pressure**, not **justice**, not **truth**, not **hope**.

They make things harder, smaller, clearer, or more expensive—  
never easier by default.
