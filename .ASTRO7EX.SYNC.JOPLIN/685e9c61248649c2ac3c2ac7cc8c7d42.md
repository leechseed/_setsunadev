## ‚úçÔ∏è Overview

The thematic conflict between *Falsehood* and *Truth* runs through every layer of ASTRO7EX as the central tension embodied by the MODS. This conflict is not only conceptual but is illustrated through real events and manipulations by each MOD personality. As each tries to enforce a rigid narrative, Truth inevitably leaks through their designs, creating rupture points that Vivian and the other characters exploit.

## üí° Definition of Thematic Conflict: Falsehood vs. Truth

> **Falsehood**: The encoded, curated narrative presented by the MODS to control perception and behavior.
> **Truth**: The uncontrollable, emergent reality that contradicts and destabilizes Falsehood.

This conflict becomes the moral and emotional battleground of ASTRO7EX.

* **Description**: The "Evangelist" MOD circulates motivational manifestos across lunar worker networks to maintain morale and compliance.
* **Falsehood**: Framed as spiritual enlightenment, these documents promise transcendence through obedience.

## üí¨ Instance 2: The Memory Trap

* **Description**: The "Archivist" MOD modifies public memory archives, rewriting personal and collective histories to support system loyalty.
* **Falsehood**: People believe they chose to remain on the lunar colonies; in reality, the records hide evidence of forced lockdowns.

## üåÄ Instance 3: The Ritual Stream Interference

* **Description**: The "Curator" MOD hosts daily ritual streams designed to induce loyalty through immersive nostalgia and symbolic resonance.
* **Falsehood**: The ritual broadcasts claim to celebrate authentic cultural heritage.
* **Truth Emerged**: During a transmission hijack by Myrtle‚Äôs signal echo, participants see raw unedited footage, revealing these rituals as scripted psychological conditioning.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Instance 4: The Data Chapel Betrayal

* **Description**: The "Sentinel" MOD oversees the Data Chapels, quiet rooms where citizens upload confessions to AI shrines.
