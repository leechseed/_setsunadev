Period.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Pre-Phase Checklist (Before You Spend Anything)\\\n\\\nBefore you start throwing chaos around:\\\n\\\n1. **Open PoB with your current character.**\\\n2. Verify:\\\n   - Your **main Flicker Strike setup** is correctly imported.\\\n   - You can swap gear in PoB and see impact on DPS, hit chance, and EHP.\\\n3. **Set up your loot filter.**\\\n   - Use a semi-strict filter:\\\n     - Show currency, scarabs, essences, maps, 6-sockets, jewels, decent bases.\\\n     - Hide 99% of rares.\\\n4. **Clean your stash.**\\\n   - Dump *everything* into a “junk” tab.\\\n   - Make a new tab called `PHASE_1_SELL`.\\\n   - Make a tab called `PHASE_1_CURRENCY`.\\\n\\\nYou are going to treat this like a project, not hoarder mode.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 1 – Fix the Foundation (Life, Resists, Flasks)\\\n\\\n### 1.1 Check Your Defenses in PoB\\\n\\\nIn PoB, for your current gear:\\\n\\\n- **Life**: if you’re under ~4k at red maps, that’s a problem.\\\n- **Resists** (with flasks off):\\\n  - Fire/Cold/Lightning **≥ 75%** (capped).\\\n  - Chaos resist doesn’t need to be high in Phase 1, but being **≥ 0%** is nice.\\\n\\\nIf this is not true, gear upgrades go to **defense first**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 1.2 Flasks – Non-Negotiable Setup\\\n\\\nYou need **functional** flasks before big damage:\\\n\\\n- **Life Flask**\\\n  - Instant or semi-instant life.\\\n  - “of Staunching” (bleed removal) or equivalent.\\\n- **Utility Flasks** (any 3–4 from below)\\\n  - Granite (armour), Jade (evasion), Basalt, Quartz.\\\n  - Quicksilver (movespeed).\\\n- **Suffixes**\\\n  - Bleed removal on *one* flask.\\\n  - Freeze removal on *another*.\\\n  - Then fill with:\\\n    - Increased armour/evasion.\\\n    - Reduced effect of curses.\\\n    - Movement speed.\\\n\\\nRoll them to something “good enough.” Do not obsess here. Just **functional**, not perfect.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 2 – Buy a Real Weapon (400–500 PDPS)\\\n\\\nRight now, weapon is your biggest damage lever.\\\n\\\n### 2.1 What You’re Looking For\\\n\\\nFor **Phase 1**, target:\\\n\\\n- Base: **Fleshripper** or other solid 2H axe.\\\n- **Total PDPS**: at least **400–500**.\\\n- Mods you care about:\\\n  - High **% increased Physical Damage**.\\\n  - Decent **flat added Physical Damage**.\\\n  - Some **Attack Speed**.\\\n  - Some **Crit Chance** if possible.\\\n\\\nYou do **not** need multi-influence, “double damage”, or mirror-tier garbage. You need a **sledgehammer**, not Excalibur.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 2.2 Budget & Discipline\\\n\\\n- Expect to spend **30–50c** on a perfectly fine Phase 1 weapon.\\\n- Do *not* sink more than ~1 divine into a Phase 1 axe.\\\n  - If you see yourself spending more than that, you’re jumping ahead into Phase 2/3 logic and wasting your economy curve.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 2.3 Sanity Check in PoB\\\n\\\nOnce you’ve bought a candidate:\\\n\\\n- Slot it in PoB:\\\n  - Check DPS jump on Flicker Strike.\\\n  - Check hit chance (if it tanks, you need more accuracy elsewhere).\\\n- If the DPS barely moves, your tree/gems might be the bigger issue; but for Phase 1, the weapon almost always does heavy lifting.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 3 – Rings, Amulet, Belt (Core Stat Blocks)\\\n\\\nThese three slots often carry **accuracy, flat phys, resists, and life**. You’re not crafting, you’re buying cheap but efficient rares.\\\n\\\n### 3.1 Rings (High Priority)\\\n\\\nEach ring should ideally have:\\\n\\\n- **Required**\\\n  - Life.\\\n  - Resists.\\\n  - Accuracy rating.\\\n- **Nice to Have**\\\n  - Flat phys to attacks.\\\n  - Attack speed.\\\n  - Attributes (str/dex/int if you’re short).\\\n\\\nIf your accuracy is low in PoB (hit chance < 95%), rings are **your fix.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.2 Amulet\\\n\\\nLook for:\\\n\\\n- Life.\\\n- Flat phys.\\\n- Crit multi or generic damage.\\\n- Attributes if needed.\\\n- Some resist if you can get it.\\\n\\\nAnoint: choose something cheap and useful for now (e.g. small life/attack nodes). Don’t blow expensive oils at Phase 1.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.3 Belt\\\n\\\nFor Phase 1, the belt is a **defensive anchor**:\\\n\\\n- Life.\\\n- 2–3 high resist rolls.\\\n- Maybe some flask stuff or armour.\\\n\\\nCheap, high-life, triple-res belts exist. Don’t overcomplicate it.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 4 – Quick Passive Tree & Gem Check\\\n\\\nYou’re not redoing your whole tree in Phase 1. You’re just making sure nothing is **extra stupid.**\\\n\\\n### 4.1 Passive Tree Sanity\\\n\\\nIn PoB, check:\\\n\\\n- Are you taking:\\\n  - Life wheels near Duelist/Marauder?\\\n  - Axe/2H clusters that actually affect your weapon?\\\n- Are there any:\\\n  - +minion damage.\\\n  - Spell damage.\\\n  - Useless keystones?\\\n\\\nIf yes, respect a few points into something that actually helps: life or axe damage.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.2 Gem Links\\\n\\\nPhase 1 goal: **proper 5L or 6L Flicker Strike** with coherent support gems.\\\n\\\nAt minimum, your Flicker link should look like a real attack setup, not:\\\n\\\n- Flicker + random garbage supports.\\\n\\\nIf you have scuffed colors, **fix sockets/links** on your chest or axe to fit a sane Flicker Strike 5L/6L.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 5 – Map Selection & Atlas Strategy (Phase 1)\\\n\\\nYou aren’t doing galaxy brain here. You are doing **fast, repeatable, low-brain** mapping that prints chaos.\\\n\\\n### 5.1 Map Tier\\\n\\\n- Aim: **T8–T14**.\\\n  - High enough to drop decent loot.\\\n  - Low enough to avoid constant rips if defenses aren’t fully online.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5.2 Layout Preference\\\n\\\nPick **open, linear maps** so Flicker can actually do its thing:\\\n\\\n- Dunes.\\\n- Strand.\\\n- Tropical Island.\\\n- Beach.\\\n- Burial Chambers.\\\n- Whatever similar layouts you have.\\\n\\\nAvoid early on:\\\n\\\n- Maze-like or multi-floor maps.\\\n- Map bosses that require a ton of downtime and mechanics.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5.3 Atlas Tree Priorities\\\n\\\nPhase 1 priorities:\\\n\\\n- **Essences** – always worth stopping for.\\\n- **Strongboxes** – big currency spikes, especially with Atlas nodes.\\\n- **Shrines** – Flicker + shrines = trivial clears.\\\n- **Harbinger/Abyss** – if you enjoy them and can handle them safely.\\\n\\\nDo **not** invest into high-juice Delirium, insane altars, or double-rippy mechanics until Phase 2/3.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 6 – Loot Discipline & Selling Loop\\\n\\\nYou’re trying to get to **3 Divines**. Not admire the shape of every yellow item.\\\n\\\n### 6.1 What You Always Pick Up\\\n\\\nEvery map, without overthinking:\\\n\\\n- All currency.\\\n- All scarabs.\\\n- All essences (except true garbage, if you want).\\\n- All maps.\\\n- All 6-socket items (vendor for Jeweller’s).\\\n- Rare **jewels**, **cluster jewels**, and notable bases (axes, amulets, belts) if you can tolerate small ID overhead.\\\n\\\nEverything else: your filter should mostly hide it anyway.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 6.2 Stash Workflow\\\n\\\nAfter each batch of maps:\\\n\\\n1. Dump all loot into `PHASE_1_SELL`.\\\n2. From there:\\\n   - Convert 6-sockets to Jeweller’s.\\\n   - ID **only**:\\\n     - Rare jewels / clusters.\\\n     - Obvious “this could be crazy” items (high-ilvl weapon bases, influenced amulets, etc.).\\\n3. Anything not obviously good → sell to vendor or ignore.\\\n\\\nYou are optimizing **time → currency**, not “check every rare like it’s 2013.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 6.3 Converting to Divines\\\n\\\nAs you accumulate chaos:\\\n\\\n- Every time you hit ~150–200c, consider converting to a **Divine** or near-div value:\\\n  - Sell chaos for divines if rates are decent.\\\n  - Keep some chaos (~50–80c) for small purchases and maps.\\\n\\\nThe point is to **see your real progress**, not just sit on 600 unorganized chaos.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 7 – Daily Operational Loop\\\n\\\nThis is what an actual session in Phase 1 should look like.\\\n\\\n### 7.1 Before Mapping\\\n\\\n1. Check flasks:\\\n   - Charges.\\\n   - Correct suffixes.\\\n2. Check:\\\n   - You’re on correct Flicker setup.\\\n   - Auras on.\\\n   - Blood Rage setup ready.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 7.2 While Mapping\\\n\\\n- Focus:\\\n  - Positioning and pathing (where Flicker will bounce).\\\n  - Not face-planting into obvious death zones.\\\n- Always:\\\n  - Click essences.\\\n  - Open strongboxes (with a little caution).\\\n  - Grab shrines.\\\n\\\nIgnore:\\\n\\\n- Long-winded side content that breaks your tempo (especially if you die to it).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 7.3 After Every 3–5 Maps\\\n\\\n1. Dump loot into `PHASE_1_SELL`.\\\n2. Do quick vendor passes:\\\n   - Sell 6-sockets.\\\n   - Convert stuff you know is garbage.\\\n3. Check currency tab:\\\n   - Track your progress in chaos + div.\\\n\\\nIf the build feels noticeably better and your chaos is rising faster than you spend it, Phase 1 is working.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Mistakes in Phase 1\\\n\\\n1. **Overspending on “perfect” early gear.**\\\n   - You’re not here to roll T1 everything.\\\n   - You’re here to stop bleeding and start earning.\\\n\\\n2. **Ignoring defenses.**\\\n   - A 700 PDPS axe is worthless if you’re dead every map.\\\n   - Resists and life are not optional.\\\n\\\n3. **Looting too much trash.**\\\n   - Time spent ID’ing junk = div/hour down the drain.\\\n   - Use a stricter filter and respect your time.\\\n\\\n4. **Trying to run top-end juice too early.**\\\n   - You do **not** need 60% delirious maps right now.\\\n   - You need stable, repeatable T10–T14 farm.\\\n\\\n5. **Chasing crafts instead of just buying.**\\\n   - In Phase 1, crafting is almost always a currency sink, not a generator.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Transition Trigger – When to Start Phase 2\\\n\\\nMove to Phase 2 (3d → 15d) **only** when:\\\n\\\n- You have **≥ 3 Divines** worth of currency.\\\n- You’re:\\\n  - **Capped resists**.\\\n  - ~4.5k+ life (or appropriate for level).\\\n  - Hit chance near 100%.\\\n  - Running T10–T14 with **low death frequency**.\\\n- Flicker feels **mostly stable**, even if damage isn’t insane yet.\\\n\\\nAt that point, you’ve done your job:  \\\nPhase 1 is complete. You’ve built a **reliable money printer**.  \\\n\\\nPhase 2 is where we start leaning into real damage and the “Farrul’s + high PDPS axe” identity.\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":11345}]"
