Every like and dislike affirms his commitment to sovereignty, disciplined devotion, and spiritual guardianship. His attachments are never casual‚Äîthey are oaths. Drawing from *The Erotic Mind* (Morin), *King, Warrior, Magician, Lover* (Moore & Gillette), and *Iron John* (Bly), Nacho‚Äôs catalog of interests forms a quiet liturgy of masculine sanctity and restraint.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ‚úÖ Core Likes\\\n\\\n* **Silent Vigilance**\\\n\\\n  * Derives profound satisfaction from observation without intervention;
