## Overview

This entry breaks your Flicker Strike Champion plan into four stacked layers:

- **Policy** – non-negotiable high-level rules of the build.
- **Strategy** – long-range plans to satisfy those rules.
- **Tactics** – specific setups, items, and configurations.
- **Operations** – what you physically do in a mapping session or upgrade cycle.

You can read top-down for understanding, or bottom-up if you just want “what to do today” and then trace the logic upward.

---

## Policy Layer (What This Build *Is For*)

### Core Policy 1 – Currency First

- **Statement**: The build exists to print currency first, flex into completion and bossing after.
- **Implications**:
  - Mapping performance and uptime are prioritized over boss one-shots.
  - Content choice is evaluated primarily by **profit per unit effort**, not prestige.
  - You do not invest heavily into “flex” gear that does not pay itself back in farm speed or survivability.
  - Early and mid-game decisions are judged by their impact on **div/hour**.

---

### Core Policy 2 – Level 100 As a Design Constraint

- **Statement**: The build must be capable of reaching 100 without feeling like self-harm.
- **Implications**:
  - No “glass cannon” bullshit. You don’t trade all defenses for DPS.
  - Mapping focus on **safe layouts**, **predictable threats**, and **repeatable routes**.
  - You avoid mechanics that spike RNG death (deep delirium, rippy expedition combos) until your defenses are appropriate.
  - XP loss on death is treated as an economic loss, not just “oops”.

---

### Core Policy 3 – Tankiness Over Ego DPS

- **Statement**: You will sacrifice theoretical DPS for **real-world uptime** and death avoidance.
- **Implications**:
  - Capped resists, spell suppression, and defenses are *non-negotiable* before big DPS spikes.
  - Flask automation and defenses get bought before shiny damage jewels.
  - If PoB says you lose 5% DPS to gain 20% effective HP, you take the tank.

---

### Core Policy 4 – Automation Over APM

- **Statement**: The build’s ceiling is defined by **how much you can automate**, not how fast you can mash buttons.
- **Implications**:
  - Charge generation is automated via Farrul’s ecosystem + gem setup, not manual generation.
  - Flasks are automated with “used at full charges” and similar enchants.
  - You focus on **positioning and macro decisions**, not piano mechanics.
  - Any manual input that doesn’t significantly increase survival or div/hour is suspect.

---

## Strategy Layer (How We Intend to Achieve It)

### Strategy A – Phase-Based Economic Scaling

Break progression into economic phases:

1. **Phase 1 – 70c → 3d**
   - Objective: stabilize mapping, fix scuff gear, get a decent axe.
   - Play: mid-tier maps, basic mechanics (essence, strongboxes, shrines, abyss).

2. **Phase 2 – 3d → 15d**
   - Objective: secure 600–700 PDPS axe, fix accuracy/crit, stabilize Flicker sustain.
   - Play: T14–T16 maps, basic atlas tree tuned for consistent juice.

3. **Phase 3 – 15d → 50d**
   - Objective: acquire **Farrul’s Fur**, core clusters, first big flasks.
   - Play: targeted currency engines (Legion / Harbinger / Abyss depending on taste).

4. **Phase 4 – 50d → 120d+**
   - Objective: Replica Farrul’s, insane axe, double-influenced jewelry.
   - Play: fully juiced mapping or bossing as chosen; maintain high uptime with low death count.

**Reasoning**:  
This prevents “I have 5 div, time to yolo a mirror-tier craft” and instead forces structured capital growth.

---

### Strategy B – Weapon-First DPS Scaling

- **Premise**: For 2H Flicker, your axe is the biggest DPS lever by a mile.
- **Order of priority**:
  1. **Axe PDPS** (400 → 600 → 800+)
  2. **Crit consistency** (base + diamond flask + tree + jewels)
  3. **Attack speed**
  4. Secondary DPS sources (jewels, amulet, clusters, etc.)

- **Why**:
  - Every other offensive upgrade’s value scales with the raw PDPS of the weapon.
  - Early currency invested into a good axe gives multiplicative returns across all other systems.

---

### Strategy C – Charge Ecosystem for Flicker Stability

Flicker Strike is worthless if you desync or de-charge.

- **Goal**: Never think about charges. They just exist.
- **Layers**:
  - Aspect of the Cat (Farrul’s / Replica Farrul’s).
  - Frenzy on hit (rings, gems, or corrupts).
  - Blood Rage + Poacher’s Mark / other frenzies.
  - Endurance charges from Ascendancy / Cat’s Agility interactions.

**Policy**: You don’t try to “play well” to sustain Flicker; you buy/build systems so that **even bad play** doesn’t break the chain.

---

### Strategy D – Defensive Layer Stacking

For Champion Flicker:

- **Armor** → mitigates physical hits.
- **Evasion** → avoids hits entirely.
- **Spell Suppression** → halves spell damage.
- **Block (if used)** → extra layer, but not mandatory.
- **Endurance Charges** → phys reduction + ele res.
- **Fortify** → flat % damage reduction.

**Strategic rule**:  
You layer at least **3** of these defenses before pushing into really rippy content. Champion is chosen exactly because it stacks these easily.

---

### Strategy E – Atlas & Content Targeting

- Your atlas tree is not “whatever is fun”, it’s built around:
  - **Profit density per map**.
  - **Low time-to-clear per map** (Flicker loves open layouts).
  - **Low mechanical complexity** (no long time-stop mechanics).

- Preferred mapping:
  - Open maps: **Dunes, Strand, Tropical Island, Burial, Beach, Waste Pool**.
  - Mechanics with fast payoff: **Harbinger, Legion, Strongbox, Abyss, Essences**.
  - Avoid early: deep Delirium, high-risk Expedition, super rippy altars if defenses are not ready.

---

## Tactics Layer (Concrete Choices and Configurations)

### Tactics: Gear by Phase

#### Phase 1 (70c → 3d)

- **Weapon**
  - 2H Axe, 400–500 PDPS.
  - Don’t obsess over perfect affixes; just get decent PDPS and crit.

- **Rings**
  - Must-have: **accuracy + flat phys + life + resists**.
  - Optional: attack speed.

- **Amulet**
  - Flat phys, crit multi, attributes.
  - Anoint something cheap but useful (e.g., life/attack nodes).

- **Body Armour**
  - Anything with life + resists that allows a decent 5L/6L.
  - Bronn’s is fine early if you own it; don’t overvalue it relative to life/res.

#### Phase 2 (3d → 15d)

- **Weapon**
  - Move to 600–700 PDPS.
  - Look for T2–T1 flat + % phys and some crit/AS.

- **Helmet/Gloves/Boots**
  - Cap resists.
  - Get spell suppression started.
  - Some life and movement speed.

- **Jewels**
  - Simple damage + life combos.
  - Attack speed with axes, multi, etc.

#### Phase 3 (15d → 50d)

- **Body Armour**
  - Buy **Farrul’s Fur**.
  - This is non-negotiable for the “real” build identity.

- **Cluster Jewels**
  - Large: 8-passive, with Fuel the Fight + Martial Prowess + 3rd damage notable.
  - Medium: generic attack or crit clusters as needed.

- **Flasks**
  - Taste of Hate, Lion’s Roar, Diamond with good suffixes.

#### Phase 4 (50d → 120d+)

- **Body Armour**
  - Upgrade to **Replica Farrul’s Fur**.

- **Axe**
  - 900+ PDPS, ideally influenced, with T1 phys, hybrid phys, AS, crit.

- **Rings & Amulet**
  - Influence combos:
    - Vulnerability on hit.
    - Assassin’s Mark.
    - Huge crit multi and phys rolls.

---

### Tactics: Skill Gems & Links

Core 6L Flicker Strike link (example structure):

- **Flicker Strike**
- Multistrike
- Melee Physical Damage
- Rage / Brutality / Close Combat (depends on final config)
- Fortify / Impale (build-dependent)
- Increased Crit Damage / Nightblade / other DPS support as per PoB

Utility skills:

- **Blood Rage** – frenzies + attack speed.
- **Ancestral Protector / Warchief** – extra damage on bosses.
- **Auras** – Pride / Precision / Determination / Defiance Banner / etc. as allowed by mana.
- **Movement** – Leap Slam / Dash for when Flicker is unsafe.

---

### Tactics: Passive Tree, Ascendancy, and Clusters

- **Ascendancy** (Champion):
  - Fortitude → Unstoppable Hero → Conqueror → Worthy Foe / First to Strike, Last to Fall (depending on PoB).
- **Tree priorities**:
  - Life + life% near Marauder/Duelist.
  - Axe damage and 2H cluster wheels.
  - Crit chance + multi near Duelist/Ranger side.
  - Spell suppression where efficient.
- **Clusters**:
  - Large (Attacks): Fuel the Fight + Martial Prowess + damage notable.
  - Medium: Crit or area/strike if relevant.
  - Small: Life or utility (res/suppression).

---

### Tactics: Flask and Utility Setup

Core flask lineup:

1. **Diamond Flask**
   - Suffix: crit/movespeed/curse reduction.
   - Auto-use at full charges.

2. **Silver Flask**
   - Onslaught uptime.
   - Auto-use at full charges.

3. **Granite / Jade**
   - For armour/evasion.
   - Suffix: increased armour/evasion, reduced crit damage taken, etc.

4. **Life Flask**
   - Instant recovery.
   - Bleed removal.

5. **Unique flasks (Phase 3+)**
   - Taste of Hate.
   - Lion’s Roar.
   - Bottled Faith (later).

You configure everything to minimize manual keypresses and maximize uptime.

---

## Operations Layer (What You Actually Do Per Session)

### Ops 1 – 70c → 3 Divines

**Objective**: Stabilize the build so mapping doesn’t feel like a bar fight with a spoon.

**Operational loop**:

1. **Buy upgrades in this exact order**:
   - 400–500 PDPS axe.
   - Two rings with accuracy + flat phys + life + res.
   - Amulet with any mix of phys/crit/attributes.
   - Basic flasks with correct automation.

2. **Run mid-tier maps (T8–T12)** with:
   - Essences.
   - Strongboxes.
   - Shrines.
   - Harbinger/Abyss when available.

3. **Vendor hygiene**:
   - Pick up and sell 6-socket items.
   - Pick up currencies, scarabs, essences, jewels, maps.
   - Filter out obvious dogshit; do not loot hoard.

4. **Stop Phase 1** once:
   - You have **3 divines** or equivalent in liquid + easily sold items.
   - Your hit chance and resists are reasonable (close to capped).

---

### Ops 2 – 3 Divines → 15 Divines

**Objective**: Turn the build into “real Flicker”.

**Operational steps**:

1. **Buy 600–700 PDPS 2H Axe**.
2. **Recheck PoB**:
   - Hit chance → push close to 100%.
   - Crit chance → 50–70% pre-flask.
3. **Fix charge sustain**:
   - Ensure Blood Rage is active.
   - Get at least one extra source of frenzies (ring, corrupted item, etc.).
4. **Mapping routine**:
   - Move into T14–T16.
   - Run consistent mechanics (Harbinger, Essence, Strongboxes).
   - Ignore niche/slow mechanics that pause your flicker tempo.
5. **Stop Phase 2** when:
   - You have **15 divines**+
   - Mapping feels fast and stable, few or no desyncs in charges.

---

### Ops 3 – 15 Divines → 50 Divines

**Objective**: Snap the build into its intended identity.

**Operational steps**:

1. **Buy Farrul’s Fur**.
2. **Adjust skills / auras** to integrate Aspect of the Cat.
3. **Buy large cluster jewel(s)** with correct notables.
4. **Start using at least one unique flask** (Taste of Hate, Lion’s Roar).
5. **Atlas**:
   - Specialize into your preferred high-value mechanic (Legion/Harbinger/Abyss).
   - Run the same 1–2 layouts repeatedly for muscle memory and speed.
6. **Stop Phase 3** at:
   - **50 divines**+
   - Flicker feels “hands-off” with charges and you can ignore most micro-decisions.

---

### Ops 4 – 50+ Divines → Top 1% State

**Objective**: Convert wealth into obscene gear without bricking your sanity.

**Operational steps**:

1. **Upgrade armour** to Replica Farrul’s.
2. **Plan the axe**:
   - Either buy high-end crafted 900+ PDPS Fleshripper.
   - Or buy an in-progress craft and finish with meta-mods (if you’re comfortable).

3. **Upgrade jewelry**:
   - Prioritize rings with on-hit curses and phys/crit.
   - Upgrade amulet to heavy crit multi and phys.

4. **Perfect clusters and jewels**:
   - Add life and multi everywhere.
   - Get specific damage mods that synergize with your final tree.

5. **Shift content**:
   - Mix high-juice mapping with occasional boss rotations (Shaper/Elder/Feared) to “test”.
   - Stay away from dumb death content when close to 100.

---

## Risk Management & Failure Modes

### Failure Mode 1 – “I Die Too Much”

- **Likely causes**:
  - No suppression.
  - Low life pool.
  - No armour/evasion flasks.
  - Brute forcing too high juice too early.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Temporarily downgrade map juice.
  - Buy cheap defensive upgrades (suppression/res gear).
  - Fix flask suffixes.

---

### Failure Mode 2 – “Flicker Keeps Stopping”

- **Likely causes**:
  - Inconsistent frenzies.
  - No Blood Rage uptime.
  - Poor Poacher’s/Farrul’s integration.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Prioritize charge sources over pure DPS.
  - Check if you’re overwriting Cat buffs.
  - Simplify aura setup if you’re mana-starving links.

---

### Failure Mode 3 – “I’m Broke But My Build Is Fine”

- **Likely causes**:
  - Running low-value mechanics.
  - Looting too much trash.
  - Not leveraging consistent atlas tree.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Refocus on 1–2 chosen mechanics.
  - Tighten loot filter.
  - Measure div/hour and adjust.

---

## KPIs and Milestones

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Div/hour**
- **Deaths per 10 maps**
- **Average map clear time**
- **XP/hour at high level**

### Milestones
