26. Reflection Prompts – Erotic Discipline Self-Inquiry

# Reflection Prompts – Erotic Discipline Self-Inquiry

## Objective
Deepen your awareness of progress, struggle, and transformation throughout the 90-day system. Use these questions in your journal during weekly reflections, post-orgasm moments, or after punishments.

---

## Weekly Prompts
Answer 2–3 each week:
- What did I resist the most this week?
- What did I complete even when I didn’t want to?
- How did my edging discipline change my mental focus?
- What physical signs of progress made me proud?
- What thoughts tempted me to break protocol?
- How did obedience change how I saw myself?
- What moment felt most erotic without orgasm?

---

## Post-Orgasm Prompts (Only When Permitted)
- Did I earn that orgasm?
- What did it cost to get here?
- Was it sacred, indulgent, obedient, or rebellious?
- What am I feeling right now — and why?
- Would I give it up again tomorrow?

---

## Punishment/Failure Prompts
- Why did I fail to complete the system?
- What pattern is repeating?
- What was I avoiding?
- How did it feel to be denied?
- What will I do differently next time?

---

## Monthly Transformation Prompts
- How has my relationship to edging changed?
- How has my view of my body evolved?
- Do I feel more erotic? More disciplined? More controlled?
- What’s become easier — and what’s still painful?
- How do I feel when I obey?
- How do I feel when I don’t?

---

## Affirmation Integration
After writing any entry, end with a line of mantra:
> “I am changing.”  
> “Obedience looks good on me.”  
> “Pleasure waits for discipline.”

**Final Instruction:**  
This journal is not for your ego — it’s for your surrender.  
Write honestly. No performance. Just truth.

**Reflect. Surrender. Write to become.**
