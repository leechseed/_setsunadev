It is true regardless of observers  \\\n2. It applies before, during, and after the story  \\\n3. It cannot be overridden by theme, character, or plot  \\\n\\\nIf a rule can be bent for drama, it is **not Layer 0**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Layer 0 Component Taxonomy\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 0.1 Existence & Ontology\\\n\\\n**Concern:** What exists and what does not.\\\n\\\n- **Entity Existence**\\\n  - What kinds of entities can exist (material, abstract, informational)\\\n- **Ontological Categories**\\\n  - Distinction between physical, mental, symbolic, systemic\\\n- **Boundary of Reality**\\\n  - What is real vs illusory vs imagined\\\n- **Continuity of Existence**\\\n  - Whether entities persist when unobserved\\\n- **Substrate Dependence**\\\n  - Whether existence requires a medium (matter, energy, data)\\\n- **Uniqueness vs Multiplicity**\\\n  - Whether identical entities can coexist\\\n- **Identity Persistence**\\\n  - What makes something the “same thing” over time\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 0.2 Truth Structure\\\n\\\n**Concern:** Whether truth exists independently of belief.\\\n\\\n- **Objective Truth**\\\n  - Facts that exist regardless of perception\\\n- **Subjective Experience**\\\n  - Perception without truth authority\\\n- **Knowability**\\\n  - Whether truth can be discovered\\\n- **Completeness of Knowledge**\\\n  - Whether total knowledge is possible\\\n- **Error Tolerance**\\\n  - Degree to which perception deviates from reality\\\n- **Truth Latency**\\\n  - Delay between fact and discovery\\\n- **Truth Decay**\\\n  - Whether truth degrades over time\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 0.3 Temporal Mechanics\\\n\\\n**Concern:** How time operates.\\\n\\\n- **Directionality**\\\n  - Forward-only, bidirectional, cyclical\\\n- **Continuity**\\\n  - Continuous vs discrete time\\\n- **Reversibility**\\\n  - Whether past states can be restored\\\n- **Temporal Persistence**\\\n  - Whether effects outlast causes\\\n- **Concurrency**\\\n  - Whether events can occur simultaneously\\\n- **Temporal Scope**\\\n  - Local vs global time effects\\\n- **Memory vs Time**\\\n  - Relationship between recollection and actuality\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 0.4 Causality Mechanics\\\n\\\n**Concern:** How effects arise.\\\n\\\n- **Cause–Effect Requirement**\\\n  - Whether every effect requires a cause\\\n- **Proportionality**\\\n  - Scale of cause relative to effect\\\n- **Determinism**\\\n  - Fixed outcomes vs branching possibilities\\\n- **Delayed Consequence**\\\n  - Time lag between cause and effect\\\n- **Chain Persistence**\\\n  - Whether causal chains can be broken\\\n- **Causal Locality**\\\n  - Whether causes must be adjacent\\\n- **Causal Closure**\\\n  - Whether outside forces can intervene\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 0.5 Probability & Uncertainty\\\n\\\n**Concern:** Role of randomness.\\\n\\\n- **Randomness Source**\\\n  - True randomness vs apparent randomness\\\n- **Risk Exposure**\\\n  - How uncertainty increases consequence spread\\\n- **Variance Bounds**\\\n  - Limits on outcome deviation\\\n- **Luck Influence**\\\n  - Whether chance favors or is indifferent\\\n- **Statistical Gravity**\\\n  - Tendency toward average outcomes\\\n- **Noise vs Signal**\\\n  - Distinguishing randomness from pattern\\\n- **Chance Constraints**\\\n  - What chance can affect—and what it cannot\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 0.6 Scale Behavior\\\n\\\n**Concern:** Whether rules change with magnitude.\\\n\\\n- **Scale Invariance**\\\n  - Same rules at all levels\\\n- **Emergent Effects**\\\n  - New behaviors without new rules\\\n- **Amplification**\\\n  - Small causes producing large effects\\\n- **Aggregation**\\\n  - Collective behavior vs individual behavior\\\n- **Threshold Effects**\\\n  - Points where behavior changes phase\\\n- **Systemic Load**\\\n  - Stress accumulation across scale\\\n- **Nonlinearity**\\\n  - Disproportionate outcomes without rule change\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 0.7 Permanence & Irreversibility\\\n\\\n**Concern:** What cannot be undone.\\\n\\\n- **Death Finality**\\\n  - Whether death is reversible\\\n- **Information Persistence**\\\n  - Whether knowledge can be erased\\\n- **Damage Permanence**\\\n  - Whether harm can be fully repaired\\\n- **State Locking**\\\n  - Points of no return\\\n- **Restoration Cost**\\\n  - Price of partial reversal\\\n- **Identity Loss**\\\n  - Irrecoverable self-change\\\n- **Historical Fixity**\\\n  - Whether past events can be altered\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 0.8 Entropy, Decay & Maintenance\\\n\\\n**Concern:** Long-term degradation.\\\n\\\n- **Entropy Rate**\\\n  - Speed of disorder increase\\\n- **Maintenance Requirement**\\\n  - Energy needed to sustain order\\\n- **System Fatigue**\\\n  - Wear through use\\\n- **Collapse Threshold**\\\n  - Point of failure\\\n- **Stasis Cost**\\\n  - Resources required to prevent decay\\\n- **Renewal Limits**\\\n  - Maximum possible restoration\\\n- **Asymmetry of Breakdown**\\\n  - Ease of destruction vs construction\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Component Interaction Rules\\\n\\\n- Components **stack**, they do not replace each other  \\\n- No component may contradict another  \\\n- Higher-layer logic must obey all components simultaneously  \\\n- Missing components default to **implicit assumptions** (dangerous)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## What Layer 0 Explicitly Excludes\\\n\\\nLayer 0 does **not** include:\\\n- Meaning or value judgments  \\\n- Justice or fairness  \\\n- Emotional truth  \\\n- Narrative payoff  \\\n- Character psychology  \\\n- Audience expectation  \\\n\\\nIf it answers “why this matters,” it is **Layer 1+**, not Layer 0.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Audit Checklist for Layer 0 Completeness\\\n\\\nUse this to verify closure:\\\n\\\n- Can reality function without characters?\\\n- Are irreversible events truly irreversible?\\\n- Does chance complicate but not resolve?\\\n- Do small and large actions obey the same rules?\\\n- Does decay require effort to prevent?\\\n\\\nIf any answer is “sometimes,” Layer 0 is underspecified.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Final Lock\\\n\\\n> **Layer 0 defines what is possible.  \\\nEverything else defines what is meaningful within those limits.**\\\n\\\nThe next entry should formalize **Layer 1 — Value & Meaning Logic**, building directly on these constraints.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":7109}]"
