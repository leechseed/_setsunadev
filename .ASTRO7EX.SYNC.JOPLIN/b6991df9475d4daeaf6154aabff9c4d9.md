## T1A01 — Basis & Purpose of Amateur Radio
**Correct Answer:** Advancing skills in the technical and communication phases of the radio art ✅

- **What this encodes:** Amateur radio exists to **advance the radio art**, improve **technical/communication skills**, support **emergency readiness**, and **foster goodwill**.
- **Why you study it:** It frames **why hams get spectrum** and privileges—experimentation, self-training, and public service.

---

## T1A02 — Who Regulates Amateur Radio (U.S.)
**Correct Answer:** The FCC ✅

- **What this encodes:** The **Federal Communications Commission** sets rules, issues licenses, manages spectrum, and enforces compliance.
- **Why you study it:** You’ll **file forms** (FRN, ULS), **read Part 97**, and **answer to** FCC rules if there’s a complaint.
- **Memory hook:** If it’s **U.S. radio law**, it’s **FCC**—not FEMA, not DHS.

---

## T1A03 — Phonetic Alphabet Requirement?
**Correct Answer:** Encouraged ✅

- **What this encodes:** Using a **standard phonetic alphabet** (e.g., NATO) is **recommended**, not mandatory.
- **Why you study it:** It **reduces errors** in weak/fast/noisy conditions, nets, DX, and contests.
- **Test trap:** It’s **not “required”**—even for emergencies or foreign contacts.

---

## T1A04 — How Many Operator/Primary Licenses?
**Correct Answer:** One ✅

- **What this encodes:** An individual may hold **one operator/primary station license** (one personal call sign).
- **Why you study it:** Avoid confusion over **multiple calls**; club licenses are **separate** and use a different call.
- **Practical tip:** Your license ties to **your own FRN**; don’t reuse someone else’s.

---

## T1A05 — Proof of Your License
**Correct Answer:** Listing in the FCC ULS database ✅

- **What this encodes:** The **ULS database** is the **authoritative** source for license **status** (active, canceled, revoked).
- **Why you study it:** Paper copies and VEC emails are **not legal proof**; ULS is.
- **Practical tip:** **Create/remember** your **FRN + password** to track applications and renewals.

---

## T1A06 — Definition: Beacon
**Correct Answer:** An amateur station transmitting for propagation/experimental activities ✅

- **What this encodes:** A **beacon** is a transmission **for observing propagation** or related experiments (often **continuous CW**).
- **Why you study it:** Tells you **what beacons are for** (not QSOs) and where you’ll **find them** (designated segments).
- **Use case:** Check **band openings** (Sporadic-E, tropo, F-layer) without coordinating with another op.

---

## T1A07 — Definition: Space Station vs Earth Station
**Correct Answer:** Amateur station located more than 50 km above Earth’s surface ✅

- **What this encodes:** **> 50 km = space station**; **≤ 50 km = earth station** (amateur service definitions).
- **Why you study it:** Different **rules/privileges/coordination** apply to space vs. earth stations (satellite ops).


---

## T1A08 — Who Recommends Repeater/Aux Channels
**Correct Answer:** Volunteer Frequency Coordinator recognized by local amateurs ✅

- **What this encodes:** **Local/regional coordinators** publish **band plans** and **repeater pairings** to prevent interference.
- **Why you study it:** You should **follow the local plan** to avoid stomping on repeater inputs/links.
- **Test trap:** It’s **not** assigned by the FCC or ITU—**it’s volunteer & local**.

---

## T1A09 — Who Selects the Frequency Coordinator
**Correct Answer:** Amateur operators in a local/regional area eligible for repeater/auxiliary stations ✅

- **What this encodes:** **The community** (repeater/aux-eligible ops) **recognizes/selects** their coordinator.
- **Why you study it:** Coordination is **bottom-up**, which explains **regional differences** in band plans.
- **Practical tip:** Find your **area’s coordinator** before installing or moving a repeater/aux link.

## T1A10 — Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES): WTF Is It?

**Question:** What is the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES)?  
**Choices (all are correct):**
- **A.** A radio service using amateur frequencies for emergency management or civil defense communications ✅  
- **B.** A radio service using amateur stations for emergency management or civil defense communications ✅  
- **C.** An emergency service using amateur operators certified by a civil defense organization as being enrolled in that organization ✅  
- **D.** **All these choices are correct** ✅  

- **What this encodes:** RACES is a **civil defense/emergency management** service defined in **Part 97.407** that uses **amateur frequencies, stations, and operators** when **authorized**.
- **Why you study it:** During certain **national emergencies**, amateur activity can be restricted—**RACES may still be permitted** under government direction.
- **How it works:** Ops must be **enrolled/authorized** by the **civil defense/emergency management** org; traffic is **limited to official emergency content**.
- **Contrast:** **RACES** (government-directed, statutory) vs **ARES** (ARRL-organized volunteer program).

---

## T1A11 — Willful Interference
**Correct Answer:** At no time ✅

- **What this encodes:** **Deliberate interference is never permitted**—no exceptions in Part 97.
- **Why you study it:** Violations can mean **notices, fines, license actions**, and equipment seizure.
- **Practical tip:** If you encounter QRM, **don’t engage**; **log, record**, and **report** through proper channels.
