# PUT FOCUS ON YOUR MAIN CHARACTER

Identify scenes where your **Main Character (MC)** needs more emphasis. Use the strategies below to ensure the audience’s attention consistently comes back to the MC.

---

### **1. Character Reacts**
- Even if the MC isn’t central to the scene’s activity, show their **reaction**.  
- Use facial expressions, gestures, or subtle actions.  
- The “camera” will always return to the MC this way.

---

### **2. Character Ends Scene**
- Conclude scenes with the MC’s **activity or emotion**.  
- Example: The scene ends on their laughter, silence, or a physical action that leaves a lasting impression.

---

### **3. Character Leads**
- In ensemble-heavy stories, especially in the **second half**, reframe scenes so the MC **appears to take the lead**.  
- Let them **make discoveries**, **generate ideas**, or **shift the group’s direction**.

---

### **4. Character Solves Problem**
- The MC doesn’t need to **save the day in every way**. That’s why there are helpers and supporting characters.  
- But ensure the MC delivers at least **one key move** that secures their agency in the story.
