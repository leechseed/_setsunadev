[Summary](#summary)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Overview\\\n\\\n**Narrative Pushbacks** are localized, non-scalable points of resistance that exist *within* a dominant system without threatening its continuity.  \\\nThey do not defeat the system.  \\\nThey do not reform it.  \\\nThey define what the system **cannot fully absorb**.\\\n\\\nPushbacks operate at the level of **character interiority and momentary choice**, not history, institutions, or outcomes.\\\n\\\nThey are not hope.  \\\nThey are **lucidity under coercion**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Relationship to Narrative Invariants\\\n\\\n- **Narrative Invariants** describe what the system *always does*.\\\n- **Narrative Pushbacks** describe what the system *can never completely take*.\\\n\\\nPushbacks do **not** negate invariants.  \\\nThey coexist asymmetrically.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Pushback 1 — Effectiveness Without Fairness\\\n\\\n### Statement\\\n**You don’t have to be fair to be effective.**\\\n\\\n### Core Function\\\nThis pushback breaks the assumption that moral compliance is required for impact.\\\n\\\nThe system dominates **fair, legible, procedural behavior**.  \\\nEffectiveness can still occur through:\\\n- Asymmetry\\\n- Timing\\\n- Unlegible action\\\n- Refusal to seek validation\\\n\\\n### Constraints\\\n- Does not guarantee success\\\n- Does not justify cruelty\\\n- Does not protect the actor from consequences\\\n\\\n### Narrative Use\\\n- Learned early through failure\\\n- Enables action without permission\\\n- Forces characters to abandon moral comfort\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Pushback 2 — The Mirror of Participation\\\n\\\n### Statement\\\n**Look at what you’re giving them.**\\\n\\\n### Core Function\\\nThis pushback forces self-recognition at the moment of participation.\\\n\\\nThe system does not merely consume bodies.  \\\nIt consumes:\\\n- Compliance\\\n- Performance\\\n- Narrative cooperation\\\n- Identity alignment\\\n\\\nThis pushback does not stop the sacrifice.  \\\nIt removes **anesthesia**.\\\n\\\n### Constraints\\\n- Awareness does not equal escape\\\n- Characters may recognize the cost and proceed anyway\\\n- Does not prevent instrumentalization\\\n\\\n### Narrative Use\\\n- Spoken as a warning, accusation, or last interruption\\\n- Functions as a “waking up” moment\\\n- Often ignored the first time it appears\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Pushback 3 — Interior Ownership of Choice\\\n\\\n### Statement\\\n**You know why you did it.**\\\n\\\n### Core Function\\\nThis pushback defines the one domain the system cannot access:  \\\n**the reason for an action at the moment it was chosen**.\\\n\\\nThe system controls:\\\n- Records\\\n- Legacy\\\n- Interpretation\\\n- Posthumous identity\\\n\\\nIt cannot retroactively alter **intent as experienced**.\\\n\\\n### Constraints\\\n- Entirely private\\\n- Non-transferable\\\n- Dies with the character\\\n- Offers no vindication\\\n\\\n### Narrative Use\\\n- Spoken quietly, rarely, and late\\\n- Functions as an afterimage of moral clarity\\\n- Persists even when the character is remembered as wrong or monstrous\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Structural Properties of Pushbacks\\\n\\\n- **Localized** — apply to individuals, not movements\\\n- **Non-scalable** — cannot be systematized\\\n- **Non-institutional** — cannot be encoded as policy\\\n- **Non-redemptive** — do not promise reward or rescue\\\n\\\nPushbacks create **friction**, not progress.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Design Guidance\\\n\\\n- Never allow all pushbacks to be spoken by the same character.\\\n- Pushbacks should be learned through loss, not instruction.\\\n- A pushback may be recognized too late to act on.\\\n- A character may violate a pushback knowingly.\\\n\\\nPushbacks are not rules for winning.  \\\nThey are rules for **remaining awake**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Summary\\\n\\\n**Narrative Pushbacks define what cannot be taken, even when everything else is.**\\\n\\\nThey do not weaken the system.  \\\nThey prevent total annihilation of interior meaning.\\\n\\\nThey are not remembered.  \\\nThey are not recorded.  \\\nThey are **experienced**.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4172}]"
