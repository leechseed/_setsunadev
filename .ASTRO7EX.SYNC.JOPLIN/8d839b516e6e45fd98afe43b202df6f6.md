Prioritize **touch/sound** (e.g., “suit zipper teeth,” “tannoy hiss,” “wet magnesium sparks”).\\\n\\\n2) **Object Lyric Deck** (6 min)  \\\n   Write 8 insert shots; each = **[object + action + subtext]**.  \\\n   *Ex:* “Cracked HUD film — peeled and re-taped — ‘keep going anyway.’”\\\n\\\n3) **Ritual Recipe** (5 min)  \\\n   6-step silent sequence for Vivian’s pre-run ritual. No faces until step 6.\\\n\\\n4) **Street Chorus Pairs** (6 min)  \\\n   5 two-shot pairs that **contrast** (haves vs have-nots; official vs DIY). End each pair with a **match cut** idea.\\\n\\\n5) **Choice Pause Board** (5 min)  \\\n   6 frames: 3 frames = ‘yes’ cost; 3 frames = ‘no’ cost. Only **externalized** visuals.\\\n\\\n6) **Sound Bed List** (5 min)  \\\n   12 diegetic sounds. Mark 3 for **J-cuts** into scenes (e.g., “Foghorn → cut to silent close-up”).\\\n\\\n7) **Survival Problem-Solve** (6 min)  \\\n   Write 5 tactile fixes Vivian performs solo (tape, wire, wedge, breathe). Each fix must **change odds** visibly.\\\n\\\n8) **Epilogue Stinger Cards** (5 min)  \\\n   4 images that imply MAXWING interest without dialogue (clipboard stamp, laser rangefinder dot, fisherman's slight nod, unseen camera blink).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 4) Pilot Beat Map (w/ Reflective Beats slotted)\\\n- **Cold Open (1–2 min):** Micro-disaster insert flurry → Vivian pops into frame (no VO).  \\\n- **Inciting Incident:** Ping of the AI core in incoming debris.  \\\n- **RB-1 Early Breather:** *Ritual Micro-Choreo* + *Street Chorus* (port rules shown, not told).  \\\n- **Break into Run:** She barges onto the crew; Fisherman watches.  \\\n- **Progress / Pressure:** Mudlark shadowing; port scanners twitch.  \\\n- **RB-2 Choice Pause:** *Choice Pause Tilt* as she senses they’ll cut her out.  \\\n- **Midpoint Betrayal:** Tether maneuver; crew bails; storm intensifies.  \\\n- **RB-3 Survival Montage:** *Survival Problem-Solve* + *Object Lyric* under alarms; zero speeches.  \\\n- **Climax:** She rides the storm, docks dirty, makes analog handoff.  \\\n- **Aftermath:** She spots the crew laughing, unbothered.  \\\n- **RB-4 Stinger (optional):** MAXWING tells—gloved stamp, Fisherman’s non-reaction, distant lens flare → cut.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 5) Camera & Edit Grammar (quick rules)\\\n- **Cuts:** Smash-in on touch; **match cuts** (circle → port hatch), **J-cuts** with tannoy/radio.  \\\n- **Lenses:** Close macro for ritual; 35–50mm for human scale; 85–100mm compression for isolation.  \\\n- **Motion:** FLCL-style whip/eyecatch only on transitions; LIS-style linger for Choice Pauses.  \\\n- **On-screen Text:** In-world stencils/stamps (no UI HUDs).  \\\n- **Color/Light:** Sodium vapor amber + arc-weld blues; storm = desat + harsh speculars.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 6) Music/Sound Design (diegetic first)\\\n- **Diegetic anchors:** Port radio (fisherman’s low-fi station), hull groans, cable twang, siren doppler.  \\\n- **Non-diegetic rules:** Reserve score for RB-2/3; keep motifs **percussive + breath + mechanical**.  \\\n- **Silence:** Use silence as a *decision spotlight* (freeze the port; hold on her eyes).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 7) World Depth Without Lore Dumps\\\n- **Every reflection beat adds one rule of place.**  \\\n  Examples to seed:\\\n  - “Paper keys beat air-gapped laptops here.”  \\\n  - “Port favors bribes wrapped in fish paper.”  \\\n  - “Tannoy lies; the tide table doesn’t.”  \\\n  - “Mudlarks mark territory with green wire ties.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 8) Throughline Hooks (quiet alignment)\\\n- **OS:** Show the *work* (tethers, burns, bribes).  \\\n- **MC:** Show constraint (paperless, ration caps) and the **attitude shift**.  \\\n- **IC (Fisherman):** 1–2 silent corrections (a head shake; a hand held; a line cut).  \\\n- **RS:** Mentor/ward reframed into “operators” by RB-3.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 9) Coffee-Break Scene Cards (printable template)\\\n**Card Title:** RB-[1–4] — [Type]  \\\n**Purpose (1 line):** [What truth/world rule does this reveal?]  \\\n**Image List (6–12):** [line-break list]  \\\n**Sound Bed (3):** [diegetic sources]  \\\n**Transition In/Out:** [match cut / J-cut / smash]  \\\n**No Dialogue Rule:** [y/n; if y, why]  \\\n**Throughline Tie:** [OS/MC/IC/RS]  \\\n**Beat Placement:** [page/time]\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 10) Minimal Writing Plan (six sprints)\\\n- Sprint 1: Image Bank 15 + Sound Bed List  \\\n- Sprint 2: RB-1 card  \\\n- Sprint 3: RB-2 card  \\\n- Sprint 4: RB-3 card  \\\n- Sprint 5: RB-4 card (optional)  \\\n- Sprint 6: Insert these into the pilot outline; write the adjacent 3–5 line **connector** beats only.\\\n\\\n> Result: a pilot that *moves* like a thriller but breathes like a memory—no lore dumps, maximum world texture.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6515}]"
