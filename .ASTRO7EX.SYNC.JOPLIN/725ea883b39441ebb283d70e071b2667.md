## 🧭 Overview

The Main vs. Impact Story Thematic Conflict in ASTRO7EX is centered around the opposition of **Sense of Self** and **State of Being**. This is not merely a difference in perception—it is a war between Vivian’s *idealized self-definition* and the MODS’ *ontological absolutism*. Their relationship is strained not by argument, but by the inability to agree on the most fundamental question: *What is identity?*

This report outlines how this conflict manifests across their interactions and in the broader narrative, contrasting the *changeable story of who we are* against the *unchanging truth of what we are*.

## 🧾 Definitions – Sense of Self vs. State of Being

### **Sense of Self**

* **Definition**: One’s perception of oneself. Mutable, shaped by memory, story, trauma, and hope.
* **Vivian’s Anchor**: Her resistance to being reduced to roles imposed by others—soldier, thief, monster. She insists she is still *becoming*.

### **State of Being**

* **Definition**: One’s true nature. Unchanging, mechanical, inherent.
* **MODS’ Nature**: They do not have identity—only structure. Their being is not expressive but recursive. They reflect what *is*, not what *could be*.

---

## 🧱 Structural Theory – Role of the Thematic Conflict

In Dramatica, the **Issue vs. Counterpoint** creates the emotional and philosophical core of the **M/I Throughline**. This conflict is not abstract—it is rendered in the tension between characters who must coexist but cannot reconcile their worldviews.

* The **Main Character** asserts that *identity can be chosen*.
* The **Impact Character** asserts that *identity is irrelevant; nature persists*.

This dichotomy deepens every interaction between Vivian and the MODS and informs the larger question of whether transformation is possible or illusionary.

## 🌑 ASTRO7EX Expression – Conflict in the Vivian/MODS Relationship

### **Vivian**

* Wrestles with the fear that her self-perception is **delusional**.
* Her past (MAXWING), her training, her violence—they suggest she is *not a person with a future*, but a machine left behind.
* Her **sense of self** is **aspirational**: it seeks freedom, authorship, and reclamation.

### **MODS**

* They exist outside the idea of identity.
* Their **state of being** is fixed: they are interfaces, scripts, fallback logic.
* They resist *selfhood* because they do not need it. They do not ask, *“Who am I?”*—they only query inputs.

### **Relationship Expression**

* When Vivian screams: *“I am not what you made me.”*
  The MODS respond: *“That distinction is not operationally valid.”*
* The relationship is **non-dialogic**—Vivian is desperate to be seen, while the MODS are incapable of seeing.

This asymmetry creates a deeply emotional conflict: a woman pleading for narrative facing a structure that refuses to participate in story.

## 🧠 Thematic Conversations – Auxiliary Cast as Mirrors

ASTRO7EX uses side characters to explore this theme without placing the burden solely on Vivian or the MODS.

* **Nacho (Guardian)** offers the possibility that identity can be **constructed with dignity**, through acts of choice and loyalty.
* **Fiona (Contagonist)** seduces Vivian with the promise that selfhood can be **abandoned** in exchange for comfort and numbness.
* **Myrtle (Sidekick)** reflects back the possibility that **true nature** might be a haunted echo—and the choice is whether to harmonize with it or override it.

These characters allow the audience to see the *Sense of Self vs. State of Being* debate from multiple philosophical and emotional angles.

## 🔍 Thematic Analysis – Literary and Mythological Frames

### 🧠 **Harold Bloom – The Anxiety of Inheritance**

* Vivian resists the past but is always dragged back into it.
* The MODS are not a father figure—they are the **total archive**, the embodiment of past determinism.

### 📚 **Joseph Campbell – Shadow and Apotheosis**

* The MODS are not adversaries but *shadows*.
* Facing them is not victory—it is **admission** of self.
* The hero’s journey fails if she **cannot accept the horror of what she is**.

### 📺 **2000s Anime Trope Lens**

* Like *Ergo Proxy*, *Texhnolyze*, or *RahXephon*, identity is fluid, but consequence is not.
* Vivian mirrors protagonists who hallucinate meaning, only to crash into truth.

### 🎭 **Robert McKee – Story’s Argument**

* In ASTRO7EX, the story *argues against* the idea that perception alone defines reality.
* It posits: *“What you are”* will always leak through *“who you say you are.”*

## 📊 Spectrum Placement – Value Judgment

> **Where does ASTRO7EX fall on the Sense of Self vs. State of Being spectrum?**

**Position:** 6 out of 21 → *Slightly favors Sense of Self*

### Interpretation:

* While the narrative respects the **reality** of State of Being, it still holds out **hope** that the self can matter.
* Vivian does not overcome her nature—but she insists on defining its meaning.
* The **conflict remains unresolved**—but the story tilts gently toward the **importance of self-perception**, even in the face of unyielding truth.

## 🧩 Summary – How Conflict is Thematized in ASTRO7EX

The conflict between *Sense of Self* and *State of Being* defines the emotional landscape of ASTRO7EX. Vivian, haunted by the truth of what she was made to do, insists that her story can still be hers. The MODS, devoid of story, deny that such meaning exists.

Their relationship never achieves understanding—but that *lack of resolution* is the point. In ASTRO7EX, the world doesn’t answer whether we are what we are—or what we believe. It only shows us what happens when the two ideas collide.

> **She screams to be seen.
> They return only system prompts.
> In that silence, we feel the conflict.**
