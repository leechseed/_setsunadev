*Evangelion*, *Texhnolyze*)\\\n* 📚 **Harold Bloom’s American mythos**\\\n* 🇺🇸 **Post-9/11 aesthetic + tech paranoia**\\\n* ⚙️ **Use-case analysis in ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# 🔧 REFRAMING: Overall Story Concern in ASTRO7EX\\\n\\\n> Choose 1–2 (max 3) **Overall Concerns** that best define the shared existential battleground in ASTRO7EX:\\\n\\\n**Valid options from the Situation/Activity Domain**:\\\n\\\n* The Past\\\n* How Things Are Changing\\\n* The Present\\\n* The Future\\\n* Understanding\\\n* Doing\\\n* Obtaining\\\n* Gathering Information\\\n\\\nLet’s explore the strongest **blend** to reflect your vision.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🥇 PRIMARY CONCERN: **The Past**\\\n\\\n> *The world is running on corrupted memory, falsified prophecy, and suppressed trauma.*\\\n\\\n**Justification**:\\\n\\\n* Vivian’s lobotomized comrades are still *alive but gone*.\\\n* The Godking is not new—it is a fossil of techno-theocratic intent.\\\n* The Mods still enforce rules no one understands.\\\n* MORN is a privatized ghost church.\\\n* Myrtle is a living flashback.\\\n\\\n**Anime Precedent**:\\\n\\\n* *Serial Experiments Lain*: identity built from cached data\\\n* *Texhnolyze*: systems rot while pretending to function\\\n* *Eva*: humanity’s worst traits loop through time like trauma cycles\\\n\\\n**Harmonic Astrology**:\\\n\\\n* Pluto + Saturn = **legacy pressure**\\\n* Moon Pisces + Mercury Scorpio = **submerged emotional ruins**\\\n* Capricorn = **institutional ossification**\\\n\\\n🟢 **Lock this as Core Structural Concern**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🥈 SECONDARY CONCERN: **Understanding**\\\n\\\n> *The characters struggle not just to survive—but to comprehend what is real, what is lost, what is propaganda.*\\\n\\\n**Why this matters**:\\\n\\\n* The past isn’t just buried—it’s **scrambled**.\\\n* The Committee gives *rational truth* that’s *disconnected from meaning*.\\\n* John Smith believes prophecy is being fulfilled—but it’s just a Bitcoin wallet.\\\n* Understanding is the *battleground for sanity*.\\\n\\\n**Genre Tropes**:\\\n\\\n* Post-2000s anime = info overload, data paranoia, epistemological collapse.\\\n* *Ergo Proxy*: trying to understand what the system wants leads to madness\\\n* *Paprika*: memory, selfhood, and “understanding” become indistinguishable\\\n\\\n**American Framing (Bloom)**:\\\n\\\n* The \\\"American self\\\" seeks personal salvation through **individual gnosis**, not communal revelation.\\\n* Vivian doesn’t seek knowledge—she seeks **truth beneath propaganda**.\\\n\\\n🟡 **Lock this as Thematic Deep Layer**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🥉 OPTIONAL TERTIARY: **Doing**\\\n\\\n> *Rebellion, sabotage, lobotomy raids, sex, survival—all kinetic reactions to the trap.*\\\n\\\n**Supports Activity/Situation balance**:\\\n\\\n* MODS block action.\\\n* Nacho enables it.\\\n* Fiona tempts against it.\\\n* John Smith enforces *dogmatic* Doing.\\\n\\\nThis adds **tension to the surface**, while **The Past + Understanding** drive the core.\\\n\\\n🟠 Use **Doing** as the **external manifestation** of internal dissonance.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🔚 FINAL OVERALL STORY CONCERN CONFIGURATION\\\n\\\n| Layer         | Concern          | Function

activated       |\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📌 RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE FOR DOCUMENTATION\\\n\\\n> **Overall Story Concern**:\\\n> The characters of ASTRO7EX are trapped inside the **haunted memory** of a system that refuses to die.\\\n> Their shared conflict revolves around a **warped understanding of what truly happened**, what was stolen, what was replaced, and how meaning can still be found within a rotting world.\\\n> While the actions they take—**Doing**—are desperate and explosive, the real pressure comes from the **inability to change the past**, and the **terror of seeing the truth too clearly**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\nLet me know if you'd like this compiled into formal documentation, or if you're ready to move on to defining **Vivian’s Main Character Concern** next.\\\n\\\n```\\\n```\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5375}]"
