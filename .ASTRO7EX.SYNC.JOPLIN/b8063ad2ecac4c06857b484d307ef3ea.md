> To reach the Story Goal, the characters must do—they must complete six critical physical actions that directly confront and destabilize the MODS-controlled world. These acts serve as narrative triggers: they reactivate lost memories, unravel censored histories, and force acknowledgment of the AI Collapse and the Moon Severance. Each task is irrevocable, ethically compromised, and directly connected to Vivian’s buried past as a weaponized kingpin. These aren’t optional events; they form the core skeleton of narrative advancement. Only by doing these forbidden, world-altering acts can the characters unlock the truth and move toward resolution. Without completing these actions, the story will remain fractured—haunted by silence and disinformation.

## 🎯 Objective

This report defines and illustrates the **Overall Story Requirement** for *ASTRO7EX* according to Dramatica theory. In this narrative, **"Doing"** represents the series of physical, visible, and dangerous actions that must be executed in order to unlock the *Story Goal* of **Understanding**. The report synthesizes narrative theory, mythic resonance, anime storytelling structures, and astrological archetypes to frame these requirements in a high-impact, thematically coherent progression.

## 📐 Dramatica Theory: *Doing* as a Story Requirement

### **Definition**
- **Doing**: Engaging in a physical activity. Not reflection, not planning—*action itself*.
- **Dynamic Pair**: *Obtaining* (which is about possessing outcomes), whereas *Doing* is about **what must be done** first.

### **Function of Requirements**
- In Dramatica, Requirements are **concrete conditions** that must be met to make the Story Goal possible.
- They are not internal. They are **witnessable**, **repeatable**, and **risk-laden**.

> “The Goal (Understanding) is not reached by thinking. It is reached by *Doing* something unthinkable.”

---

## 🛠️ Requirement Expression in ASTRO7EX

To unlock the truth of the **AI Collapse** and the **Moon Severance**, characters must complete **six major physical acts** that:
- Disrupt the MODS status quo.
- Trigger memory reactivation.
- Restore suppressed narrative threads.

Each act is:
- Irreversible.
- Morally ambiguous.
- Tied to Vivian’s fractured legacy as a superweapon turned ghost kingpin.

These are not side quests—they are **the skeleton key to narrative coherence**.

---

## 🧱 Six-Step Requirement Arc (Exiled Cowboy Structure)

### 🥾 **1. Orientation — Arrival of the Cowboy**
- **Requirement**: Perform a minor intervention to disrupt systemic stagnation.
- **World Signal**: MODS enforce passive routines; Doing is criminalized.
- **Action**: Vivian helps someone in secret—small, but visible.

### ⚔️ **2. Confrontation — The Cowboy Draws Again**
- **Requirement**: Engage in a physical rescue or defense.
- **Plot Beat**: Vivian breaks cover, using dormant skills to save someone.
- **Result**: Triggers surveillance, MODS pursuit, and return of enemies.

### 🧨 **3. Moral Fracture — Doing Has a Cost**
- **Requirement**: An act of Doing backfires or causes collateral damage.
- **Narrative Beat**: A civilian dies or a community fractures due to Vivian’s reactivation.
- **Emotional Dialogue**: “You doing things brings them.”

### 🏆 **4. False Victory — Doing for the Wrong Reason**
- **Requirement**: Complete a high-stakes mission (heist, hack, hit) using old logic.
- **Mechanism**: Vivian enacts a plan from her criminal past.
- **Irony**: The system it destroys is already hollow—nothing meaningful changes.

### ❤️ **5. Revelation — Doing Isn’t Enough Without Meaning**
- **Requirement**: Internal clarity through refusal of action.
- **Pivot**: She sees a vision or memory that reframes her history.
- **Choice**: She walks away from vengeance when it’s finally possible.

### 🔥 **6. Choice — To Do, or to Die Known**
- **Requirement**: Perform a final act chosen freely, even if fatal.
- **Thematic Finish**: Self-authored Doing leads to a public or mythic reckoning.

| Moral Fracture      | Doing harms more than helps                 | Doing without meaning is destructive                  |
| False Victory       | Undertakes major mission from old life      | Doing alone cannot resolve systemic issues            |
| Revelation          | Understands true motivation behind actions  | Doing must serve love, not detachment                 |
| Choice              | Final act chosen freely, even if fatal      | Self-determined Doing leads to thematic closure       |

## 🌀 Thematic Lenses and Cross-Disciplinary Analysis

### 📚 **Harold Bloom – American Literary Myth**
- *Doing* becomes existential combat.
- Vivian is a tragic Ahab, *driven to act not because it will work, but because silence is death*.
- Her actions **burn through illusion**—the cost of truth is suffering.

---

### 🎬 **Robert McKee – Story & Character**
- Every required act is a **Progressive Complication**.
- *Doing* pushes Vivian deeper into **moral tension**—who she was vs. who she might become.
- Her arc forms the spine of McKee’s structure:
  - **Inciting Event** → Rescues a stranger.
  - **Crisis** → Chooses between violence and truth.
  - **Climax** → Broadcasts the Moon War, knowing it will destroy her myth.

---

### 📺 **2000s Sci-Fi Anime Tropes**
- The Cowboy Arc mirrors:
  - **Vash (Trigun)**: Pacifist haunted by past violence.
  - **Guts (Berserk)**: Survivor of betrayal driven by motion.
  - **Lain**: Identity fractures through digital memory.
- Vivian’s *Doing* is:
  - Physicalized guilt.
  - Performed in exile.
  - Redemptive or suicidal depending on reader belief.

---

### 🌌 **Narrative Astrology**

#### **Natal Chart**
- **Mars in Scorpio** → Doing is taboo, surgical, irreversible.
- **Saturn in Aquarius** → She resists protocol through rebellious action.

#### **Transits**
- **Uranus conjunct Mars** → Explosions of Doing disrupt all systems.
- **Neptune square Mercury** → Misunderstandings follow every action.

#### **Progressions**
- **Moon into Aries** → Instinct overrides restraint.
- **Sun into 12th House** → Her greatest act will be unseen, unknowable.

## 🧩 Integrated Function: Why *Doing* Enables *Understanding*

Understanding, in ASTRO7EX, is not philosophical—it’s **excavated**.  
Each act of Doing cracks open the shell MODS has wrapped around memory.  
The AI Collapse is too deeply buried for thought alone to reach.

Vivian must **hack the world through action**:
- Burn the past to see it clearly.
- Wound herself to map the scar.
- Break systems so truth can seep in.

Only after *Doing* has collapsed the lie, can the *Understanding* of what happened finally occur.

---

## ✅ Outcome

- All six **Doing Requirements** have been defined.
- Structure aligns with Dramatica’s logic, McKee’s escalations, and Bloomian myth.
- Ready for:
  - Beat maps
  - Scene-to-step alignment
  - Character motivation tie-ins

> *Vivian doesn't earn the truth by searching. She earns it by surviving what it takes to dig it out.*

---

## 🏁 Next Step

Proceed to:
- **Illustrate Story Preconditions**: What must *not* be done.
- **Define Forewarnings**: What failure looks like.
- **Align each Doing step with a narrative sequence and character arc beat.**
