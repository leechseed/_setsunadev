# Add Personality

Working ten minutes at a time, use word choice to adjust the tone of your scenes and create the right mood.

---

### **Tone Options**

1. **Comedy**  
   Keep your descriptions straightforward, almost dry. Let the humor add the color.  

2. **Thriller**  
   Work down the page, building suspense moment by moment.  

3. **Horror**  
   Try out some poetry in your most horrific moments. It’ll make your scenes even creepier.  

4. **Sci-Fi**  
   Work in descriptions of futuristic devices and new rules as they actually impact the story.  

5. **Period Piece**  
   Point to the emotional undercurrent in your scenes with loaded looks and whispered moments.  

6. **Superhero**  
   Give your scenes comic-book color by punctuating sounds and action moments.  

7. **Romance**  
   Work emotion into action. Don’t feel you have to get too flowery. (They may stare a moment too long, but that stare doesn’t have to “smolder.”)
