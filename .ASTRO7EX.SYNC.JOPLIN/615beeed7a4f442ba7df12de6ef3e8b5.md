IC Approach


## **Do-er vs. Be-er: Vivian vs. MODS in ASTRO7EX**

### **1. Crisis in the Lunar Bazaar**

* **Vivian (Do-er)**:
  A street-level data courier double-crosses her. Vivian reacts instantly — vaulting across stalls, cutting the crowd with her blade, and physically cornering the target before thinking about consequences.
* **MODS (Be-er)**:
  Doesn’t move at all. While Vivian chases, MODS issues a system-wide protocol freeze that reclassifies the courier as "non-operational" in the network, effectively deleting their access and leverage without leaving the desk.

**Conflict**: Vivian burns time and makes enemies in the physical world; MODS rewrites the environment from within, making her chase irrelevant.

---

### **2. The Committee Ultimatum**

* **Vivian (Do-er)**:
  She storms the chamber during session, physically placing the stolen DHR countdown core in front of The Committee to force a decision.
* **MODS (Be-er)**:
  Responds by delaying the vote indefinitely — not by arguing, but by inserting contradictory procedural amendments into the record until the matter becomes impossible to act on without reclassifying the entire agenda.

**Conflict**: Vivian believes you *force* resolution by making it impossible to ignore; MODS believes you *prevent* resolution by making it impossible to process.

---

### **3. Betrayal on the Moon’s Darkside**

* **Vivian (Do-er)**:
  Upon learning the MODS fed her false coordinates, she immediately assembles a strike team, hacks a mining crawler, and physically infiltrates the location to verify.
* **MODS (Be-er)**:
  Instead of confronting her or defending their actions, they quietly alter the archival record so that the “real” coordinates always matched the false ones. To MODS, the betrayal never happened because they internally realigned the system’s “truth.”

**Conflict**: Vivian *proves* reality by going there; MODS *controls* reality by redefining it.

---

### **4. The Prophets of Rot Broadcast**

* **Vivian (Do-er)**:
  She hijacks an orbital relay to broadcast the unedited truth about AN7L’s privatization by MORN.
* **MODS (Be-er)**:
  They do not counter-broadcast or jam her signal. Instead, they quietly adjust key identity-flag protocols so that anyone who watched her broadcast now has their access credentials invalidated, making her message irrelevant because the audience no longer has a voice in the system.

**Conflict**: Vivian thinks information changes the world; MODS thinks *context* changes the world — and they control context.

---

### **5. Personal Confrontation**

* **Vivian (Do-er)**:
  In a rare face-to-face encounter, she throws the encrypted AN7L shard onto the table and dares MODS to open it in front of her.
* **MODS (Be-er)**:
  Without touching the shard, they calmly explain that her possession of it is now illegal under a new directive — effectively shifting the *meaning* of the object so the act of opening it is moot.

**Conflict**: Vivian tries to *force* a moment; MODS tries to *defuse* the moment by reframing it.

If you want, I can **map these five moments to the Dramatica Plot Progression** so you can see exactly how the **Do-er / Be-er conflict** escalates across *ASTRO7EX*. That would tie them into the canonical Signposts and Journeys we’ve already built. That way they’re not just cool examples but structural beats.

Do you want me to make that mapping next?
