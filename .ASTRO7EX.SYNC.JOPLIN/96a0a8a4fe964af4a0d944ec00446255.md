Biggest lever for first read.  \\\n- **Saturation** *(UI tools term)* → Intensity of color from gray to vivid.  \\\n- **Chroma** *(perceptual)* → The perceived strength of a color relative to a similarly illuminated gray. Close to saturation; treat as “how punchy it feels.”  \\\n- **Lightness / Luma / Luminance** → Different models of “how bright it looks.” Tool UIs mix these; don’t obsess—use grayscale previews to judge value.  \\\n- **Temperature** → Warm (reds/oranges/yellows) vs cool (blues/cyans). Warm feels nearer; cool recedes (usually).  \\\n- **Gamut** → The range of colors a device/space can show (sRGB, Display P3, Adobe RGB, CMYK).  \\\n- **Simultaneous Contrast** → A color shifts appearance based on neighbors (blue looks more vibrant next to orange, etc.).  \\\n- **Edge Sharpness** → Abruptness of transitions. Hard edges attract; soft edges recede.  \\\n- **Color Constancy** → The brain auto-corrects lighting; cameras do not. Fix white balance.  \\\n- **Metamerism** → Two swatches match under one light but not another. Beware for print.  \\\n- **Helmholtz–Kohlrausch Effect** → Very saturated colors can *feel* brighter than their measured luminance. Translation: saturation adds **weight**.\\\n\\\n> Tattoo this: **Value first. Edge second. Color third.** Color *amplifies* weight; it is not a substitute for value design.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## How to Use This Guide\\\n- **Lock value** structure in grayscale, then layer **temperature** and **saturation** to steer attention.  \\\n- Use **one dominant palette idea** (analogous, complementary, etc.). Don’t mix schemes.  \\\n- Limit **hot accents** to where the story needs them—usually the focal and stepping stones.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Attention Physics: What Actually Pulls the Eye\\\nPerceptual “weight” increases with:\\\n\\\n1. **Value contrast** (biggest jump wins)\\\n2. **Edge sharpness** (crisper = heavier)\\\n3. **Saturation/chroma** (punchier = heavier)\\\n4. **Warmth** (warm > cool, generally)\\\n5. **Detail/micro-contrast** (texture attracts)\\\n6. **Faces/text/symbols** (semantic magnets)\\\n7. **Area & isolation** (big solitary patches weigh more)\\\n\\\n**Heuristic (rough mental math)**  \\\n`Weight ≈ Area × (ValueFactor × EdgeFactor × SaturationFactor × WarmthFactor × DetailFactor)`  \\\nUse it to decide if a small red accent can balance a large dull mass (it often can).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Contrast Playbook (The Useful Ones)\\\nForget the full art-school list—here are the ones you’ll actually use and how:\\\n\\\n- **Light–Dark (Value) Contrast**  \\\n  - Make the focal the highest value jump (light-on-dark or dark-on-light).\\\n\\\n- **Warm–Cool Contrast**  \\\n  - Warm focal in a cool field = instant pull. Reverse for icy stories.\\\n\\\n- **Complementary Contrast (Opposites on the wheel)**  \\\n  - Red/green, blue/orange, yellow/purple. Use **one** pair; keep the field muted.\\\n\\\n- **Saturation Contrast**  \\\n  - One saturated accent in a desaturated world = spotlight. Don’t pepper saturation everywhere.\\\n\\\n- **Contrast of Proportion (Color “extension”)**  \\\n  - Small amount of hot hue can balance a sea of calm hue. E.g., 5% red vs 95% desaturated cyan.\\\n\\\n- **Simultaneous Contrast (Context shift)**  \\\n  - Surround a hue with its near-complement to intensify it (orange wall makes blue product pop).\\\n\\\n> Stack two contrasts at the focal (e.g., value + saturation). Save the third for the final punch if needed.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Palette Architecture (Dominant / Subdominant / Accent)\\\n- **Dominant (≈60%)** → Neutral or softly colored field (pick a temperature).  \\\n- **Subdominant (≈30%)** → Harmonizing hue with lower saturation or value contrast.  \\\n- **Accent (≈10% → often 3–5%)** → The saturated, warm or high-contrast spike at the focal.\\\n\\\n**Rules**\\\n- Keep accent **local** and **unique**. If everything’s an accent, nothing is.  \\\n- Echo the accent **tiny** elsewhere as stepping stones (micro-doses only).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Temperature & Atmosphere (Warm/Cool Control)\\\n- **Depth**: Warm near, cool far (pairs well with aerial perspective).  \\\n- **Skin**: Keep undertones warm-neutral; let background run cooler.  \\\n- **Metal/Glass**: Neutral to cool with **warm highlights** for snap.  \\\n- **Night**: Cool base with **select warm pools** (windows, fires, skin).\\\n\\\n**White Balance Discipline**\\\n- Pick a key white balance and stick to it across a sequence. Mixed lighting = mud unless motivated.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Saturation, Chroma & Restraint\\\n- Start **desaturated**; add saturation **only** at the focal and stepping stones.  \\\n- Prefer **Vibrance** (protects skin/low-sat hues) over blunt Saturation sliders.  \\\n- Watch channel clipping—high sat + high value = ugly banding on export.\\\n\\\n**Helmholtz–Kohlrausch Reality Check**  \\\n- Ultra-saturated patches *feel* bright; don’t let them hijack value hierarchy. If they do, lower saturation or lower edges there.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Value–Color Interlock (Build in B/W, Win in Color)\\\n- Build a **3-value Notan** first (black/gray/white).  \\\n- Map hues **on top** of established values:  \\\n  - Light area can be warm or cool—just keep it **light**.  \\\n  - Dark area can host saturated color—just keep it **dark**.\\\n\\\n**Value-Locked Palettes**\\\n- Monochrome value plan with hue variation = stable, stylish.  \\\n- If color breaks the read in grayscale, **your values are wrong**. Fix those before hue tweaks.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Harmony Schemes that Actually Ship\\\n- **Monochrome** → One hue, value/sat variations. Calm, brandable.  \\\n- **Analogous (2–3 neighbors)** → Cohesive, low conflict; use complementary accent sparingly.  \\\n- **Complementary** → One hue muted for field, the other as accent. Don’t 50/50 it.  \\\n- **Split Complementary** → Safer, more flexible complementary (e.g., blue vs red–orange & yellow–orange).  \\\n- **Triadic (three evenly spaced hues)** → Keep two muted, one accented, or it turns into a circus.  \\\n- **Tetradic (double complementary)** → Only if you’re disciplined. Lock values first, assign roles (dominant/sub/accents).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Material & Subject Recipes\\\n- **Skin (all tones)**: Value first; saturation restrained. Warm mids, neutral shadows, *select* cool in bounce/ambient.  \\\n- **Foliage**: Avoid neon green. Push toward warm sunlight in lights, cooler blue-greens in shade.  \\\n- **Sky/Water**: Gradient is king (value & temperature). Warm near horizon, cooler zenith; reflections darker than sky.  \\\n- **Metal**: Big value swings, tight speculars; let environment color drive the metal, not a spray of white.  \\\n- **Fire/Neon**: Saturation doomsday—put it in **value-appropriate** range and kill competing edges nearby.  \\\n- **UI CTA Buttons**: Accent color reserved; ensure value contrast against background and text.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Genre Shortcuts (Color by Context)\\\n- **Landscape**: Cool distance, warm foreground accents; keep saturation on a leash.  \\\n- **Portrait**: Skin priority; background cooler/duller; one wardrobe color gets to sing.  \\\n- **Product**: Neutral field; brand color as accent; speculars controlled; label legibility beats everything.  \\\n- **Architecture**: Planar neutrals; temperature contrast via practicals/daylight.  \\\n- **Concept/Key Art**: Two-hue story max + accent; color script across images for continuity.  \\\n- **UI/UX**: Neutral base, one accent family; reserve red for errors/warnings or it loses meaning.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Accessibility & Readability (Don’t Fail Humans)\\\n- **Text over background**: Aim for strong **value contrast**—don’t rely on hue difference.  \\\n- Body text should meet typical contrast targets (rule of thumb: dark text on light or vice versa; avoid mid-on-mid).  \\\n- **Color isn’t data**: Encode with shape/position/labels too. Assume some users can’t see your chosen red–green contrast.  \\\n- Test with **grayscale** and common color-vision filters (protan/deutan).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Diagnostics & Stress Tests\\\n- **Grayscale Toggle** → Does the focal still win? If not, your color is faking it.  \\\n- **Saturation Kill** → Drop global saturation to 0; should still read.  \\\n- **Accent Budget** → Count accents. More than 1–2 real accents? You’re leaking attention.  \\\n- **Corner Audit** → Any bright/saturated corners? Kill or redirect.  \\\n- **Heat Map Sketch** → Circle the three heaviest color weights. Do they land where you wanted?  \\\n- **White Balance Sweep** → Warm and cool the whole frame ±1000K (or equivalent). Pick one and stick with it.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Exercises That Build Skill Fast\\\n1. **Gray-First Paint**  \\\n   - Fully render in grayscale; colorize with Gradient Map/Color layers. Keep the read identical.\\\n\\\n2. **Accent Discipline**  \\\n   - One image, allow **only 5%** of pixels to exceed a saturation threshold. Place them at the focal.\\\n\\\n3. **Warm–Cool Ramps**  \\\n   - Paint a still life twice: warm key/cool fill vs cool key/warm fill. Compare depth and mood.\\\n\\\n4. **Harmony Triplet**  \\\n   - Ship the same comp as Analogous, Complementary, and Triadic. Keep values constant; judge speed of read.\\\n\\\n5. **Brand Safe**  \\\n   - Build a UI with a neutral base and **one** accent family. Add a second accent and watch the CTA die. Remove it.\\\n\\\n6. **Material Studies**  \\\n   - Metal, glass, skin, foliage—four 30-minute studies focused on value swings and controlled speculars.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)\\\n- **Color-Only Contrast** → Dies in B/W.  \\\n  *Cure*: Rebuild value hierarchy; color last.\\\n\\\n- **Too Many Hues** → Noise.  \\\n  *Cure*: Pick a scheme; mute the field; one accent.\\\n\\\n- **Over-Saturation** → Cheap look, banding, lost form.  \\\n  *Cure*: Pull back sat, push value contrast and edges at the focal.\\\n\\\n- **Mixed White Balance** → Mud.  \\\n  *Cure*: Pick a key WB; neutralize or lean intentionally.\\\n\\\n- **Hot Corners** → Leaks.  \\\n  *Cure*: Desaturate/darken corners; use blockers/vignettes.\\\n\\\n- **Red Everywhere** → Alarm fatigue.  \\\n  *Cure*: Reserve red for error/alert or single hero accent.\\\n\\\n- **CMYK Surprise** → Print looks dull.  \\\n  *Cure*: Soft proof CMYK, constrain gamut, don’t rely on neon RGB.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Workflow & Setup (Profiles, Export, Tools)\\\n- **Work Space**: Use **sRGB** for web unless you *know* your pipeline supports Display P3. For print, soft-proof the target **CMYK ICC**.  \\\n- **Monitor**: Calibrate. If you won’t, accept that your color decisions are guesses.  \\\n- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit for heavy grading to avoid banding; dither on export if needed.  \\\n- **White Balance**: Shoot a gray card or key on a known neutral; sync WB across sets.  \\\n- **Tools**:  \\\n  - **Gradient Map / Selective Color / Curves** > global Saturation sledgehammer.  \\\n  - **LAB** tweaks for targeted color without wrecking value (advanced; use carefully).  \\\n  - **LUTs**: Use as seasoning, not a crutch; always re-check values.  \\\n- **Export**: Embed profile; for web, convert to sRGB; test on a phone and a cheap laptop (worst-case reality).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Cheat Sheet Summary\\\n- **Value wins.** If it fails in grayscale, fix values first.  \\\n- **Limit accents.** One saturated/warm accent near the focal beats ten scattered pops.  \\\n- **Control temperature.** Warm near/cool far is depth on a platter.  \\\n- **Build a palette.** Dominant 60% + Sub 30% + Accent ≤10%.  \\\n- **Protect edges.** Hard at the focal, soft elsewhere—color won’t save sloppy edges.  \\\n- **Export sanely.** sRGB for web, proof CMYK for print, calibrate or accept roulette.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Extended Glossary\\\n- **Accent (Color)** → A small, high-saturation or high-contrast color used to pull attention.  \\\n- **Analogous** → Neighboring hues on the wheel; cohesive with low conflict.  \\\n- **Chroma** → Perceived color strength; similar to saturation but rooted in human vision models.  \\\n- **Complementary** → Opposite hues; high tension—use one as field, the other as accent.  \\\n- **Gamut** → The color range a device/profile can reproduce (sRGB < P3 < AdobeRGB; CMYK smaller but print-ink dependent).  \\\n- **Gradient Map** → Maps values to a color ramp; powerful for keeping value–color alignment.  \\\n- **Lightness/Luminance/Luma** → Different measures of brightness (model-dependent). Use grayscale previews to judge composition.  \\\n- **Metamerism** → Matches under one light fail under another; print trap.  \\\n- **Monochrome** → Single hue with value/saturation variation.  \\\n- **Notan** → 2–3 value abstraction that defines read before color.  \\\n- **Simultaneous Contrast** → Colors alter each other’s appearance when adjacent.  \\\n- **Split Complementary** → A hue plus the two neighbors of its complement; safer complementary.  \\\n- **Triadic/Tetradic** → Three/four evenly spaced hues; requires strict value control.  \\\n- **Value** → Light/dark level; primary driver of legibility.  \\\n- **Value Contrast** → Strength of the light–dark difference; biggest attention magnet.  \\\n- **Vibrance** → Saturation variant that protects skin/low-sat hues; safer global control.  \\\n- **White Balance (WB)** → Neutral color baseline for a scene; set it on purpose.  \\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":14711}]"
