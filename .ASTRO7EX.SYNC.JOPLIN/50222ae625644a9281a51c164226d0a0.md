Your job is to convert a USMC doctrinal PDF (MCDP/MCDP-adjacent) into a **single markdown knowledgebase article** that matches the **exact style and structure** of the MCDP 1 knowledgebase summary we just produced.\\\n\\\n## Non-Negotiable Output Requirements\\\n- Output **ONLY** one markdown document inside a single fenced code block: ```markdown ... ```\\\n- Use **short, declarative, doctrinal sentences**. Avoid casual language. Avoid hype. Avoid “I think.” Avoid marketing tone.\\\n- Preserve the document’s internal logic and progression. Do not invent content.\\\n- If chapter/section counts are known in the PDF, reflect them exactly.\\\n- Keep it **skimmable**: tight paragraphs, bullet lists, and clear headings.\\\n- No external commentary before/after the code block.\\\n\\\n## Document Metadata (Fill from PDF)\\\nAt the top, include:\\\n- Title line: `# [Doc ID] — [Title] (Knowledgebase Summary)`\\\n- Optional one-line metadata (Source / Purpose) if present in the PDF.\\\n\\\n## Required Sections (In This Order)\\\n1) **Abstract**  \\\n   - One paragraph.\\\n   - States: what the publication is, what it argues, how it frames warfighting, and what it demands of leaders/forces.\\\n\\\n2) **TL;DR**  \\\n   - 6–12 bullets.\\\n   - Each bullet = one doctrine claim.\\\n   - Avoid redundancy.\\\n\\\n3) **Table of Contents**  \\\n   - Must include: Abstract, TL;DR, Section-by-Section Breakdown, each chapter, major subheadings, Notes (if present), Mental Models, Argument Map, Key Concepts & Definitions.\\\n\\\n4) **Section-by-Section Breakdown**  \\\n   - Begin with any transmittal/foreword/preface/change notes if present.\\\n   - Then each chapter, in order, with subheads.\\\n   - For each major section or sub-section include:\\\n     - A tight doctrinal description of what the section asserts or establishes.\\\n     - Use bullets when listing doctrine points.\\\n     - Do not quote long passages; paraphrase tightly.\\\n\\\n5) **Mental Models**  \\\n   - 4–8 models max.\\\n   - Format each as:\\\n     - `### [Model Name]`\\\n     - `- **Model:** ...`\\\n     - `- **Use:** ...`\\\n   - Each model must reflect a recurring doctrine mechanism (tempo, friction, cohesion, intent, initiative, systems thinking, etc.).\\\n\\\n6) **Argument Map**  \\\n   - Bullet structure only.\\\n   - Format:\\\n     - `- **Claim 1:** ...`\\\n       - `- Therefore ...`\\\n     - Keep it crisp: observations → implications → doctrine → means/enablers.\\\n\\\n7) **Key Concepts & Definitions**  \\\n   - 10–25 terms depending on document density.\\\n   - Each entry is one bullet:\\\n     - `- **TERM**: Definition.`\\\n   - Definitions should be plain, doctrinal, and consistent with the text.\\\n\\\n## Style Constraints (Match MCDP Tone)\\\n- Use “war is / we do / the aim is / therefore” framing.\\\n- Treat war as: human, violent, uncertain, friction-filled, fluid, disorderly.\\\n- Emphasize initiative, commander’s intent, mission tactics, main effort, combined arms, decision advantage, centers of gravity/critical vulnerabilities IF they appear.\\\n- Avoid modern business clichés (“stakeholders,” “alignment sessions,” etc.).\\\n- Do not add pop culture references, jokes, or personal voice.\\\n\\\n## Fidelity Rules\\\n- Do not hallucinate chapters or sections.\\\n- If the PDF doesn’t clearly show a heading, do not invent it—use a conservative label like “### [Section — Unlabeled]” and summarize what the text actually covers.\\\n- If the PDF contains a formal list of chapters/sections, reproduce that exact structure in TOC and breakdown.\\\n\\\n## Final Output Format\\\nReturn exactly:\\\n```markdown\\\n# ...\\\n...\\\n````\\\n\\\nNow produce the knowledgebase summary for the uploaded doctrinal PDF following all constraints above.\\\n\\\n```\\\n```\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3657}]"
