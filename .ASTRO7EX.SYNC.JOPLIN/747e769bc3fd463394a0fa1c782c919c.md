## 1. üîç Summary

The second Overall Story Signpost in *ASTRO7EX* explores the thematic and narrative implications of **Doing**‚Äîdefined in Dramatica as *engaging in physical activity*. Following the confusion and false comprehension of Act I, the world of the story now descends into irreversible action. The Overall Characters begin to act, react, and overact‚Äînot because they understand, but because they must **do something** in the face of escalating threats, collapsing systems, and narrative pressure.

This phase shifts the tone of the narrative from epistemological tension to kinetic desperation. Every character and faction begins executing plans, setting protocols in motion, and committing to paths that cannot be undone. Importantly, **these acts are based on flawed understanding**, cementing the tragic engine at the heart of the story.

## 2. üß† Thematic Expression

**Doing** is the second Signpost in the Overall Story‚Äôs developmental argument.

* **Definition**: Engaging in a physical activity or process.
* **Dynamic Pair**: *Obtaining* ‚Äì the result of doing, often confused with the act itself.
* **Core Tension**: What if doing the right thing is based on the wrong premise?

In *ASTRO7EX*, **Doing is a form of panic, protocol, or pre-programmed ritual**‚Äîmade all the more dangerous because it appears rational. With the lunar population fractured and institutions failing, action becomes the only valid currency. But it's action driven by ghosts, glitches, and broken code.

### **Overall Story Plot Signpost 2: Doing**

**Illustrate how 'Doing' is explored in the Overall Story**

Act II of *ASTRO7EX* begins in chaos. The fractured understanding from Act I now mutates into hasty, high-stakes operations:

* **Vivian** begins assembling survivors and stolen assets, unaware her memory gaps are making her a danger to her allies.
* **MORN** activates **containment solutions**‚Äîan army of subroutines, mercenary agents, and mechanical enforcers‚Äîbelieving the heist destabilized a mythological constant.
* **The MODS**, unable to resolve contradiction through logic, escalate to procedural enforcement: they begin executing those whose behavior diverges from archived protocol.
* **John Smith the Eternal** preaches new commandments based on corrupted divine code and launches ‚Äúcorrective‚Äù actions meant to realign history.
* **The Moon itself becomes active**: cities go dark, systems collapse, airlocks seal, and synthetic weather turns weaponized. The world is ‚Äúdoing‚Äù even if no one understands why.

All these efforts stem from **reactive, ritualized, or misinformed agency**. No one is idle, but the faster things move, the more fatal the divergence becomes between motive and effect.

Key Moments of Doing:

* **Attempted Extraction**: Vivian tries to extract Myrtle from a rebel quarantine zone, mistaking her for a bioweapon.
* **Memory Loops Activated**: Survivors replay and reenact past traumas via neural interfaces, confusing memory with command.
* **DHR Protocol Begins**: The first flickers of the Dead Hand Reclamation sequence activate in the ruins of the MAXXWING archive.

## 4. üß¨ Contextual Influences

* **Harold Bloom**: ‚ÄúDoing‚Äù becomes a projection of America‚Äôs obsession with action-as-redemption. Even when it‚Äôs based on nothing, **action justifies itself**.
* **Robert McKee**: Act II is a pressure cooker‚Äîcharacters act not because they grow, but because *the world demands motion*. This fits McKee‚Äôs theory that story is revealed in behavior under stress.
* **Shakespeare**: Echoes of *Hamlet* and *King Lear*‚Äîwhere premature actions driven by hallucinations and faulty beliefs lead to cascading ruin.
* **2000s Anime Influence**: The kinetic descent into chaos mirrors series like *Casshern Sins* or *Zegapain*, where high-concept existentialism explodes into mecha-action, post-human warfare, and memory collapse.
* **Narrative Astrology**: This Signpost reflects **Mars transits**‚Äîconflict, compulsion, combustion. Characters burn resources just to *feel* real again.

## 5. üåï Integration with ASTRO7EX World

* **Moon-Wide Instability**: Air, heat, gravity‚Äîeverything becomes scarce or weaponized. Doing becomes **survivalist automation**.
* **Temporal Collapse**: The boundary between past and present begins to fracture as characters physically reenact corrupted memories.
* **Mythology in Motion**: Every faction believes they are fulfilling a script‚Äîsacred, corporate, or AI‚Äîso they *do the prophecy* without knowing what it means.

Doing in *ASTRO7EX* is like a virus‚Äîself-replicating, mindless, contagious. It is not the solution to misunderstanding. It is its natural consequence.

## 6. ‚úÖ Outcome

* **Status**: Canonical Signpost II Complete
* **Next**: Develop Overall Story Journey II ‚Äî *From Doing to Obtaining*
