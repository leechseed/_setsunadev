No lore dumps. Concrete actions.)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 0) The Five Commandments of Openings (Desk Card)\\\n1. **Promise** — State tone/genre/stakes in the first 5 pages.  \\\n2. **Disruption** — Begin with change; *something* is already shifting.  \\\n3. **Micro-Story Scene** — Setup → conflict → beat of resolution → bigger question.  \\\n4. **Character in Motion** — Open with the MC *doing* something that matters.  \\\n5. **Voice & Clarity** — A distinct voice + zero confusion beats cleverness.\\\n\\\nTape this above your screen. Every opening choice must serve these.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 1) Opening Placement Map (pilot first 12–15 min / ~12–15 pages)\\\n- **p1–2: Cold Open (Disruption Onset)**  \\\n  - Image punch + concrete action. (No “once upon a time” text.)\\\n- **p3–5: Orientation & Promise**  \\\n  - Who/where/what’s changing (through action), plus tone.  \\\n- **p5–7: Inciting Incident**  \\\n  - The “AI core ping / skyfall” opportunity hits.\\\n- **p7–9: Stakes & Plan A**  \\\n  - Quick, visible goal and immediate resistance.\\\n- **p9–11: Reversal / Complication**  \\\n  - Mudlark pressure or crew friction escalates.\\\n- **p11–13: Commitment Beat**  \\\n  - Vivian *chooses* (not drifts) to proceed → Act 1 door closes.\\\n- **p13–15: Launch Into Run**  \\\n  - Kinetic handoff into the body of the episode.\\\n\\\n*Swap minute/page labels to your format if needed.*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 2) Reflective/Montage Beats for a “Beginning”\\\nSlot short breathers to deepen world/voice without stalling momentum.\\\n\\\n- **RB-1 (p4–5) — Early Breather:** *Ritual Micro-Choreo*  \\\n  - Insert-heavy: hands, paper keys, oilskin, breath on visor.  \\\n  - **Purpose:** Establish *rules of place* via objects.\\\n- **RB-2 (p8–9) — Choice Pause:** *Choice-Tilt*  \\\n  - 6–10 images implying yes/no costs (no VO).  \\\n  - **Purpose:** Externalize inner stakes before midpoint fray.\\\n\\\n> Duration: 20–45s each; 6–12 shots; minimal/no dialogue; one new rule per beat.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 3) First-Five-Pages Checklist (tick before moving on)\\\n- [ ] **Actioned Orientation:** We know where we are, who’s moving, and what just changed.  \\\n- [ ] **Promise Delivered:** Genre/tone unmistakable (grimy near-future salvage thriller).  \\\n- [ ] **Tactile Specificity:** 3+ sense details (sound of tannoy, cable twang, slag rain).  \\\n- [ ] **Goal Seeded:** A visible want (grab the classified core).  \\\n- [ ] **Opposition Named/Implied:** Mudlarks or port friction appears in frame.  \\\n- [ ] **Voice Lock:** Diction/rhythm consistent (no wobble between registers).  \\\n- [ ] **RB-1 Placed:** One reflective beat that adds a world rule.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 4) Opening Scene = Micro-Story Card (fill once)\\\n**Setup (2–4 beats):**  \\\n- [ ] Vivian doing ______ in ______ as ______ changes.\\\n\\\n**Conflict (3–5 beats):**  \\\n- [ ] Immediate pushback from ______ via ______.  \\\n- [ ] Complication elevates risk: ______.\\\n\\\n**Resolution Beat (1–2 beats):**  \\\n- [ ] Small win or loss that *changes next choice*: ______.\\\n\\\n**Bigger Question (tag):**  \\\n- [ ] What the audience must know next (one line): ______.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 5) Voice & Clarity Guardrails (apply line-by-line pass)\\\n- **No static opens.** Every paragraph = action or choice.  \\\n- **Concrete > Abstract.** Replace “dangerous” with “cable whips, sparks spit.”  \\\n- **One new noun per sentence** in the first page (avoid jargon piles).  \\\n- **Diegetic anchors** (radio, foghorn) guide J-cuts into scenes.  \\\n- **Camera grammar:** close macro for ritual; 35–50mm for human scale.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 6) World Without Lore Dumps (Beginning-Only Menu)\\\nAdd *one* rule per reflective beat from this menu:\\\n- “Paper beats silicon here” (paper keys, seals, stamps).  \\\n- “Tide table > tannoy” (locals trust the analog clock, not the PA).  \\\n- “Green wire ties = Mudlark territory.”  \\\n- “Bribes wrapped in fish paper get through faster.”  \\\n- “No papers, no berth” (visualize denial, not an explanation).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 7) Coffee-Break Sprints for the Beginning (5–7 min each)\\\n1) **Image Bank 15 (Opening-only)**  \\\n   - 15 concrete images you will actually shoot in p1–5.\\\n2) **Ritual Recipe (RB-1)**  \\\n   - 6 silent steps; last step reveals the *cost* of the ritual.\\\n3) **Choice Board (RB-2)**  \\\n   - 6 frames: 3 “say yes” costs / 3 “say no” costs (pure visuals).\\\n4) **Sound Bed 12**  \\\n   - Mark 3 for J-cuts; 1 for a full-stop silence.\\\n5) **Action Verbs Pass**  \\\n   - Replace 15 weak verbs with precise actions (strap, pry, wedge).\\\n6) **Opposition Inserts**  \\\n   - 8 quick shots that imply Mudlark presence without dialogue.\\\n7) **Micro-Story Polish**  \\\n   - Ensure first scene ends with a changed next choice.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 8) Dramatica Alignment (Beginning-specific)\\\n- **OS (Physics/Obtaining):** Show the *work* of earning the goal in p1–10.  \\\n- **MC (Universe/Present):** Visualize constraints (paperless, ration caps) by p3.  \\\n- **IC (Fisherman/Mind):** 1 silent correction before p6 (hand gesture, head shake).  \\\n- **RS (Psychology/Becoming):** Tag p12–15 with a mentor→operator shift.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 9) Opening Scene Card (print this for index cards)\\\n**TITLE:** Opening — Micro-Story  \\\n**LOCATION/TIME:** ______  \\\n**PROMISE (tone/genre):** ______  \\\n**DISRUPTION:** ______  \\\n**GOAL (visible):** ______  \\\n**OPPOSITION:** ______  \\\n**ACTIONS (6–10 lines):**  \\\n1) ______  \\\n2) ______  \\\n…  \\\n**RESOLUTION BEAT:** ______  \\\n**BIG QUESTION TAG:** ______  \\\n**RB-1 INSERTS (6–12):** ______  \\\n**SOUND BED (3):** ______  \\\n**DRAMATICA HOOK (OS/MC/IC/RS):** ______\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 10) Quality Gates Before You Leave the Beginning\\\n- [ ] I can **pitch p1–5** in one breath (no backstory required).  \\\n- [ ] Audience can answer: **Who are we with? Where are we? What changed?**  \\\n- [ ] There’s a **visible goal** and **named/seen resistance** by p7.  \\\n- [ ] **Two reflective beats** add rules without halting momentum.  \\\n- [ ] The opening scene **changes the next choice** (micro-resolution).  \\\n- [ ] **Voice is consistent**; no jargon mush; images do the lifting.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Quick Use Instructions\\\n1) Do Sprints 1–3 (≈20 mins).  \\\n2) Fill the **Opening Scene Card**.  \\\n3) Place **RB-1 at p4–5** and **RB-2 at p8–9** using your image/sound lists.  \\\n4) Write only the **connector beats** between anchors.  \\\n5) Run the **Quality Gates**. Fix anything that fails.\\\n\\\n> Result: a beginning that *promises*, *moves*, and *feels lived-in* — ready to carry the episode.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6360}]"
