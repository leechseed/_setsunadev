Only structure.\\\n\\\n**Deliverable:**  \\\n`SCALE_SPINE.md`\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Step 4: Select a Test Artifact\\\n\\\nChoose **one small artifact**, not the entire project:\\\n- A single scene\\\n- A short story\\\n- A pilot episode\\\n- A single character arc\\\n\\\nDo not start with a universe.\\\n\\\n**Rule:**  \\\nIf the system fails at small scale, it will collapse at large scale.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Phase 3 — Run a Controlled Experiment\\\n\\\nThis phase validates the system under real conditions.\\\n\\\n### Step 5: Execute the Governance Loop\\\n\\\nFor the test artifact, run this loop deliberately:\\\n\\\n1. **Diverge** — Muse Mode, timed, no judgment\\\n2. **Converge** — Editor Mode, invariants only\\\n3. **Integrate** — Architect Mode, second-order effects\\\n4. **Commit** — Operator Mode, lock and move on\\\n\\\nModes must not overlap.  \\\nSkipping steps invalidates the test.\\\n\\\n**Deliverable:**  \\\nOne finished artifact that survived governance.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Step 6: Post-Mortem the Process\\\n\\\nDo not critique the art.  \\\nCritique the **process**.\\\n\\\nQuestions to answer:\\\n- Where did chaos help?\\\n- Where did chaos mislead?\\\n- Which invariant did the most work?\\\n- Which step was hardest to respect?\\\n\\\nAdjust governance rules, not creative instincts.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Phase 4 — Scale Decision Point\\\n\\\nAfter one full cycle, make a single decision:\\\n\\\n> Do I trust this system enough to scale it?\\\n\\\n- If **yes**: apply it to the next larger unit (scene → arc, arc → season)\\\n- If **no**: repair governance before expanding scope\\\n\\\nScaling without trust guarantees collapse.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Hard Truths\\\n\\\nYour primary risk is not lack of skill, intelligence, or taste.\\\n\\\nIt is **over-identification with the generative state**.\\\n\\\nSystems thinking is not here to cage creativity.  \\\nIt exists to decide **when creativity is allowed to run wild**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Immediate Next Action\\\n\\\nDo this today:\\\n\\\n1. Open a blank file\\\n2. Name it `INVARIANTS.md`\\\n3. Write blunt, unpoetic invariant statements\\\n4. Stop at five\\\n5. Do not revise for beauty—only for truth\\\n\\\nThis is the first irreversible step.\\\n\\\nEnd of document.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4804}]"
