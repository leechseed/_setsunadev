## 1. Character Description

### 🟦 **Myrtle** – *Sidekick*

* **Motivation**: Feeling, Faith, Support
* **Purpose**: Order, Inertia, Accurate, Result
* **Evaluation**: Accurate, Result
* **Methodology**: Deduction, Acceptance, Certainty

> Myrtle is the still water in the storm. Small, quiet, unwavering. Where MODS withhold humanity, Myrtle offers it in full—without judgment, without expectation. Her presence doesn’t push, it anchors. She rarely speaks unless asked, yet her silence always listens. She embodies the kind of loyalty that makes no demands and gives without condition. Myrtle’s dramatic function is to sustain the protagonist’s faith when evidence and reason fail—to be *the part of the world that believes in you anyway*.

---

## 2. Narrative Function

### 🎭 Dramatic Function: **Sidekick**

In Dramatica theory, the Sidekick is the narrative role defined by **Faith** and **Support**. This archetype functions as the emotional pillar of the protagonist’s journey, often serving as a gentle reminder of purpose, trust, and human connection when the path becomes unclear. They rarely act independently; instead, their dramatic power lies in how they *respond* and *believe*.

---

### 2.1. Narrative Support Through Faith

Myrtle believes in Vivian even when Vivian doesn’t. She has no strategic agenda, no logic ladder—just quiet conviction. She reinforces Vivian’s journey through **presence**, not persuasion.

> “You’re not wrong to feel this way.”
> “You don’t have to do it alone.”
> “I’ll be here when it hurts.”

Faith, for Myrtle, isn’t blind. It’s enduring.

---

### 2.2. Emotional Counterbalance to MODS

Where MODS represent mechanistic **disbelief**, Myrtle embodies organic **faith**. MODS negate input unless it fits the system. Myrtle *absorbs* every input and offers warmth in return.

* **MODS** = silence
* **Myrtle** = empathy

She’s not a rebuttal to MODS. She’s *resistance by believing anyway*.

---

### 2.3. Strategic Reinforcement of the Story Goal

While Myrtle does not directly pursue or defend the story goal, she makes its pursuit **emotionally sustainable**. She:

* Reminds Vivian of what’s worth protecting
* Validates Vivian’s emotional responses
* Grounds narrative stakes in personal, lived connection

Myrtle reinforces *why* the story goal matters.

---

### 2.4. Instrument of Intimacy (Not Leadership)

Myrtle is not a leader. She does not organize or challenge. But she is essential—her calm becomes Vivian’s tether when truth becomes chaos. She functions like *a spiritual homebase* that Vivian can return to without shame.

Her strength lies in **not needing to be strong**.

---

### 2.5. Emotional Compass for Vivian

In the same way MODS act as an Impact Character, Myrtle acts as an **internal axis** for Vivian—a living memory of who she was before all this started. Myrtle:

* Reflects Vivian’s compassion
* Respects her rage without fearing it
* Waits without withdrawing

Where others push, Myrtle *remains*.

---

## 3. Activity Profile

### 🟦 **Myrtle’s Activities (Sidekick Function)**

Myrtle shows her role through small, consistent acts:

* Sitting beside Vivian during her breakdowns
* Refusing to walk away, even when shut out
* Making time for the unspoken needs
* Offering emotional insight without preaching

Her methodology is quiet **deduction**: she sees what’s really happening beneath Vivian’s words and responds with unconditional warmth. She’s not trying to change Vivian. She’s trying to *understand* her—and that, ironically, becomes the strongest force for change.

---

## 4. Summary

> Myrtle doesn’t fight for the story goal. She *reminds you why it’s worth it.*

She is the stillness that makes motion possible. The listener that makes truth bearable. In ASTRO7EX, Myrtle is **the spirit of unyielding belief**—not in systems, not in success, but in *Vivian*.

Her role as Sidekick is not to act as shield or sword, but as **soul**—to be the one part of the world that never asks you to prove your worth.
