## 🧬 Overview

The relationship between **Myrtle** and **Fiona** in *ASTRO7EX* functions as a metaphysical paradox: a ghost-child of empathy confronting a sovereign woman forged in decadence, control, and denial. Myrtle exposes Fiona’s buried longing for innocence. Fiona, in turn, represents the adult world Myrtle never entered—fractured, sensual, and dangerously fluent in disconnection.

Their bond becomes a **corrupted loop of nurture**: not quite mother-daughter, not quite predator-prey. Fiona attempts to possess Myrtle, reshape her, or erase her entirely—anything but understand her. Myrtle, despite everything, tries to reach Fiona with compassion.

The tragedy lies in their asymmetry:

* **Myrtle wants to understand Fiona.**
* **Fiona wants to possess or erase Myrtle.**
* **In the end, neither succeeds.**

---

## 🪞 Establishing the Relationship

**Initial Premise:**
Myrtle enters Fiona’s awareness not as a threat, but as a puzzle—an unplaceable ghost who moves through systems that should not register her. Fiona, who thrives on control and information leverage, is both amused and unsettled.

**Key Introduction Beats:**

* Fiona first sees Myrtle **on a monitor she didn't install**—a glitch, or a ghost.
* Myrtle speaks a phrase Fiona’s mother once said, perfectly word-for-word.
* Fiona misinterprets Myrtle as a spy, AI, or hallucination—a symptom to be diagnosed.

**Craft Techniques Referenced:**

* **Hooked** (Edgerton): Establish the relationship with mystery, subversion of genre expectation.
* **The First Five Pages** (Lukeman): Use an immediate psychic contradiction—Fiona feels affection and threat simultaneously.
* **Joseph Campbell**: The child as a supernatural threshold figure—the "innocent guide" who offers passage into shadow.

## 🔧 Developing the Relationship

**Emotional & Thematic Progression:**

* Myrtle begins to haunt Fiona—sometimes physically appearing, sometimes disrupting systems Fiona believes she controls.
* Their dynamic teeters between **soft dominance** (Fiona offering warmth) and **implied threat** (Myrtle revealing things Fiona’s buried).
* Fiona attempts to manipulate Myrtle, testing whether she's programmable or corruptible. Myrtle resists—not through defiance, but through **uninterpretable empathy**.

**Core Interactions:**

* Myrtle gives Fiona a dead flower in a moment of tenderness. Fiona later burns it.
* Fiona tries to 'teach' Myrtle about pain and pleasure, only to find the child already understands too much.
* Myrtle hacks Fiona’s sex simulation chamber—not to destroy it, but to leave behind a memory of Fiona’s mother.

**Craft Techniques Referenced:**

* **Maass: Emotional Craft** – escalate internal contrast rather than plot confrontation.
* **Writing Deep Scenes** – this arc lives in interiority; dialogue is spare, symbols rich.
* **Bloom** – Myrtle becomes a “misreading” of Fiona’s own girlhood; a spiritual rival to her own self-authorship.

## 🕯️ Resolving the Relationship

**Culmination Event:**
Myrtle finally confronts Fiona during a breakdown in the lunar core’s neural chamber—where memory, pleasure, and trauma loop as unstable data. Myrtle appears not as a child but a mirror of Fiona—aged, wounded, and luminous.

**Outcome:**

* Fiona attempts to overwrite Myrtle.
* Myrtle responds by calling her “Mom” and vanishes.
* Fiona collapses. For the first time, she is alone with her own memory—unmediated, unsexualized, unadorned.

**Craft Techniques Referenced:**

* **Writing for Emotional Impact (Iglesias)** – Use reversal and emotional rupture.
* **Robert McKee – Character** – End the arc not with resolution, but irrevocable transformation.
* **Astrological Transits** – Myrtle's Venus squares Fiona’s Saturn. They are karmically bound, but never reconciled.

| **Harold Bloom** – American Orphanhood | Fiona sees herself as self-created. Myrtle reintroduces the possibility of being *born*.                                                    |
| **Joseph Campbell** – The Goddess      | Myrtle is the unclaimed daughter of the underworld goddess Fiona once might’ve been.                                                        |
| **Late 2000s Anime**                   | The emotionally dissociated older woman (Fiona) meets the soft-coded AI girl (Myrtle), ala *Ergo Proxy*, *Texhnolyze*, or *Haibane Renmei*. |
| **Narrative Astrology**                | Composite chart shows Fiona’s Pluto conjunct Myrtle’s Moon — obsession, control, soul-deep psychic disturbance.                             |

## 🎯 Summary

Myrtle and Fiona never truly *connect*—but their near-connection defines Fiona’s emotional failure and Myrtle’s incorruptible grace. Fiona cannot erase Myrtle. Myrtle cannot save Fiona. Their relationship lives in the tragic non-space between affection and annihilation.

> One wanted to be loved.
> The other wanted to be *left alone*.
> They got neither.
