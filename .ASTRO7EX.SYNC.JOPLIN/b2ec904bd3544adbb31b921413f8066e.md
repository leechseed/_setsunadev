## Terminology Primer (Read First)

- **Aspect Ratio** ‚Üí Width:height of your frame (e.g., 3:2, 4:3, 16:9, 1:1, 2.39:1). Affects how grids land and where ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù feel right.  
- **Phi (œÜ)** ‚Üí The golden ratio ‚âà **1.618**. Its inverse ‚âà **0.618**. Use 0.618√ó and 0.382√ó to place ‚Äúgolden section‚Äù lines.  
- **Phi Grid** ‚Üí A grid like thirds, but lines sit at **38.2% / 61.8%** (not 33% / 66%).  
- **Golden Rectangle** ‚Üí A rectangle whose sides are in the ratio 1:1.618. Subdividing it generates **whirling squares** and the **golden spiral**.  
- **Fibonacci Sequence** ‚Üí 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13‚Ä¶ Ratios between adjacent numbers tend toward œÜ; used to approximate golden spirals.  
- **Root Rectangle (‚àön)** ‚Üí A rectangle whose side ratio is ‚àön:1 (e.g., ‚àö2 ‚âà 1.414). Foundation of **dynamic symmetry**.  
- **Dynamic Symmetry** ‚Üí A proportional armature system using diagonals and **reciprocals** inside root rectangles to create placement guides.  
- **Reciprocal (line)** ‚Üí In dynamic symmetry, a line drawn **perpendicular** to a diagonal, anchored at key points; intersections are high-value placement nodes.  
- **Armature of the Rectangle** ‚Üí The basic diagonal network of a frame (corner-to-corner diagonals + reciprocals), often called **Baroque (‚Üó)** and **Sinister (‚Üò)** thrusts.  
- **Rabatment** ‚Üí ‚ÄúSquaring‚Äù the rectangle: a construction that drops a perfect square inside a rectangle to create strong compositional sub-frames.  
- **Hot Spot / Power Point** ‚Üí Intersections or nodes where attention naturally gathers (e.g., thirds intersections, phi intersections, diagonal‚Äìreciprocal crossings).  
- **Grid Drift** ‚Üí Misalignment between grid and subject that creates tension‚Äîuse intentionally or fix it.  
- **Value Contrast / Edge Sharpness** ‚Üí (From Core Principles) The **difference in light/dark** and the **crispness of edges**; these still dominate read even when using grids.

> Grids help you **place** things. **Values and edges** still determine whether the placement reads.

---

## How to Use This Guide
- **Pick one armature** per image. Stacking multiple grids usually muddies intent.  
- **Use grids to decide placement**, then enforce **value hierarchy** and **edge control** to make the placement work.  
- **Adjust for aspect ratio**: the same rule feels different in 1:1 vs 2.39:1 frames.  
- **When in doubt**: thirds for speed, diagonals for energy, spiral for flow, root rectangles for complex multi-figure order.

---

## Choosing a System (Decision Guide)

- **Fast, safe, versatile** ‚Üí **Rule of Thirds**.  
- **Subtle, classical spacing** ‚Üí **Phi Grid** or **Golden Rectangle/Spiral**.  
- **Dynamic, directional energy** ‚Üí **Golden Triangle** or **Armature diagonals**.  
- **Complex scenes / multi-figure layouts** ‚Üí **Dynamic Symmetry (root rectangles)**.  
- **Center-driven or rectangle-within-rectangle** ‚Üí **Rabatment**.  
- **Precision product/typography** ‚Üí **Fourths/Fifths** or **Modular/Baseline grids**.  
- **Square or ultra-wide formats** ‚Üí See **Format Notes** before choosing.

---

## Systems ‚Äî Construction, Use, & Fixes

### 4.1 Rule of Thirds
**What**  
Divide frame into **3√ó3**; place subjects on **intersections** or along lines.

**Construction**  
Lines at **33.33%** and **66.67%** of width/height.

**Where to place**  
- Focal on a **power point** (intersection).  
- Horizons on top/bottom third.  
- Eyes of a portrait near the upper third.

**Use when**  
Quick balance, general-purpose photography/film/storyboards, beginner-friendly.

**Typical mistakes**  
Formulaic ‚Äúgrid-following‚Äù with no value hierarchy; horizon barely off third (reads sloppy).

**Quick fixes**  
- Commit: snap horizon **exactly** to a line.  
- Boost value contrast at the focal; soften elsewhere.  
- If it looks generic, break the rule on purpose (center or diagonal).

**Context**  
- *Landscape*: Foreground anchor ‚Üí horizon on top third.  
- *UI*: Hero image aligned to thirds; CTA sits near a power point.

**Checklist**  
- Is the subject on/near a node or line with **clear value emphasis**?

---

### 4.2 Phi Grid (Golden Sections)
**What**  
A variant of thirds using the **golden sections** instead of equal thirds.

**Construction**  
Verticals at **0.382W** and **0.618W**; horizontals at **0.382H** and **0.618H**.

**Where to place**  
- Focal on a phi intersection.  
- Secondary masses aligned to opposing phi line for asymmetrical balance.

**Use when**  
You want subtler spacing and a more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù feel than thirds; product, portrait, fine art.

**Typical mistakes**  
Treating phi like a magic spell; forcing awkward placements to ‚Äúhit the math.‚Äù

**Quick fixes**  
- If the phi line placement weakens the read, slide toward thirds or center; **values first**.  
- Keep backgrounds simpler to let subtle offsets shine.

**Context**  
- *Portrait/Fashion*: Eye near upper phi; shoulder line along lower phi.  
- *Product*: Key feature sits on a phi node; label aligns to a phi line.

**Checklist**  
- Does the image still read in grayscale with the focal at/near a phi node?

---

### 4.3 Golden Rectangle & Spiral (Fibonacci / Whirling Squares)
**What**  
Use a **golden rectangle** and its **whirling squares** to lay a **logarithmic spiral** that curls into a focal.

**Construction**  
- Start with a 1:1.618 rectangle.  
- Subdivide the larger side into a square; repeat to create descending squares.  
- Draw quarter-circle arcs through square corners to form the spiral.

**Where to place**  
- Put the **focal point in the tight coil** of the spiral.  
- Align major edges and curves to the spiral‚Äôs arm.

**Use when**  
You want **guided flow** into a single dominant subject; classic paintings, hero shots, title cards.

**Typical mistakes**  
Cargo-cult overlays not matching the actual **aspect ratio**; spiral forced against subject gesture.

**Quick fixes**  
- Mirror/rotate the spiral to match the gesture.  
- If the flow fights the subject, switch to **Golden Triangle** or **Armature**.

**Context**  
- *Key Art*: Spiral sweeps from background elements into the face/hands.  
- *Landscape*: River bends along the spiral arm into a lighthouse.

**Checklist**  
- Do leading lines **follow** the spiral, and is the focal **inside the coil**, not outside it?

---

### 4.4 Golden Triangle
**What**  
A diagonal-based composition: one main **corner-to-corner diagonal**, plus a **perpendicular** line from the opposite corner.

**Construction**  
- Draw a diagonal from one corner to the opposite.  
- From one of the remaining corners, draw a line **perpendicular** to that diagonal until it hits it.  
- You now have two large acute triangles and one smaller right triangle.

**Where to place**  
- Align strong edges/gestures along the **long diagonal**.  
- Put the focal at the **intersection** or near the acute corners.

**Use when**  
Action, dynamic slopes, strong gestural poses, landscapes with hills.

**Typical mistakes**  
Minor elements parallel to the main diagonal (creates monotony), or everything crammed at one corner.

**Quick fixes**  
- Use **counter-diagonal** accents (shorter lines crossing the main).  
- Add negative space opposite the focal to breathe.

**Context**  
- *Sports*: Runner‚Äôs lean aligns with the long diagonal; finish line perpendicular.  
- *Architecture*: Staircase diagonal + handrail/perpendiculars.

**Checklist**  
- Does the long diagonal carry energy **into** the focal, not out of frame?

---

### 4.5 Dynamic Symmetry (Root Rectangles ‚àö2, ‚àö3, ‚àö5)
**What**  
A proportional system (popularized by Jay Hambidge; modern usage refined by George Bell et al.) using **root rectangles**, diagonals, and **reciprocals** to create **placement nodes** and implied rhythms.

**Construction (‚àö2 example)**  
- Start with a rectangle of ratio **‚àö2:1 (~1.414:1)**.  
- Draw both corner-to-corner **diagonals**.  
- From midpoints/corners, draw **reciprocals**: lines **perpendicular to a diagonal** that land on the opposite side.  
- Intersections of diagonals/reciprocals become **nodes**.

**Where to place**  
- Put focal/anchors at **node intersections**.  
- Run edges/gestures along **diagonals** and **reciprocal** lines.

**Use when**  
Multi-figure scenes, architecture, product boards, complex balance problems.

**Typical mistakes**  
Over-constructing (grid worship), ignoring **value/edge hierarchy**, using the wrong **root** for your aspect.

**Quick fixes**  
- Prune: keep only the **few lines** that actually support your subject.  
- Switch root to better fit your frame (**‚àö2** suits ISO paper 1:‚àö2; **‚àö3/‚àö5** for other wide/tall feels).

**Context**  
- *Editorial spread*: Photos and text blocks snap to node grid with rhythm.  
- *Figurative*: Figure mass on one node; counter-mass (prop/light) on a reciprocal node.

**Checklist**  
- Are you using **line-of-force nodes** to place subjects, **then** enforcing values/edges?

---

### 4.6 Armature of the Rectangle (Baroque/Sinister Diagonals + Reciprocals)
**What**  
The fundamental diagonal scaffolding of any rectangle: **Baroque** (‚Üó) and **Sinister** (‚Üò) diagonals plus **reciprocals** (perpendiculars to those diagonals).

**Construction**  
- Draw both corner-to-corner diagonals.  
- From each corner, drop **reciprocal** lines at right angles to the diagonal.  
- The mesh yields natural **power nodes**.

**Where to place**  
- Align primary thrust to either Baroque ‚Üó or Sinister ‚Üò.  
- Place focal near **diagonal‚Äìreciprocal intersections**.

**Use when**  
You want **directional energy** with a light grid; quick alternative to full dynamic symmetry.

**Typical mistakes**  
Fighting diagonals with horizontal/vertical subject lines; crowding the intersection with clutter.

**Quick fixes**  
- Rotate the subject/props to echo the chosen diagonal.  
- Simplify around the focal node; let the diagonal breathe.

**Context**  
- *Cinematic frame*: Character stride on Baroque line; light beam reciprocal.  
- *Poster*: Title block on a reciprocal; actor‚Äôs gaze along the diagonal.

**Checklist**  
- Is one diagonal clearly dominant, and do supporting elements **echo** it?

---

### 4.7 Rabatment of the Rectangle
**What**  
‚ÄúSquaring‚Äù inside the frame to create **sub-frames** that feel naturally stable.

**Construction**  
- In a horizontal rectangle, swing a square from left or right side across the height (same height as the frame).  
- The leftover strip is a secondary zone. Repeat on both sides to get symmetrical squares.

**Where to place**  
- Focal **inside the square**; secondary elements in the remainder.  
- Vertical compositions: square from top/bottom.

**Use when**  
Poster layouts, portraits, still life, when a centered-but-not-really centered feel is desired.

**Typical mistakes**  
Placing the focal straddling the square boundary (feels indecisive).

**Quick fixes**  
- Nudge focal fully **into** the square or clearly into the remainder strip.  
- Use value contrast to strengthen the square‚Äôs dominance.

**Context**  
- *Poster/UI hero*: Main image in the square; tagline in the leftover strip.  
- *Portrait*: Head/torso in square; background texture in strip.

**Checklist**  
- Does the square hold the subject cleanly with **clear separation** from the strip?

---

### 4.8 Grids of Fourths & Fifths; Rule of Odds
**What**  
Equal subdivisions finer than thirds. **Fourths** (25/50/75%) and **Fifths** (20/40/60/80%) give tighter control.

**Construction**  
Divide width/height by 4 or 5; draw guides.

**Where to place**  
- Product seams, typography baselines, architectural rhythms.  
- Use **Rule of Odds** (3, 5, 7 items) for natural groupings along these lines.

**Use when**  
You need precision spacing; UI/print grids; still life/product.

**Typical mistakes**  
Even, lifeless spacing without a dominant beat.

**Quick fixes**  
- Promote one line as dominant; vary spacing/size to create **rhythm**.  
- Keep focal on a **dominant line**; support with weaker lines.

**Context**  
- *Catalog/Product*: Hero product on 40% line; accessories on 60/80%.  
- *UI*: Baseline grid in fourths; modules snap cleanly.

**Checklist**  
- Is there a **dominant** line/beat, or is everything evenly meh?

---

### 4.9 Format Notes: Square, Classic, Widescreen, Panoramic
**Square (1:1)**  
- Symmetry and **central** designs thrive; diagonals must work harder.  
- Prefer **Rabatment** or **Armature**; thirds feel cramped.

**3:2 (35mm), 4:3 (micro four-thirds)**  
- Thirds and phi grid feel natural; diagonals read well.  
- Dynamic symmetry: **‚àö5** often suits 3:2; **‚àö3** suits 4:3.

**16:9 (widescreen)**  
- Great for **Golden Triangle** and **Armature**; horizon management crucial.  
- Spiral can feel stretched‚Äîuse only if flow truly matches.

**2.39:1 (cinemascope/pano)**  
- Embrace **diagonals** and **layered depth**; thirds become very far apart.  
- Use **multiple anchors** along a diagonal; Rabatment can split center vs wings.

**Checklist**  
- Did you choose a grid that **fits the aspect** rather than force-fitting the subject?

---

### 4.10 Modular & Baseline Grids (Graphic/UI)
**What**  
Column and baseline systems for typography and UI components.

**Construction**  
- Columns (e.g., 12-col grid), gutters, margins; **baseline grid** (e.g., 8px rhythm).  
- Modules = column √ó row units.

**Where to place**  
- Headlines snap to columns; body text to baselines; CTAs align to module edges.

**Use when**  
Designing layouts, dashboards, multi-screen systems; ensuring **consistency** and scannability.

**Typical mistakes**  
Centering everything in columns but ignoring **visual hierarchy** (no primary).

**Quick fixes**  
- Assign a **dominant column span** to the hero module; keep others subordinate.  
- Preserve baseline rhythm; avoid orphaned lines.

**Checklist**  
- Do modules align while still giving the hero **clear dominance**?

---

## Diagnostics & Stress Tests
- **Grid Fit Check** ‚Üí Do key edges/focals **actually** coincide with lines/nodes?  
- **Value Override Test** ‚Üí Toggle grayscale: does the focal still win? If not, fix values.  
- **Edge Audit** ‚Üí Are the **sharpest edges** clustered near a node/line (not random)?  
- **Exit Vectors** ‚Üí Do diagonals/lines lead **into** the frame and focal, not out?  
- **Aspect Compliance** ‚Üí Is the chosen system appropriate for the frame ratio?

---

## Workflow & Setup (Overlays, Apps, Cameras)
- **Photoshop/Krita**: Save templates with **thirds, phi, armature**, and **dynamic symmetry** overlays on separate layers; assign toggles.  
- **Procreate**: Actions ‚Üí Canvas ‚Üí Drawing Guide; import PNG overlays (spiral/armature).  
- **Affinity/Illustrator/InDesign**: Use column/baseline grids; make **phi guides** via percentage guides (38.2%, 61.8%).  
- **Cameras**: Enable **grid** and **level**; some bodies offer rule-of-thirds/diagonal grids.  
- **Naming overlays**: `thirds.png`, `phi_grid.png`, `spiral_whirling.png`, `armature.png`, `root2_dynamic.png`, `rabatment.png`.

---

## Exercises That Build Skill Fast
1. **12-Overlay Drill** ‚Üí Take one scene; compose 3 versions each with **thirds**, **phi**, **triangle**, **armature**. Compare reads in grayscale.  
2. **Spiral Match** ‚Üí Sketch a subject gesture; rotate/mirror the spiral until it truly matches; place focal in the coil.  
3. **Diagonal Day** ‚Üí Shoot/paint five frames driven by **Baroque ‚Üó** and five by **Sinister ‚Üò**. Study mood change.  
4. **Root Node Placement** ‚Üí Build a **‚àö2** and a **‚àö3** grid; place figures/props only on **node intersections**.  
5. **Rabatment Portraits** ‚Üí Place the head/torso inside the square; use the leftover strip for story props.  
6. **Fourth/Fifth Precision** ‚Üí Lay a product board on **fifths**; create one **dominant** line and two minors.  
7. **Format Switch** ‚Üí Reframe a piece from 3:2 to 1:1 and 2.39:1; pick the best-fitting grid each time.

---

## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)
- **Grid Worship** ‚Üí Pretty lines, bad read. **Cure**: values/edges decide legibility; grid only helps placement.  
- **Wrong Grid for Aspect** ‚Üí Spiral in 1:1 looks cramped. **Cure**: choose per **format**.  
- **Over-Construction** ‚Üí 30 lines, zero focus. **Cure**: keep 3‚Äì5 operative lines; hide the rest.  
- **Parallel Monotony** ‚Üí Everything follows the same diagonal. **Cure**: add **reciprocals** and counters.  
- **Sloppy ‚ÄúAlmost‚Äù** ‚Üí Horizon almost on a line. **Cure**: snap or break decisively.  
- **Ignoring Flow** ‚Üí Focal on a node but lines point out. **Cure**: bend vectors **inward**.

---

## Cheat Sheet Summary
- **Thirds for speed**, **phi** for subtlety, **spiral** for flow, **triangles/armature** for energy, **dynamic symmetry** for complexity, **rabatment** for stable sub-frames.  
- Choose per **aspect ratio**; don‚Äôt force.  
- Use grids to **place**, then win with **value contrast** and **edge sharpness**.  
- Limit active lines; guard nodes from clutter; keep exits blocked.

---

## Extended Glossary

- **Armature** ‚Üí The core diagonal scaffold (diagonals + reciprocals) of a rectangle.  
- **Baroque Diagonal** ‚Üí The rising ‚Üó diagonal (bottom-left ‚Üí top-right); often feels uplifting/forward.  
- **Sinister Diagonal** ‚Üí The falling ‚Üò diagonal (top-left ‚Üí bottom-right); often feels descending/foreboding.  
- **Baseline Grid (Design)** ‚Üí Evenly spaced horizontal guides (e.g., 8px) that text lines snap to.  
- **Geometric Center vs Visual Center** ‚Üí The exact center vs where a centered subject *feels* centered (usually a touch above).  
- **Hot Spot / Power Point** ‚Üí Intersection of guides (thirds, phi, diagonal‚Äìreciprocal) with high placement value.  
- **Rabatment** ‚Üí Constructing an internal square inside a rectangle to create dominant sub-frames.  
- **Reciprocal (Dynamic Symmetry)** ‚Üí A line dropped at a right angle to a diagonal from a key point; crossings build nodes.  
- **Root 2 / Root 3 / Root 5** ‚Üí Rectangles with side ratios ‚àö2 (~1.414), ‚àö3 (~1.732), ‚àö5 (~2.236); each generates different internal rhythms.  
- **Whirling Squares** ‚Üí The nested squares inside a golden rectangle used to trace a golden spiral.  
- **Grid Drift** ‚Üí Intentional or accidental slight misalignment that creates tension.  
- **Node** ‚Üí Intersection point of significant armature lines used for placement.  
- **Value Contrast** ‚Üí Difference in light/dark between adjacent shapes; strongest driver of first read.  
- **Edge Sharpness** ‚Üí Speed of transition at edges; sharp draws attention, soft recedes.
