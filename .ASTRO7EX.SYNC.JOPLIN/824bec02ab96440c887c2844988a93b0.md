📘 4 Layer 0 Ontological Reality

# 📘 Layer 0 Ontological Reality

## 1. Ontology — *What exists / counts as real*
**A promise never kept does not exist.**

> Reality only recognizes what is enacted. Intent without execution has no ontological weight.

---

## 2. Causality — *How actions create outcomes*
**Resistance reveals power; it does not erase it.**

> Opposition exposes the true scale, structure, and response of power without guaranteeing its removal.

---

## 3. Time / Accumulation — *How change builds*
**Left alone, power grows.**

> Inaction and indecision advantage existing power structures through accumulation over time.

---

## 4. Irreversibility / Cost — *What can’t be undone*
**You don’t walk away clean.**

> Every action leaves residue; payment alters the actor and permanently changes the state.

---

## 5. Entropy / Decay — *What fails without upkeep*
**Integrity requires maintenance.**

> Coherence, stability, and legitimacy persist only through continuous effort.
