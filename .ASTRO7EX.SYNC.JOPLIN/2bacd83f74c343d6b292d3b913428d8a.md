[Summary](#summary)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Overview**\\\nThe **Ghost** is the premier solo raider archetype in ARC Raiders.  \\\nIts core fantasy:  \\\n**Be unseen. Be unheard. Take only the fights you choose.**  \\\nSound management, stealth perks, and trap disarming make the Ghost ideal for blueprint hunting, safe material farming, and consistent extraction.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Ghost Mental Model**\\\n## **“Silence is safety. Safety is profit.”**\\\n\\\nThis build relies on:\\\n- Minimal noise  \\\n- Maximum control  \\\n- Avoiding direct conflict  \\\n- Efficient looting routes  \\\n- Strategic extractions  \\\n- Survivability through disengagement  \\\n\\\nThe Ghost turns ARC Raiders into a game of **position, timing, and silence discipline.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **PSTO Breakdown**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Policy**\\\n**“I avoid danger by avoiding detection.”**\\\n\\\nAs a solo player:\\\n- You cannot reliably win PvP  \\\n- You cannot tank large ARC groups  \\\n- You rely on stealth, positioning, and route control  \\\n\\\nYour identity:\\\n- A stealth scavenger  \\\n- A precision looter  \\\n- A trap-disarmer and silent navigator  \\\n- A non-linear threat avoider  \\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Strategy**\\\n**“Invest deeply in the Survival tree.”**\\\n\\\nCore strategy:\\\n- Commit to the Survival tree’s stealth, quiet movement, and resource efficiency  \\\n- Pick up Mobility early nodes (stamina, climbing, dodging)  \\\n- Use minimal points in Combat  \\\n- Reach **the 15-point Survival unlocks** as soon as possible  \\\n- Build your power curve around **staying undetected**  \\\n\\\nBuild framework:\\\n- **Deep Survival + Light Mobility**  \\\n- Very minimal Combat unless a node solves a specific need\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Tactics**\\\n**“Unlock universal nodes early, then push Survival hard.”**\\\n\\\nTactical decisions:\\\n- Buy Field Crafting early  \\\n- Buy stamina upgrades early (Mobility Tier 1)  \\\n- Buy breaching speed (Survival Tier 1)  \\\n- Then, funnel points into Survival to reach high-tier stealth bonuses  \\\n- Only buy cross-tree nodes when they enhance Ghost mechanics (e.g., resource efficiency)\\\n\\\nTactical principles:\\\n- You win by reducing encounters  \\\n- You loot by controlling your sound profile  \\\n- You survive by disengaging early and often  \\\n- You extract by staying unpredictable in your routing\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Operations**\\\n**“In practice, this is how you level and play the Ghost.”**\\\n\\\nConcrete actions:\\\n- Unlock Field Crafting → stamina → quiet looting → disarming  \\\n- Move crouched or walk between loot clusters  \\\n- Break contact as soon as sound spikes  \\\n- Loot interiors, cabinets, drawers — silent containers  \\\n- Always safe-pocket blueprints  \\\n- Never open loud containers when players may be nearby  \\\n- Extract proactively, not reactively  \\\n- Use flares to misdirect when needed  \\\n- Avoid 2+ enemy engagements entirely  \\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Skill Tree Allocation Plan**\\\n\\\n## **Early Game (Levels 1–20)**\\\n- Field Crafting  \\\n- Stamina upgrades (Mobility T1)  \\\n- Breaching speed  \\\n- Quiet looting  \\\n- Basic survival perks (health / resistance if needed)\\\n\\\n## **Mid Game (Levels 20–45)**\\\n- Invest to reach **15 Survival Points**  \\\n- Unlock stealth milestone perks  \\\n- Unlock trap disarming  \\\n- Unlock quiet traversal perks  \\\n- Add mobility nodes that enhance repositioning\\\n\\\n## **Late Game (Levels 45–75)**\\\n- Deepen Survival for silent mastery  \\\n- Add Mobility where it helps pathing  \\\n- Avoid Combat unless you need a specific utility perk  \\\n- Optional: Allocate final points for resource efficiency or late-game safety perks\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Core Strengths**\\\n- Safest solo build in the entire game  \\\n- Avoids most PvP encounters  \\\n- Best blueprint farmer  \\\n- Excellent trap and mine immunity  \\\n- Low resource footprint  \\\n- Extremely consistent extraction success  \\\n- Can raid nearly indefinitely without fighting\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Weaknesses & Mitigations**\\\n| Weakness | Mitigation |\\\n|---------|------------|\\\n| Low combat power | Avoid fights entirely; ambush only when advantageous |\\\n| Limited burst mobility | Use stamina nodes + dodging discipline |\\\n| Few defensive capstones | Avoid detection; break line of sight early |\\\n| Slower clear speed | Focus on blueprint routes, not full map clears |\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Ghost Gameplay Loop**\\\n\\\n**1. Enter silently**  \\\nWalk or crouch toward your first loot cluster.\\\n\\\n**2. Loot with minimal noise**  \\\nPrefer drawers, cabinets, backpacks, indoor clusters.\\\n\\\n**3. Avoid fights**  \\\nIf ARC or players are heard → reposition immediately.\\\n\\\n**4. Open only unopened containers**  \\\nEvery open is a blueprint roll.\\\n\\\n**5. Safe-pocket all high-value items**  \\\nNever risk carrying it in inventory.\\\n\\\n**6. Extract early**  \\\nNever stay for “one more building.”\\\n\\\n**7. Profit**  \\\nConsistency beats jackpot hunting.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Recommended Loadout**\\\n\\\n### **Weapons**\\\n- Silenced SMG or DMR  \\\n- Mid-distance fallback rifle  \\\n- Avoid loud weapons unless mandatory\\\n\\\n### **Armor**\\\n- Medium armor (don’t compromise movement)  \\\n- Light armor if you want maximum stealth mobility\\\n\\\n### **Consumables**\\\n- Bandages  \\\n- Shield chargers  \\\n- Emergency powercells  \\\n- Smoke / flares for misdirection  \\\n\\\n### **Utility**\\\n- Flashlights, quiet tools, anything that minimizes noise footprint\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Summary**\\\nThe Ghost is the definitive solo build in ARC Raiders.\\\n\\\nUsing the PSTO model:\\\n- **Policy:** Avoid detection  \\\n- **Strategy:** Deep Survival + Light Mobility  \\\n- **Tactics:** Prioritize early universal nodes, then specialize  \\\n- **Operations:** Play quietly, control engagements, extract consistently  \\\n\\\nThis build provides:\\\n- Maximum safety  \\\n- Maximum blueprint gain  \\\n- Maximum solo consistency  \\\n- Minimum unnecessary combat  \\\n\\\nSilent.
