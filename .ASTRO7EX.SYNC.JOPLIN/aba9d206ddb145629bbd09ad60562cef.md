world condition - humanity on the brink of annihalation 
the 'grounded' western nations of earth decay with over population, opressive beauocracies, and a class system that prioritizes the needs and benefits of a micro-gilded set of indivdiuals in the western world. A decadent gilded class that is purely driven for personal survivability where the only choice is what is within their own personal gain regardless of the pain and suffering of the other.  

central and south america have built a de-centralized shard node based digital economy based on teh value of vice. A narco-anhacro-capitalist area run by hyper-optimized and competitive cartels with wealth and resources more than any previous landed nation in south and central america

the east is locked in a perpetual war of honor, reparations, and resenetment. Locked in a perpetual battle of micro-escalations, technological innovations, and war innovation, it is said that the pacific 'ring of fire' is where one goes to test their metal, might, and even tech. 
China is run by the Grand Committe of the People's Spirits....an 'ai' that is said to made up of the spirits greatest chinese to lead them into the glorious future. 
The Pacific Alliance of Human Kind is a federation of landed asian and oceanic states that, while dispirate, intend to invade china and dispose of the AI at the central leadership of China 

In Europe, Great Britan attempted to re-annex Ireland for the appearance of a isles united front thru essentially holding the country hostage thru the use of low-yield nuclear mines. What happened next is the exact opposite of what they wanted to happen. The Irish simply disarmed every mine, smuggled them into parliament, and blew the fuck out of English parliament. To the rest of the world, it seems that the united isles are irradiated and desolate

Eastern Europe is slowly being devowered by the resurgance of the return of the new messiah, the longest living pope of all time. of 100 years. it is said that the vatican possesses technology beyond that of even the techno-empires. A crusade of millions washes over europe, ereadicating prodestantism 

Jerusalem, Israel, the middle east, and the indian subcontinent now peacefully occupy the holy land ment to be a refuge and last bastion of relgious freedom agains the eternal crusade. 


The continent of Africa is now the world's gateway to space as well as its last cornocopia. Thru technological innovation, sand from the sahara is used as bio-silicoln and other technological infrastructure that the world needs to operate. it also serves as the largest non-synthetic nutrient and protein producer in the world. The largest and most advanced cosmodrome is in africa. Africa is seen as the new land of opportunity. Where one can be and do anything from augmentation to getting a chance to live a life under the thumb. Each major techno-country has home base placed here, the starting off point to space. The techno-sates effectively run a nightwatchmen style governace where  societies are allowed to freely prosper and interact where the techno-countries only interefere to etither extract potent data and information or to quell any dissodants, violence, war, or anything that could affect the supply chain to space. 

25 years ago, first impact, basically an ultra intelligent Ai which some say incorporates secret xenobiology or brains of syntetic clone humans....a secret abandoned fascility is unearthed despite what humans nearly 1000 years ago thought would be like 'ayo don't come closer'. After revealing the secret facility, the team unfortunately powers up something called a neutrino trap. and the true secret....1000 years ago humanity went extinct. but it was saved, and reseeded by a mysterious xenospecies to regrow on earth. however, dispite how advanced they were, they could not find a way to destroy the tech that decimated old humanity without also destroying itself. So they buried it. Under Antartica. What the device is known as 'cherub' Basically this will be revealed later...but old humanity basically created the Borg. An AI that assimilates organic life for the sake of binary efficiency. So what this neutrino trap does is that its timed specifically with three pulsars. rapidly spinning stars or whatever. And when it is disrupted, that secret xenospecies that saved humanity, activates a failsafe where like idk cool artifiacts can be found around the world to hold back the borg while the aliens hopefully come to help. The idea is that cherub cannot be destroyed. It can only be hidden. The future aliens are actually a race of perfect human clones. The same person just over and over again .Like Horatio from that Paradox game.


the premise is that the future of humanity is at stake. but nobody wants to do what it takes.
