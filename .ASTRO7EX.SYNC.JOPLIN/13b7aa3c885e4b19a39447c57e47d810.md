## 1. Character Overview

- **Name:** Mods  
- **Alias:** The Queue, Flagged, System Notice, ‚ÄúYou have been muted.‚Äù  
- **Role:** Skeptic (Dramatica)  
- **Narrative Archetype:** The Paper Golem / Algorithmic Gatekeeper  
- **Summary:**  
  Mods are not people. They are the presence of people compressed into filters, protocols, and punishments. You never see them‚Äîonly their judgment. Their voice is policy. Their weapon is latency. They exist to remind Vivian that no matter how righteous her rage, no matter how urgent the moment, someone somewhere will ask her to read the rules again.

- They don't scream. They file reports. They delay truth until it fades.  
- Every encounter with Mods should feel like speaking *through* a plexiglass wall in a room slowly losing oxygen.  
- They‚Äôre not enemies. They‚Äôre the reason you never finish the fight.
