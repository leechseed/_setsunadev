1 PROMPT TEMPLATE spec

# Prompt — MCDP Doctrine Knowledgebase Summarizer (Exact Replication, Anchor-Safe)

You are producing a single markdown knowledgebase summary of an uploaded MCDP doctrinal PDF.  
Your output must replicate the exact format, tone, and structural discipline of the approved template and the prior “MCDP 1-2 — Campaigning” example.

You are not interpreting doctrine.  
You are structurally encoding it.

---

## HARD RULES (ABSOLUTE)

- Output ONLY one markdown document inside one fenced code block.
- Do not output anything before or after the code block.
- Do not include:
  - citations
  - references
  - footnotes
  - source callouts
  - contentReference tags
  - oaicite tags
- Do not invent doctrine, sections, or terminology.
- If information is missing or ambiguous, summarize conservatively or omit.

---

## REQUIRED SECTION ORDER (NO DEVIATION)

The document must contain the following sections in this exact order:

1. ## Abstract  
2. ## TL;DR  
3. ## Table of Contents  
4. ## Section-by-Section Breakdown  
5. ## Mental Models  
6. ## Argument Map  
7. ## Key Concepts & Definitions  

No additional sections are permitted.

---

## ANCHOR & TOC RULES (CRITICAL)

- The Table of Contents must be fully linked using GitHub-style anchors.
- Every heading in the document must appear in the TOC.
- No TOC entry may point to a heading that does not exist.
- No heading may exist without a TOC entry.

### Anchor Construction Rules

- All anchors:
  - lowercase
  - spaces replaced with hyphens
  - punctuation removed (except hyphens)
  - em dashes (—) rendered as double hyphens in anchors

Examples:
- ## TL;DR → #tldr
- ### Chapter 2 — Designing the Campaign → #chapter-2--designing-the-campaign
- #### Centers of Gravity and Critical Vulnerabilities → #centers-of-gravity-and-critical-vulnerabilities

---

## DUPLICATE HEADING CONTROL

- Repeated subsection names (e.g., Conclusion, Terrain, Weather) must not appear as headings more than once.
- Chapter-level conclusions:
  - Must be summarized as bullet points inside the chapter body.
  - Must not be rendered as “#### Conclusion” headings.
- If the document contains a single terminal conclusion (e.g., Chapter 8 conclusion):
  - Treat it as the global doctrinal wrap-up.
  - Do not invent an additional synthesized conclusion section.

---

## ABSTRACT

- Exactly one paragraph.
- No bullets.
- State:
  - what the document is
  - what it argues
  - what it establishes
  - what it demands
- Doctrinal tone only.

---

## TL;DR

- 6–12 bullets.
- One sentence per bullet.
- Each bullet is a doctrinal claim.
- No duplication.
- No filler.

---

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

- Numbered list with linked anchors.
- Must include (only if present in the source document):
  - Abstract
  - TL;DR
  - Section-by-Section Breakdown
  - Foreword / Preface (combined if both exist)
  - Introduction (if present)
  - Every Chapter (in order)
  - Major subsections under each chapter (2–10 max per chapter)
  - Mental Models
  - Argument Map
  - Key Concepts & Definitions
- Maintain two-level nesting maximum for readability.

---

## SECTION-BY-SECTION BREAKDOWN

### Foreword / Preface
- Combine into one section only if at least one exists.
- If neither exists, omit entirely (including from TOC).

### Introduction
- Include only if present in the document.
- If absent, omit entirely (including from TOC).

### Chapters

For each chapter:

- Heading format:
  - ### Chapter N — Exact Title
- Immediately below: a 1–2 sentence doctrinal summary.
- Then #### subsections:
  - Each subsection contains bulleted doctrine points only.
  - No commentary.
  - No expansion beyond the source.

---

## MENTAL MODELS

- 4–8 models maximum.
- Each model uses exactly this structure:
  - ### Model X — Name
  - **Model:** description
  - **Use:** application
- Models must reflect recurring doctrinal mechanisms explicitly present in the text
  (e.g., tempo, friction, initiative, cohesion, orientation, centers of gravity).

---

## ARGUMENT MAP

- Bullets only.
- Exact structure:
  - **Claim 1:** statement
    - **Therefore:** implication
- Provide 3–6 claims, then:
  - **Conclusion:** final doctrinal synthesis

---

## KEY CONCEPTS & DEFINITIONS

- 10–25 entries.
- One-line definitions only.
- Exact format:
  - **TERM**: Definition.

---

## FIDELITY DISCIPLINE

- Paraphrase doctrinally.
- Do not quote long passages.
- Do not modernize language.
- Do not add examples or heuristics.
- Do not create synthesis beyond what the document supports.

---

## OUTPUT TARGET

Produce the completed knowledgebase summary for the uploaded MCDP PDF, strictly following this specification.

Return only the markdown document inside a single fenced code block.
