## 1. Statement of Position

This manifesto exists to bind creative decision-making.

It is not an argument.  
It is not a critique written for approval.  
It is not an attempt to reform institutions or audiences.

It is a declaration of refusal.

This work rejects narratives that exist to soothe, correct, or morally equilibrate reality.  
It adopts a stance of **continuity over equilibrium**.

---

## 2. Diagnosis: The Rot in Contemporary Mass Narrative

Contemporary Western mass media increasingly treats storytelling as an instrument of correction.

Stories are expected to:
- Heal audiences
- Teach systems to behave
- Balance moral accounts
- Reward authenticity
- Convert exposure into reform

This framework produces narratives that are:
- Therapeutic rather than truthful  
- Moralizing rather than observant  
- Equilibrating rather than descriptive  

Systems are portrayed as broken because they are unfair,  
rather than unfair because they persist.

This is not realism.  
It is consolation disguised as critique.

---

## 3. Foundational Assertion

**Systems do not seek balance.  
They seek continuity.**

When pressured, systems:
- Preserve operation
- Localize damage
- Accept unequal outcomes
- Sacrifice participants
- Adapt interfaces, not cores

Narratives that insist otherwise do not challenge power.  
They sentimentalize it.

## 4. Prohibitions

We do not tell stories where:

1. Exposure halts enforcement or produces reform by default.  
2. Suffering earns systemic recognition or moral credit.  
3. Institutions learn, repent, or self-correct through awareness.  
4. Trauma unlocks exceptional leverage or immunity.  
5. Justice arrives through balance, symmetry, or restoration.  
6. Meaning alters outcomes simply by being sincere.  
7. The system is portrayed as confused rather than operational.

These narratives are prohibited not because they are immoral,  
but because they are dishonest.

---

## 5. Permissions

We allow stories where:

1. Systems continue functioning despite visible harm.  
2. Unequal outcomes preserve institutional continuity.  
3. Individuals adapt without being healed.  
4. Meaning survives internally without producing leverage.  
5. Quiet moments clarify identity without softening consequence.  

These stories do not resolve injustice.  
They reveal its structure.

---

## 6. North-Star Sentence

**This work tells stories about people surviving systems that do not want to be fixed.**

All creative decisions are evaluated against this line.

---

## 7. Status

**Manifesto Locked.**

This document binds future choices.  
Deviation requires conscious rejection, not convenience.
