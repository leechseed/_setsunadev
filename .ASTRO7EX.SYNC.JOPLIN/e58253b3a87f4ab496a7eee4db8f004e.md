# CREATE EMOTIONAL ACTION LINES — Layered Rewrite Exercise

Infuse action lines with **emotion-driven language** so they move story and deepen character impact.

---

### **1) Identify Major Action Beat**
- **ACTION LINE:**  
  > (Plain action that drives the story forward)

---

### **2) Add Emotion Descriptor**
- **EMOTION + ACTION LINE:**  
  > (Adjective or emotional cue + the action line)  
  *(e.g., “hesitant steps forward,” “furious shove,” “trembling hands close the door”)*

---

### **3) Replace Verb with Emotional Verb**
- **ACTION LINE WITH NEW VERB:**  
  > (Verb matched to underlying emotion)  
  *(e.g., swap “walks” → “storms,” “drops” → “slams,” “looks” → “glares”)*

---

### **4) Combine Emotion + Verb (High-Impact Beat)**
- **ACTION LINE WITH NEW VERB PLUS EMOTION:**  
  > (Both descriptor + strong verb)  
  *(e.g., “with desperate fury, she hurls the glass across the room”)*

---

### **Emotional Action Line Log**
| Scene ID / Title | Original Action Line | Emotion Added | Verb Replaced | Combined Emotion + Verb | Notes |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------|-------|
|                  |                      |               |               |                         |       |
|                  |                      |               |               |                         |       |
|                  |                      |               |               |                         |       |

### **Checklist**
- [ ] Each major action beat reflects the **emotional state** of the character.  
- [ ] Verbs are strong, specific, and tied to emotion.  
- [ ] Key moments get **layered treatment** (descriptor + verb).  
- [ ] No flat, neutral verbs in critical beats.
