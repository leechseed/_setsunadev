Seducing, blackmailing, and brutalizing her way up the food chain, she uncovers a cartel-political conspiracy that used partygoers as human guinea pigs. They tried to kill the wrong slut. Now she's coming for all of them.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Title:** *Velvet Vice*\\\n\\\n### **Premise**\\\nA hedonistic goth party slut — **Mina Vale** — is the reluctant anti-heroine of a spiraling conspiracy thriller. Think **Emiru** after three years of drug-fueled festivals, nihilistic OnlyFans stardom, and late-night motel OD scares — except now she’s pissed. Real pissed. \\\n\\\nOne night at **SableFest** — a savage, semi-legal desert rave — someone laces the whole batch. Hundreds die, ODing on what should've been chill molly. Her best friend **Calla** bleeds out in the sand next to her.\\\n\\\nMina survives. Barely.\\\n\\\nWhen she wakes up, she realizes this wasn’t a bad cook — it was *intentional*.  \\\nAnd it goes *way* past street pushers.  \\\nCartels. Cops. Pharma suits.  \\\nThe whole fucking food chain.\\\n\\\nThey tried to kill the wrong slut.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Mina Vale: The Character**\\\n- **Looks**: Soft Emiru face, huge eyes, pouty mouth. Always looks halfway between \\\"fuck me\\\" and \\\"fuck you.\\\" Bloodshot but captivating.\\\n- **Vibe**: Fishnets, fur jacket over nothing, combat boots caked in last night's grime.\\\n- **Habits**: Drugs, sex, guns, repeat — until *SableFest*.\\\n- **New Motto**: \\\"*Numb don't mean dumb.*\\\"\\\n\\\nShe reinvents herself as a **private shadow operator**. Not licensed. Not sane. Not particularly professional. But she's motivated — and she's got enough *dirt*, *sex appeal*, and *rage* to tear through the underground like a black-gloved tornado.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Setting**\\\n- **City**: **Neon Bastion** — a fictional hyper-Florida hellscape; imagine Miami meets Los Angeles if the ocean boiled.\\\n- **Tone**: Bright lights, wet streets, paranoia behind every nightclub door.\\\n- **Vibe**:  \\\n  - \\\"Grand Theft Auto\\\" levels of colorful scumbaggery.  \\\n  - \\\"Ready or Not\\\" levels of **tactical panic** when shit *really* breaks off.  \\\n  - No safehouses. No allies. Only escalating brutality.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Plot Arc**\\\n- **Act 1: Baptism in Blood**  \\\n  Mina scavenges the ruins of SableFest, steals evidence, and has to flee corrupt cops trying to wipe survivors.\\\n\\\n- **Act 2: Honeytrap and Hammer**  \\\n  She uses her looks and reputation to seduce her way up the ladder — low-level dealers, club owners, mid-tier enforcers — while blackmailing and black-bagging the ones who don't play nice.\\\n\\\n- **Act 3: Glass House**  \\\n  She finds out the cartel's political fronts — including the **Mayor of Neon Bastion** — greenlit a \\\"soft kill\\\" operation to *test* a new drug. SableFest was their beta.\\\n\\\n- **Act 4: Ash and Ice**  \\\n  She goes full terrorist.  \\\n  Arsons. Kidnappings. Executions broadcast on burner accounts.  \\\n  Her final target: the man who ordered the field test — a cartel-aligned biotech CEO, guarded like a dictator.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Themes**\\\n- **Rage as Clarity**: Drugs numbed her. Vengeance makes her lucid.  \\\n- **Paranoia**: Every helping hand hides a knife.  \\\n- **Sexual Power**: Weaponized, not surrendered.  \\\n- **Systemic Rot**: It’s not one bad apple — it’s a fucking orchard.  \\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Key Visuals**\\\n- Mina sliding out of a blood-smeared club in a torn mesh dress, neon behind her like a bad memory.\\\n- Hooded figures in paramilitary gear gassing a hidden rave while black vans circle the perimeter.\\\n- Drughouses burning while Mina speeds off on a stolen Ducati, laughing into the dawn.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\nYou want me to **draft an opening scene** where she wakes up after the massacre and realizes the world is about to find out how dangerous a pissed-off goth slut really is?  \\\n(Yes/no)\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4071}]"
