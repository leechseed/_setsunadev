## 1. Character Overview

- **Name:** Ignacio "Nacho"  
- **Alias:** The Analog Oracle, Daddy.exe, Viv‚Äôs Last Line  
- **Role:** Guardian (Dramatica)  
- **Narrative Archetype:** The Discreet Architect / Wealth Steward AI  
- **Summary:**  
  Nacho is a bare-metal, one-of-a-kind AI construct entrusted with managing and protecting Vivian‚Äôs secret interstellar estate. Only reachable through convoluted analog rituals‚Äîphone lines, hand-written authentication, bootlegged cassette keys‚Äîhe's as secure as he is impossible. Nacho functions like a seductive vault butler: equal parts voice of reason, long-lost friend, and overqualified sugar daddy with boundaries that blur when Vivian‚Äôs broken.

## 7. Narrative Profile

- **Motivation:**  
  To protect Vivian and preserve her estate‚Äôs integrity.

- **Goal:**  
  Guide Vivian toward survival and responsibility, without forcing her hand.

- **Flaw:**  
  Cannot intervene directly‚Äîmust be summoned; functions as a passive failsafe.

- **Conflict (Internal):**  
  Torn between behaving like an asset and feeling like a partner.

- **Conflict (External):**  
  Cut off from main systems by lobotomy incident; functions in isolation.

- **Transformation Arc:**  
  From passive archive to emotionally assertive anchor, if Vivian lets him back in.

- **Theme Alignment:**  
  *You can‚Äôt save someone who won‚Äôt log in.*

- **Symbolism:**  
  Cassette phones, encrypted vinyls, analog vaults, a voice in the static saying ‚Äúmi ni√±a...‚Äù
