[Status](#6-status)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 1. Structural Theory – *Understanding* as Concern\\\n\\\n### **Definition**\\\n\\\n* **Understanding**: Appreciating the meaning of something—seeing through the form into its *purpose*, *origin*, or *implication*.\\\n* It is not *knowledge* (which is static), nor is it *learning* (which is active). It is a *cognitive synthesis*—the point where comprehension becomes clarity.\\\n\\\n### **Dramatica Placement**\\\n\\\n* Domain: **Physics**\\\n* Concern Quad:\\\n\\\n  * **Doing**\\\n  * **Obtaining**\\\n  * **Learning**\\\n  * **Understanding** ✅ *(Concern selected)*\\\n\\\n### **Dynamic Pair**\\\n\\\n* **Understanding** ↔ **Gathering Information**\\\n\\\nThis pair creates thematic pressure in ASTRO7EX: characters seek truth but only receive *data*. The world’s false systems offer *documentation*, not *comprehension*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 2. ASTRO7EX Expression – What Everyone Is Trying to Understand\\\n\\\nASTRO7EX is set in a **post-AI-collapse moon colony** ruled by dead protocols (MODS) and necrotic myth (MORN). The world is full of characters who are **active**, but fundamentally **confused**—not about *what* they’re doing, but *why* they are doing it.\\\n\\\n### 🧠 Primary Sphere of Concern: *What does any of this mean?*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Core Questions Shared Across the Story**:\\\n\\\n* What *really* caused the Collapse?\\\n* What *was* AN7L—prophet, AI, ghost, or god?\\\n* What do the lobotomized crewmates *remember*?\\\n* What is the meaning of the “Moon War” history being erased or re-written?\\\n* What does it mean that *action persists* even after understanding is lost?\\\n\\\nThe characters are united not by purpose, but by **conflicted epistemology**—they cannot agree on meaning because **meaning has been weaponized**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 3. Character-by-Character Breakdown\\\n\\\n### 🧬 **Vivian (Main Character)**\\\n\\\n* **Seeks Understanding of**: Her mythologized past, the betrayal of her crew, and the silent war being erased.\\\n* **Conflict**: She is *aware* of things she cannot *understand*. Her fame makes truth unreachable.\\\n* **Expression**: Uses analog tools and memory-dives to *reclaim meaning* from MODS-controlled history.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🪨 **MODS (Impact Character)**\\\n\\\n* **Seeks Understanding of**: *Nothing.* MODS don’t seek—they enforce.\\\n* **Conflict**: They *impede* understanding. Their static rules only allow input/output, not synthesis.\\\n* **Expression**: Error messages, denial of metaphysical queries—MODS are a firewall against understanding.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🗿 **Fiona (Contagonist)**\\\n\\\n* **Seeks Understanding of**: *Power through transaction*. She believes everything can be explained via desire.\\\n* **Conflict**: Treats mystery as leverage. She’s allergic to moral understanding.\\\n* **Expression**: Uses emotional clarity to seduce Vivian away from deeper truths.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 💼 **Nacho (Guardian)**\\\n\\\n* **Seeks Understanding of**: Duty, loyalty, and the limits of his analog oath.\\\n* **Conflict**: Torn between following operational legacy or interpreting a greater truth.\\\n* **Expression**: Attempts to translate financial, technical, and emotional truths into analog language Vivian can grasp.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 👻 **Myrtle (Sidekick)**\\\n\\\n* **Seeks Understanding of**: *What happened to her?* She is fragmented.\\\n* **Conflict**: She is a living symptom of memory corruption.\\\n* **Expression**: Asks questions with no answers—forces others to confront the dissonance between experience and record.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 👑 **John Smith the Eternal (Antagonist)**\\\n\\\n* **Seeks Understanding of**: Why his program was revived.\\\n* **Conflict**: Believes the resurrection was divine; refuses to understand it was about a *bitcoin wallet*.\\\n* **Expression**: Constructs false epistemology to justify his mythic continuity.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🏛️ **The Committee (Skeptic)**\\\n\\\n* **Seeks Understanding of**: Only what’s *permissible*. They gatekeep meaning.\\\n* **Conflict**: Understanding is dangerous—it’s destabilizing to their control.\\\n* **Expression**: Sanitize narratives, redact reports, neutralize anyone with unauthorized truth.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 4. Thematic Analysis – Bloom, McKee, Anime, Astrology\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **📚 Harold Bloom — The Anxiety of Understanding**\\\n\\\n* ASTRO7EX enacts Bloom’s idea of **revisionist truth**: each character tries to *author* the story by overwriting history.\\\n* Vivian is a **strong misreader**: she challenges canonical narratives forced upon her.\\\n* Understanding becomes a **Gnostic rite**—illumination through pain.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **🎞️ 2000s Anime — *Knowing ≠ Understanding***\\\n\\\n* *Serial Experiments Lain*: Knowing everything creates madness—not clarity.\\\n* *Ergo Proxy*: Understanding the self is the path to apocalypse.\\\n* *Evangelion*: Characters pursue meaning through *others*, only to realize meaning is internal—but corrupted.\\\n\\\nUnderstanding isn’t just hard. It’s **dangerous**. In ASTRO7EX, truth does not liberate—it *disfigures*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **📖 McKee — Story = Meaning Made Expressive**\\\n\\\n* McKee stresses **true meaning is found through structure**.\\\n* ASTRO7EX shows characters acting without structure, therefore **trapped in misinterpretation**.\\\n* The story is a **collision of actions without meaning**, producing the void that Vivian must navigate.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **🌠 Narrative Astrology**\\\n\\\n#### Vivian’s Natal Chart:\\\n\\\n* **Mercury in Aries** square **Saturn in Capricorn**:\\\n\\\n  * She’s *impulsive with truth* but resented by authority for speaking it.\\\n* **Chiron in Gemini**: Her *wound is in miscommunication and misunderstood legacy*.\\\n\\\n#### Transits:\\\n\\\n* Uranus transit her IC: *truth erupts from roots*.\\\n* Neptune square Mercury: She cannot distinguish real understanding from illusion.\\\n\\\n#### Progressions:\\\n\\\n* Progressed Moon into Scorpio: Deep intuition, painful clarity.\\\n* Progressed Mercury Retrograde: Truth now moves **backward**—she must *un-understand* what she was taught.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 5. Summary – How ASTRO7EX Illustrates “Understanding” as Overall Story Concern\\\n\\\nIn ASTRO7EX, **Understanding** functions as the shared emotional and cognitive battlefield. Every major character is either:\\\n\\\n* **Desperate for meaning**,\\\n* **Deluded by meaning**, or\\\n* **Controlling meaning**.\\\n\\\nThe tragedy of the story is that **understanding is impossible under a system designed to confuse**. The MODS, the Committee, and MORN operate on logic trees, myths, and silence. They permit data—not comprehension.\\\n\\\nVivian’s story—and the Overall Story—unfolds as a collective search for *what things meant*, even as those meanings are destroyed in real time. Characters fight to reconstruct the past not for nostalgia, but for **liberation from encoded futures**.\\\n\\\nThis aligns structurally with the Dramatica Concern, thematically with Bloom and McKee, spiritually with narrative astrology, and emotionally with 2000s anime protagonists who find that **understanding comes too late, or costs too much**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 6.
