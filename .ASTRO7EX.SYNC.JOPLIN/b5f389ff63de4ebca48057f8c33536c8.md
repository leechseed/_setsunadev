Playing fair guarantees loss → characters must cheat.\\\n2. Cheating destabilizes the system → the system sacrifices people.\\\n3. Sacrifice threatens legitimacy → the system rewrites identity.\\\n\\\nThere is no clean rebellion.  \\\nThere is no final truth-state.  \\\nThere is no stable outside perspective.\\\n\\\nEvery outcome feeds back into the system.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Misuses and Failure Modes\\\n\\\nAvoid the following:\\\n\\\n- Treating invariants as themes instead of constraints\\\n- Letting protagonists “earn” exemption\\\n- Allowing reform to succeed without rupture\\\n- Granting historical vindication as reward\\\n- Using sacrifice as spectacle instead of mechanism\\\n\\\nThese errors soften the system and collapse tension.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Practical Usage Rules\\\n\\\n- **During writing**: ask which invariant is under pressure in the scene.\\\n- **During editing**: remove outcomes that bypass cost, sacrifice, or revision.\\\n- **During worldbuilding**: only add institutions that reinforce at least one invariant.\\\n- **During revision**: if something feels comforting, interrogate it.\\\n\\\nComfort is usually a violation.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Summary\\\n\\\nThese three invariants define the IP’s **moral physics**:\\\n\\\n- Action requires illegitimacy.\\\n- Systems stabilize through sacrifice.\\\n- Identity is controlled after the fact.\\\n\\\nThey do not promise hope.  \\\nThey do not eliminate agency.\\\n\\\nThey define the **terrain on which meaning is fought**.\\\n\\\nEnd of document.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5833}]"
