body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"AMERICAN PHAROAH\\\nFoaled February 2, 2012 — Born to Rewrite History\\\n\\\nGreatness never asks permission. It waits for no invitation. It arrives—silent, undeniable, inevitable.\\\n\\\nIn the rolling fields of Kentucky, beneath quiet February skies, greatness arrived. They named him American Pharoah. A name that carried promise. A name soon feared by rivals, whispered by believers, etched by destiny.\\\n\\\nFrom the start, American Pharoah moved differently—calm eyes, quiet presence, unshakable composure. Even standing still, you felt the storm beneath that blue-blooded skin. Bob Baffert saw it early: a stride longer than Secretariat’s, effortless, ruthless, relentless.\\\n\\\nBut greatness is tested. Injury threatened early, doubt circled constantly. Could this colt be the one? Could he break the 37-year drought?\\\n\\\nThe answer came emphatic.\\\n\\\nKentucky Derby—American Pharoah roared past rivals, a blaze of power and promise.\\\n\\\nPreakness—through driving rain and suffocating mud, he surged seven lengths clear, untouchable.\\\n\\\nThen Belmont. A mile-and-a-half graveyard for champions. Gates slammed open, rivals rattled, American Pharoah stayed quiet, composed, curious. History surrendered at the first stride. He moved effortlessly, five and a half lengths clear, carrying the weight of a nation without strain.\\\n\\\nAmerican Pharoah didn’t just win. He dominated. He didn’t just race. He redefined.\\\n\\\nSpeed and strength. Grace and defiance. A champion who made the impossible look inevitable.\\\n\\\nGreatness had arrived—and the name echoes forever.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1524}]"
