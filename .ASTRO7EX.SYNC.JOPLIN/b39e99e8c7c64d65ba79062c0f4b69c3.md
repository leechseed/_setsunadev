truths exist in a story and which truths outrank others**.\\\n\\\nThey exist to:\\\n- Prevent rule confusion  \\\n- Stop character exceptionalism  \\\n- Enforce thematic and systemic coherence  \\\n- Provide a stable foundation for scaling  \\\n\\\nIf scaling answers *how far consequences spread*, ontology answers *what cannot change*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## What “Ontological” Means in Narrative\\\n\\\nIn this framework, **ontology** refers to:\\\n\\\n> The hierarchy of constraints that govern narrative reality, independent of presentation or taste.\\\n\\\nOntological layers answer questions like:\\\n- What must always be true?\\\n- What may change, and at what cost?\\\n- What cannot be overridden by clever writing?\\\n\\\nOntological layers are **not story beats or techniques**.  \\\nThey are **structural facts about how the narrative universe operates**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## The Ontological Layer Stack (Lowest → Highest)\\\n\\\nFrom most fundamental (least flexible) to most expressive (most flexible):\\\n\\\n> **Reality → Meaning → Power → Experience → Expression → Argument → Perception**\\\n\\\nLower layers constrain higher layers.  \\\nHigher layers may express or interpret lower layers, but never alter them.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Layer-by-Layer Definitions\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Layer 0 — Ontological Reality\\\n**(Hard constraint layer)**\\\n\\\n### Definition  \\\nThe fundamental rules of existence in the story world.\\\n\\\n### Governs\\\n- Reality / ontology  \\\n- Time  \\\n- Causality  \\\n- Permanence  \\\n- Entropy / decay  \\\n- Scale invariance  \\\n\\\n### Core Question  \\\n> *What is true even if no one is alive to witness it?*\\\n\\\n### Invariants Belong Here\\\n- Time does not reverse  \\\n- Actions have irreversible consequences  \\\n- Decay cannot be fully halted  \\\n\\\n### Failure Mode\\\n- Retcons  \\\n- Exceptions for protagonists  \\\n- World rules that change to save plot\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Layer 1 — Value & Meaning Logic\\\n**(Moral constraint layer)**\\\n\\\n### Definition  \\\nThe system by which actions gain or lose significance.\\\n\\\n### Governs\\\n- Meaning  \\\n- Values  \\\n- Moral logic  \\\n- Hope vs futility  \\\n- Purpose  \\\n\\\n### Core Question  \\\n> *What does the universe reward, punish, or ignore?*\\\n\\\n### Invariants Belong Here\\\n- Success carries cost  \\\n- Power corrupts outcomes  \\\n- Hope is not guaranteed  \\\n\\\n### Failure Mode\\\n- Theme drift  \\\n- Moral reversals without consequence  \\\n- Genre incoherence\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Layer 2 — Power & Systemic Force\\\n**(Authority and enforcement layer)**\\\n\\\n### Definition  \\\nThe structures that determine who can cause change.\\\n\\\n### Governs\\\n- Power  \\\n- Authority  \\\n- Violence  \\\n- Coercion  \\\n- Institutions  \\\n- Systems and enforcement  \\\n\\\n### Core Question  \\\n> *Who gets to decide what happens—and why?*\\\n\\\n### Invariants Belong Here\\\n- Power is asymmetrical  \\\n- Systems resist disruption  \\\n- Authority persists beyond individuals  \\\n\\\n### Failure Mode\\\n- Power fantasy escalation  \\\n- Lone-hero system fixes  \\\n- Unopposed protagonists\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Layer 3 — Human Interface\\\n**(Experiential layer)**\\\n\\\n### Definition  \\\nHow ontological rules are experienced by individuals.\\\n\\\n### Governs\\\n- Characters  \\\n- Identity  \\\n- Desire  \\\n- Agency  \\\n- Relationships  \\\n- Trauma and emotion  \\\n\\\n### Core Question  \\\n> *What does it feel like to live under these constraints?*\\\n\\\n### Important Rule  \\\n> This layer **does not define invariants**.  \\\n> It manifests constraints imposed by lower layers.\\\n\\\n### Failure Mode\\\n- Characters overriding systems  \\\n- Psychology rewriting reality  \\\n- “Special” characters immune to rules\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Layer 4 — Expression Mechanics\\\n**(Transmission layer)**\\\n\\\n### Definition  \\\nHow pressure and meaning move moment-to-moment.\\\n\\\n### Governs\\\n- Dialogue  \\\n- Silence  \\\n- Subtext  \\\n- Action  \\\n- Decision  \\\n- Conflict mechanics  \\\n\\\n### Core Question  \\\n> *How is pressure transmitted right now?*\\\n\\\n### Invariants Belong Here\\\n- Speech is action  \\\n- Conflict escalates  \\\n- Silence has force  \\\n\\\n### Failure Mode\\\n- Decorative dialogue  \\\n- Static scenes  \\\n- Exposition replacing action\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Layer 5 — Structural Argument\\\n**(Proof layer)**\\\n\\\n### Definition  \\\nHow the story demonstrates its claim over time.\\\n\\\n### Governs\\\n- Structure  \\\n- Progression  \\\n- Arcs  \\\n- Turning points  \\\n- Throughlines  \\\n- Payoff logic  \\\n\\\n### Core Question  \\\n> *What claim is the story making, and how does it prove it?*\\\n\\\n### Invariants Belong Here\\\n- Change is irreversible  \\\n- All perspectives matter  \\\n- Outcomes follow choices  \\\n\\\n### Failure Mode\\\n- Episodic drift  \\\n- Unproven themes  \\\n- False climaxes\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Layer 6 — Delivery & Perception\\\n**(Epistemic layer)**\\\n\\\n### Definition  \\\nHow the audience receives and interprets the story.\\\n\\\n### Governs\\\n- Point of view  \\\n- Tone  \\\n- Genre framing  \\\n- Audience contract  \\\n- What is hidden or unsaid  \\\n\\\n### Core Question  \\\n> *How is meaning framed for the audience?*\\\n\\\n### Invariants Belong Here\\\n- Fairness  \\\n- Consistency  \\\n- Earned payoff  \\\n\\\n### Failure Mode\\\n- Tone whiplash  \\\n- Broken audience trust  \\\n- Misdirection without setup\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Rules of Interaction Between Layers\\\n\\\n1. **Lower layers constrain higher layers**  \\\n2. **Higher layers express lower layers**  \\\n3. **No layer may override a lower layer**  \\\n4. **Violations propagate upward and destabilize scale**\\\n\\\nIf a higher layer requires changing a lower one, the system is broken.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Ontological Violations\\\n\\\n- Character growth altering moral physics  \\\n- Tone demanding rule exceptions  \\\n- Structure retconning causality  \\\n- Dialogue explaining away systemic limits  \\\n\\\nMost narrative incoherence is ontological, not stylistic.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## How Ontological Layers Support Scaling (Preview)\\\n\\\n- Small scale activates higher layers only  \\\n- Large scale activates deeper layers simultaneously  \\\n- Scaling widens consequence radius without changing ontology  \\\n\\\nThe next knowledgebase entry will formalize **how scaling and ontological layers interact**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6913}]"
