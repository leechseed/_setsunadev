# MAKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTER BAD — Flaw Amplification Worksheet

Identify scenes where your **Main Character (MC)** should read as more flawed. Apply the act-specific prompts below to encode visible, trackable shortcomings and their evolution.

---

### **Act 1 — Amusingly Selfish Choice**
- **Prompt:** Write in a **selfish choice** you’d never do (but secretly wish you could). Keep it **amusing** and clearly self-serving.  
- **Beat Notes:**  
  - Setup the **habit** or **rule** this selfishness implies.  
  - Ensure a **minor cost** to someone else.  
- **Draft Line / Moment:**  
  > 

---

### **Act 2A — Annoying Character Rule (Turn It Up)**
- **Prompt:** Define a specific, **annoying rule** your MC lives by (e.g., “never wait,” “always correct people,” “no shoes indoors—ever”).  
- **Beat Notes:**  
  - Make it **impossible to ignore** in group scenes.  
  - Show **social friction** or tactical costs.  
- **The Rule (verbatim):**  
  > 
- **Escalation Tactics:**  
  - [ ] Force the rule to **conflict** with an ally’s need.  
  - [ ] Create a **ticking inconvenience** tied to the rule.  
  - [ ] Have the rule **block progress** at a key moment.

---

### **Act 2B — Terribleness With Utility (Fun/Useful to Others)**
- **Prompt:** Show the **fun** in the MC’s worst traits by making them **useful or entertaining** to someone else.  
- **Beat Notes:**  
  - Highlight **perverse incentives** (people start relying on the flaw).  
  - Let another character **praise** or **reward** the bad behavior.  
- **Use-Case (who benefits & how):**  
  > 
- **Scene Payload:**  
  - [ ] The flaw **solves a problem** or **wins a moment**.  
  - [ ] Someone **encourages** the flaw.  
  - [ ] MC receives a **short-term win / dopamine hit**.

---

### **Act 3 — Break the Annoying Rule (Visible Change)**
- **Prompt:** Stage a **clear, on-screen violation** of the Act 2A rule to demonstrate growth.  
- **Beat Notes:**  
  - Tie the break to a **meaningful cost** or **sacrifice**.  
  - Contrast with the **Act 1 selfishness** to show evolution.  
- **Rule-Break Moment (what, where, why it matters):**  
  > 
- **Aftermath Signal:**  
  - [ ] Relationship repair or **trust gain**  
  - [ ] **Opportunity unlocked** that the rule once blocked  
  - [ ] **Self-concept shift** (micro-mono­logue, gesture, or choice)
