PROLOGUE STORYFORM - EPISODE 1

# PROLOGUE STORYFORM — EPISODE 1
**Working Title:** The Purge of MAXWING  
**Function:** Establish the post-collapse *situation* and lock Vivian into her Steadfast/Stop vector.

## Story Dynamics
- **Driver:** Decision → choices trigger cascading crackdowns
- **Limit:** Optionlock → only a few extraction/cover options remain
- **Outcome:** Failure → extraction fails; program collapses
- **Judgment:** Bad → Vivian ends worse off, psychologically raw
- **MC Resolve/Growth/Approach/Style:** Steadfast • Stop • Do-er • Linear

## Throughlines

### Overall Story (OS)
- **Domain:** Universe (Situation)
- **Concern:** Progress (the accelerating purge of MAXWING)
- **Issue:** Security vs. Threat
- **Problem / Solution:** **Control** → **Uncontrolled**
- **Symptom / Response:** **Avoid** ↔ **Pursue**
- **Goal:** Preserve the unit (MAXWING) and cover identities
- **Consequence:** Future is foreclosed (blacklists, lunar exile)
- **Requirements:** Destroy evidence; extract key operatives
- **Forewarnings:** Program “health” metrics nosedive; arrests begin
- **Catalyst / Inhibitor:** Strategy / Delay
- **Benchmark:** Present (every minute the clampdown tightens)

### Main Character (MC) — *Vivian*
- **Domain:** Mind (Fixed Attitude) — her uncompromising soldier’s creed
- **Concern:** Subconscious (rage, grief, survival compulsions)
- **Issue:** Closure vs. Denial
- **Problem / Solution:** **Reconsider** → **Consider**
- **Unique Ability:** Tenacity (lets her outlast the purge)
- **Critical Flaw:** Vengeance (misallocates scarce options)

### Impact Character (IC) — *John Smith the Eternal*
- **Domain:** Psychology (Manipulation) — indoctrination, “company religion”
- **Concern:** Being (the role he imposes on every operative)
- **Issue:** Rationalization vs. Obligation
- **Problem / Solution:** **Logic** → **Feeling**
- **IC Function:** He embodies the system’s seductive certainty

### Relationship (RS) — *Vivian ↔ John Smith*
- **Domain:** Physics (Activity)
- **Concern:** Doing (orders executed vs. defied)
- **Issue:** Skill vs. Experience
- **Problem / Solution:** **Pursuit** → **Avoid**
- **Benchmark:** Learning (each “lesson” corrodes trust)

## Plot Progressions (Signposts → brief beats)

### OS (Universe / Progress)

2. **Present:** On-base lockdown; friends disappear  
3. **Past:** Vivian uncovers original “holy mission” lies  
4. **Future:** Exile to lunar underbelly becomes inevitable

### MC (Mind)
1. **Memory:** Flash fragments of training & cost  
2. **Conscious:** Cold calculus: who can be saved  
3. **Preconscious:** Instinctive violence in a raid  
4. **Subconscious:** Vow: *never submit to dead code again*

### IC (Psychology)
1. **Conceiving:** John seeds “necessary sacrifices”  
2. **Being:** He performs the benevolent patriarch  
3. **Becoming:** The mask slips—pure instrumentality  
4. **Conceptualizing:** He frames betrayal as promotion

### RS (Physics)
1. **Learning:** She decodes his techniques  
2. **Understanding:** The “father” is a mechanism  
3. **Doing:** She refuses a final order  
4. **Obtaining:** Break—she severs affiliation

## Bridge to Ep. 3
- Locks in **exile/situation** that Episode 3 will *act* upon.
