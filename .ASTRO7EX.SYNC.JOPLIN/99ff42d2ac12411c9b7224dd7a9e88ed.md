body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# Deep Throat Training Protocol – Gag Reflex Desensitization\\\n\\\n## Objective\\\nIncrease oral capacity, control, and endurance through progressive, daily training. Focus on reflex desensitization, neck/throat relaxation, and performance confidence.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Daily Structure (10–20 min)\\\n1. **Warm-Up (2–3 min)**\\\n   - Tongue stretches (stick out, hold 30 sec)\\\n   - Jaw rolls, neck circles\\\n   - Deep breathing through nose only\\\n\\\n2. **Desensitization (5–10 min)**\\\n   - Use mirror\\\n   - Start with clean fingers or small dildo\\\n   - Touch back of tongue/throat gently\\\n   - Repeat light contact until gag reflex reduces\\\n\\\n3. **Deep Insertion Practice (5–7 min)**\\\n   - Use dildo/cock trainer\\\n   - Lube + relaxed jaw\\\n   - Insert to first resistance, then breathe and hold\\\n   - Pull out slowly, then reinsert a little deeper\\\n   - Track duration of hold without gag\\\n\\\n4. **Cooldown (2–3 min)**\\\n   - Massage jaw and throat\\\n   - Drink water slowly while breathing through nose\\\n   - Optional: suck ice cube or cold water gargle\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Weekly Progression Goals\\\n| Week | Depth Target | Hold Time Goal | Notes |\\\n|------|--------------|----------------|-------|\\\n| 1    | Mid-tongue contact | 3 sec hold | Focus on relaxing gag reflex |\\\n| 2    | Soft palate touch | 5 sec hold | Master breathing through nose |\\\n| 3    | Near full insertion | 7 sec hold | Add light thrusting or motion |\\\n| 4    | Full base contact | 10+ sec hold | Emphasize endurance + stillness |\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Tips for Success\\\n- **Always breathe through nose.**\\\n- **Relax your face, not just throat.**\\\n- **Lube generously.**\\\n- **Don’t rush depth – respect resistance.**\\\n- Use **visualization or porn audio** if it helps soften resistance.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Optional Enhancements\\\n- Perform in front of mirror to reinforce visual control\\\n- Record session for feedback or self-review\\\n- Pair with edging session for reward conditioning\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Final Reminder\\\nThis is not just skill. This is **control**. The throat is a gate — you’re learning how to open it, hold it, and command it.\\\n\\\n**Breathe. Relax. Swallow it all.**\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2049}]"
