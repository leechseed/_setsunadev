## Overview

**Claim Types define what kinds of truths this system is capable of proving.**  
They are not themes, morals, or messages.

Each claim must be demonstrated through **repetition**, **consequence**, and **risk of falsification**.  
If a claim cannot survive contradiction, it is not structurally proven.

---

## Claim Types

---

### 1. Constraint Claims  
**What systems make impossible, regardless of intent.**

- **Claim Form**: “Under these conditions, **no choice allows X to happen**.”
- **Proof Method**: Repeated attempts fail for structural reasons, not personal flaws.
- **Typical Evidence**: Enforcement persists; isolation holds; accumulation outpaces resistance.
- **Disproof Risk**: A single clean escape invalidates the claim.
- **Common Failure**: Blaming individuals instead of structures.

---

### 2. Cost Claims  
**What survival or action permanently costs.**

- **Claim Form**: “To achieve or endure X, Y is lost forever.”
- **Proof Method**: Irreversible residue compounds across arcs.
- **Typical Evidence**: Relationships degrade; identities narrow; options close.
- **Disproof Risk**: Restoration, forgiveness-as-reset, costless victory.
- **Common Failure**: Treating suffering as seasoning instead of structural loss.

---

### 3. Power Claims  
**How power behaves when challenged.**

- **Claim Form**: “When confronted, power does Z.”
- **Proof Method**: Resistance consistently triggers predictable responses.
- **Typical Evidence**: Outsourcing; isolation; enforcement without legitimacy.
- **Disproof Risk**: Exposure alone halting enforcement.
- **Common Failure**: Treating power as a moral actor instead of a mechanism.

---

### 4. Legibility Claims  
**What the system can and cannot recognize.**

- **Claim Form**: “Only X is visible, rewarded, or punished.”
- **Proof Method**: Repeated invisibility of sincere but illegible acts.
- **Typical Evidence**: Inputs matter; beliefs do not. Pain is ignored.
- **Disproof Risk**: Internal states producing outcomes directly.
- **Common Failure**: Smuggling justice through recognition.

---

### 5. Agency Claims  
**What choice can and cannot accomplish.**

- **Claim Form**: “Choice affects outcomes **without altering constraints**.”
- **Proof Method**: Outcomes follow choices, but rules remain unchanged.
- **Typical Evidence**: Different choices yield different costs, not different systems.
- **Disproof Risk**: Exceptional choices bypassing constraint.
- **Common Failure**: Confusing agency with freedom.

---

### 6. Persistence Claims  
**What survives over time.**

- **Claim Form**: “Left unattended, X grows, decays, or dominates.”
- **Proof Method**: Accumulation outpaces opposition across acts.
- **Typical Evidence**: Power consolidates; integrity erodes without upkeep.
- **Disproof Risk**: Stability without maintenance.
- **Common Failure**: Treating time as neutral.

---

### 7. Meaning Claims  
**Where meaning exists—and where it does not.**

- **Claim Form**: “Meaning can exist without effect.”
- **Proof Method**: Characters retain dignity without altering outcomes.
- **Typical Evidence**: Layer 3 expressions persist under isolation.
- **Disproof Risk**: Meaning producing leverage, immunity, or altered enforcement **by default**.
- **Common Failure**: Letting inner resolution equal external change.

---

### 8. Collapse Claims  
**How and where systems fail.**

- **Claim Form**: “Systems fail only when X occurs.”
- **Proof Method**: Near-failures accumulate but do not break the system until a specific condition fails.
- **Typical Evidence**: Leakage; overload; contradiction; unsustainable maintenance.
- **Disproof Risk**: Arbitrary collapse or villain defeat.
- **Common Failure**: Treating collapse as catharsis instead of consequence **and condition**.

---

## Usage Rules

- A story may prove **multiple claim types**, but must prioritize **one dominant claim**.
- Claims must be **risked repeatedly**; counterexamples are required.
- Proof occurs through **structure**, not dialogue or declaration.
- Claims must remain valid even if the protagonist fails.

---

## Integrity Check

- Can the claim be stated in one sentence without moral language?
- Does the story attempt to disprove it before proving it?
- Would the claim still hold if the protagonist died or was wrong?

If any answer is **NO**, the claim is not structurally proven.

## Status

**Canonical Claim Type Set — Locked**  
All Layer 5 arguments must map to one or more claim types above.
