## 📚 Dramatica Theory: The Activity Domain

In Dramatica, the **Activity Domain** refers to a story world where conflict arises from what people are **doing**—not just what they are feeling or believing. In ASTRO7EX, the world is defined by procedural decay, corporate machinations, and system-level operations that perpetuate rot. Characters are engaged in:

* Hiding, hacking, extracting, chasing, resisting
* Administering punishment, managing loss, enforcing compliance
* Ritualized failure: rebirth cycles that lead nowhere

The *Prophets of Rot* title positions the overall story as a conflict born of movement, rot, and corrupted purpose. **The problem isn’t philosophical—it’s what people are actively doing to keep a dead world running.**

---

## 🪐 Narrative Astrology: Planetary Transits & Symbolic Motion

The Activity domain correlates with the astrological concept of **malefic transits** (e.g., Pluto-Saturn, Mars-Saturn) that represent destructive momentum. In ASTRO7EX:

* **Pluto in Capricorn** – bureaucratic decay masked as order
* **Saturn retrograde** – internalized restriction and soul-rotting responsibility
* **Mars square Neptune** – actions distorted by illusion, martyrdom through misdirected effort

This is a story about **motion gone wrong**: characters are *doing things* that accelerate collapse, not redemption.

## 🧠 Robert McKee: Action as Expression of Character

McKee insists that character is revealed through **choice under pressure**. In *Prophets of Rot*, every character’s action deepens the rot or exposes their refusal to accept change:

* Vivian **acts** against inertia—she doesn’t believe in waiting
* MODS **act** by denying action—stalling, preventing, delaying
* Fiona sells comfort as performance—her action is seductive stillness
* Nacho keeps **archiving**, protecting, preserving: motion within containment

Conflict manifests in attempts to push, escape, delete, or override systemic corruption.

## 📖 Harold Bloom: American Themes in Action

Bloom’s mythic American archetype is the **exiled self**—the individual whose authenticity is punished by consensus. In *Prophets of Rot*, this punishment is carried out by action:

* Vivian is constantly **flagged**, **banned**, **silenced**
* The MODS act like a courtroom that never closes
* The machine gods are still processing sins from a dead religion

This story shows how **action is punished** when it doesn’t conform to **rotted-out rules**. Even **movement is betrayal** in a decayed system.

---

## 🧬 Jeff Lyons: Moral Premise Meets Movement

Lyons emphasizes **moral architecture through behavior**. The moral axis of *Prophets of Rot* is:

> When we act based on corrupted memory, we risk becoming monsters; when we accept our brokenness and choose meaning, we become whole.

Characters act on ghost-data, bad memory, trauma remnants. Their **behavior is reactive**, **looped**, and **narratively viral**. The plot unfolds as failed attempts to act morally in a morally unavailable system.

## 🎭 Shakespearean Parallels: Action as Tragedy and Decay

Shakespeare’s tragedies often hinge on flawed action—where the **activity of the protagonist accelerates their doom** rather than averting it. In *Hamlet*, delayed action becomes corruption. In *Macbeth*, over-action becomes madness. In *King Lear*, misjudged action shatters the kingdom.

In *Prophets of Rot*, we see a Shakespearean structure:

* **The system is already broken** (Lear’s kingdom / ASTRO7EX bureaucracy)
* **Action hastens downfall** (Macbeth’s ambition / MODS' enforcement)
* **Ghosts of memory drive behavior** (Banquo / Penelope / neural echoes)
* **Corruption is enacted, not just endured**—a spiritual rot expressed through movement

Shakespeare gives us the template for a decaying world where action is both **necessary and fatal**—a lens ASTRO7EX weaponizes fully.

## 🎌 2000s Anime Archetypes: Action vs Meaning

ASTRO7EX draws heavily from postmodern anime where **activity becomes existential punishment**:

* **Texhnolyze** – movement accelerates meaninglessness
* **Ergo Proxy** – motion is a symptom of misdiagnosed soul-searching
* **Lain** – to act is to disappear
* **Cowboy Bebop** – forward motion hides broken identity

Vivian and the others are not **fighting a villain**, they’re **trying to survive in an ecosystem that penalizes activity**. Movement becomes martyrdom.

## 🎯 Summary: How *Prophets of Rot* Illustrates an Overall Story About Activity

---
### **Summary**
*Prophets of Rot* presents a world where unceasing activity masks systemic collapse. In Dramatica terms, the Overall Story Throughline centers on **Activity**—not as heroic momentum, but as futile, compulsive motion. Every character is caught in the gears of decaying machinery, performing tasks that no longer serve purpose. The narrative doesn’t depict people failing to act—it shows action as the very means of destruction. In this world, *doing* is decay, and silence is sacrilege.

---

### **Core Concept**
- **Activity**: The story’s problems arise from **doing**—from relentless motion, enforcement, and reaction.
- **Function**: Activity isn’t productive; it’s ritualized maintenance of collapse. The story explores the futility of effort in a world past redemption.

---

### **Behavioral Traits of the Overall Story**
- **Compulsive Motion**
  - Characters don’t stop moving—but not because they’re progressing.
  - Motion is a reflex: scavenging, scrubbing, enforcing, hiding.
  - Every action delays rot, but deepens it.

- **Rot as Process, Not Event**
  - Collapse isn’t a bang; it’s maintenance.
  - The more they *do*, the more they enable the system’s long death.
  - Action preserves the illusion of control.

---

### **Narrative Infrastructure**
- **Survival as Labor**
  - Every faction, every role, is built on **endless upkeep**.
  - Soldiers enforce. Cleaners cleanse. Prophets prophesy.
  - No one questions the rituals—they just keep performing them.

- **Decay Is Institutionalized**
  - Rotten structures are shored up instead of razed.
  - The system writes protocols for its own decomposition.
  - Denial is outsourced to procedure.

---

### **Conflict Engine**
- **Doing Becomes the Enemy**
  - The more the characters act, the more entangled they become.
  - They do not resist collapse—they rehearse it.
  - Every effort is a loop: enforce → erode → enforce.

- **Stillness Is Rebellion**
  - To stop is treason.
  - Silence is sacrilege.
  - Inaction is the only meaningful act left.

---

### **Impact on the Ensemble**
- **No One Is Immune**
  - Even prophets are workers.
  - Even rebels are rule-followers.
  - Their defiance is labor. Their labor is complicity.

> “They are not building a future. They are maintaining a corpse.”

---

### **Climactic Statement**
- **No one slows the rot. They schedule it.**
- **No one escapes collapse. They organize it.**

In this story, the apocalypse doesn’t come.  
It’s rescheduled—*daily*, by hand.

---

### **Final Insight**
- **The world is not falling apart because people are doing nothing.**
- **It’s falling apart because they won’t stop doing.**

This is not dystopia—it’s **maintenance horror**.

> *The machine doesn’t run. It grinds.*

---

### **Tagline**
**ASTRO7EX** isn’t about heroes fighting the end.  
It’s about **workers maintaining it**—ritual by ritual, act by act,  
until the whole world forgets it ever needed meaning.
