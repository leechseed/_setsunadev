# **Title:** *Velvet Vice*

### **Premise**
A hedonistic goth party slut — **Mina Vale** — is the reluctant anti-heroine of a spiraling conspiracy thriller. Think **Emiru** after three years of drug-fueled festivals, nihilistic OnlyFans stardom, and late-night motel OD scares — except now she’s pissed. Real pissed. 

One night at **SableFest** — a savage, semi-legal desert rave — someone laces the whole batch. Hundreds die, ODing on what should've been chill molly. Her best friend **Calla** bleeds out in the sand next to her.

Mina survives. Barely.

When she wakes up, she realizes this wasn’t a bad cook — it was *intentional*.  
And it goes *way* past street pushers.  
Cartels. Cops. Pharma suits.  
The whole fucking food chain.

They tried to kill the wrong slut.

### **Mina Vale: The Character**
- **Looks**: Soft Emiru face, huge eyes, pouty mouth. Always looks halfway between "fuck me" and "fuck you." Bloodshot but captivating.
- **Vibe**: Fishnets, fur jacket over nothing, combat boots caked in last night's grime.
- **Habits**: Drugs, sex, guns, repeat — until *SableFest*.
- **New Motto**: "*Numb don't mean dumb.*"

She reinvents herself as a **private shadow operator**. Not licensed. Not sane. Not particularly professional. But she's motivated — and she's got enough *dirt*, *sex appeal*, and *rage* to tear through the underground like a black-gloved tornado.

---

### **Setting**
- **City**: **Neon Bastion** — a fictional hyper-Florida hellscape; imagine Miami meets Los Angeles if the ocean boiled.
- **Tone**: Bright lights, wet streets, paranoia behind every nightclub door.
- **Vibe**:  
  - "Grand Theft Auto" levels of colorful scumbaggery.  
  - "Ready or Not" levels of **tactical panic** when shit *really* breaks off.  
  - No safehouses. No allies. Only escalating brutality.

---

### **Plot Arc**
- **Act 1: Baptism in Blood**  
  Mina scavenges the ruins of SableFest, steals evidence, and has to flee corrupt cops trying to wipe survivors.

- **Act 2: Honeytrap and Hammer**  
  She uses her looks and reputation to seduce her way up the ladder — low-level dealers, club owners, mid-tier enforcers — while blackmailing and black-bagging the ones who don't play nice.

- **Act 3: Glass House**  
  She finds out the cartel's political fronts — including the **Mayor of Neon Bastion** — greenlit a "soft kill" operation to *test* a new drug. SableFest was their beta.

- **Act 4: Ash and Ice**  
  She goes full terrorist.  
  Arsons. Kidnappings. Executions broadcast on burner accounts.  
  Her final target: the man who ordered the field test — a cartel-aligned biotech CEO, guarded like a dictator.

---

### **Themes**
- **Rage as Clarity**: Drugs numbed her. Vengeance makes her lucid.  
- **Paranoia**: Every helping hand hides a knife.  
- **Sexual Power**: Weaponized, not surrendered.  
- **Systemic Rot**: It’s not one bad apple — it’s a fucking orchard.

### **Key Visuals**
- Mina sliding out of a blood-smeared club in a torn mesh dress, neon behind her like a bad memory.
- Hooded figures in paramilitary gear gassing a hidden rave while black vans circle the perimeter.
- Drughouses burning while Mina speeds off on a stolen Ducati, laughing into the dawn.
