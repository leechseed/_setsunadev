ELIMINATE SEQUENCE 1 and see if it helps or hurts the pace of your script. You may\\\nfind that doing so cuts the fat and helps you to hit the ground running.\\\n2. COMPRESS SEQUENCES 1 THROUGH 4, changing them into two. Do you get to your\\\nmovie quicker? Some writers take too much time setting up and don’t realize that their\\\nmovies should have begun twenty minutes earlier.\\\n3. ADD MORE ACTIVITY TO SEQUENCES 5 AND 6. Cut the talk and up the activity.\\\nSentences that begin with “they discuss” or “they plan” are red flags that your Act 2B is\\\ntoo slow.\\\n4. CHANGE THE GOAL OF SEQUENCE 8. Take a hard look at that sequence. Did you\\\nspeed up your third act by simply writing Sequence 8 as a wrap up? Instead, look to it as a\\\n“final hurdle” and create a final physical or emotional goal that has to be accomplished.\\\nThat will give your third act the heft it needs.\"]],\"start1\":99,\"start2\":99,\"length1\":8,\"length2\":1022}]"
