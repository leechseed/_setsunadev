# FIND A FRESH TAKE — Scene Rewrite Exercise

Rewrite a stock scene by reimagining it through different angles. Use the prompts below to uncover a **fresh take** that transforms clichés into unique storytelling.

---

### **Stock Scene**
- **What is the stock scene you are starting with?**  
  (e.g., “a character walks into a bar,” “a hero confronts a villain,” etc.)

---

### **Fresh Take on Setting**
- **How can the environment or location subvert expectations?**  
  (e.g., instead of a bar, the confrontation happens in a daycare, a zero-gravity chamber, or a collapsing subway car.)

---

### **Fresh Take on Character**
- **How can the roles or traits of the characters make the scene new?**  
  (e.g., the “tough guy” is actually terrified of dogs; the “mentor” is drunk; the “villain” is polite and charming.)

---

### **Fresh Take on Dialogue**
- **How can speech patterns, tone, or word choice create freshness?**  
  (e.g., no words at all — just body language; characters argue in riddles; or the villain quotes children’s rhymes during a murder attempt.)
