## Core Principles
- **Hierarchy** â†’ One clear focal point, then secondary, tertiary reads.  
- **Balance** â†’ Symmetrical = calm, asymmetrical = dynamic.  
- **Contrast** â†’ Value contrast dominates; color, edge, detail support.  
- **Unity vs Variety** â†’ Cohesion plus controlled variation.  
- **Movement/Flow** â†’ Design the viewerâ€™s eye path.  
- **Emphasis** â†’ Make focal points intentional.  
- **Rhythm/Repetition** â†’ Patterns create cohesion.  
- **Depth** â†’ Foreground, middle, background planes.

## Grids & Ratio Systems

### Rule of Thirds
- Divide canvas into 3Ã—3 grid.  
- Place subjects on intersections or lines.  
- Quick, effective, but can become formulaic.

### Golden Ratio / Golden Rectangle / Spiral
- Proportions based on 1:1.618.  
- Align focal points with spiralâ€™s tight end.  
- Classical and natural but not magical.

### Golden Triangle
- Diagonal + perpendicular line.  
- Strong for action and diagonals.  

### Dynamic Symmetry
- Root rectangles (âˆš2, âˆš3, âˆš5).  
- Use diagonals/reciprocals to place figures.  
- Systematic but complex.

### Armature of the Rectangle
- Baroque (â†—) and Sinister (â†˜) diagonals.  
- Adds thrust and direction to the image.

### Grids of Fourths & Odds
- Quarters for precision.  
- Odd groupings feel natural.

---

## Balance & Arrangement Systems
- **Symmetry** â†’ Monumental, calm.  
- **Asymmetry** â†’ Dynamic, informal.  
- **Radial Balance** â†’ Mandalas, rose windows.  
- **Triangular/Pyramidal** â†’ Stable groupings.  
- **Rule of Odds** â†’ 3, 5, 7 objects read better.

---

## Eye-Guidance Techniques
- **Leading Lines** â†’ Roads, gazes, arms.  
- **Negative Space** â†’ Shapes subject clarity.  
- **Figureâ€“Ground** â†’ Clear separation.  
- **Gestalt Principles** â†’ Proximity, continuity, closure.  
- **Contrast Hierarchy** â†’ Value > edge > color > detail.  
- **Framing/Vignettes** â†’ Guide focus inward.

---

## Flow Patterns
- **S-curve / C-curve** â†’ Elegant flow.  
- **Z-pattern / F-pattern** â†’ Page & UX scanning.  
- **L-composition / Zig-zag** â†’ Structural anchors.  
- **Spiral Flow** â†’ Inward sweep.

---

## Depth & Spatial Strategies
- Fore/Mid/Back planes.  
- Overlap & occlusion.  
- Scale & perspective.  
- Atmospheric perspective.  
- Light as depth cue.

---

## Subject Placement & Cropping
- **Headroom/Noseroom** â†’ More space in facing direction.  
- **Horizon Control** â†’ Low = sky emphasis, high = ground.  
- **Edge Tension** â†’ Avoid kissing tangents.  
- **Centering** â†’ Use for iconic impact.

---

## Genre Playbooks
- **Landscape** â†’ Horizon thirds, foreground anchor.  
- **Portrait** â†’ Eyes on top third, catchlight.  
- **Still Life** â†’ Triangles, odd numbers.  
- **Architecture** â†’ Symmetry, rhythm.  
- **Street** â†’ Layers, value separation.  
- **Action** â†’ Diagonals, motion space.  
- **Film/Storyboards** â†’ Thirds, frames, horizon consistency.  
- **UI/UX** â†’ Z or F patterns, whitespace.

---

## Color & Weight
- Value contrast dominates.  
- Warm > Cool, Saturated > Desaturated.  
- Detailed > Plain, Sharp > Soft.  
- Faces/Text attract first.  
- 60/30/10 color dominance rule.

---

## Process
1. Define intent.  
2. Choose armature.  
3. Thumbnail variations.  
4. Reduce to notan (3 values).  
5. Place focal.  
6. Balance frame.  
7. Audit edges.  
8. Add depth.  
9. Flip & squint tests.  
10. Refine.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Myths
- Golden ratio â‰  magic.  
- Centering by default = weak.  
- No value hierarchy = mush.  
- Tangents/mergers flatten.  
- Horizon through heads.  
- Focal on edge = exit.

---

## Exercises
- 20 thumbnails/day.  
- 3-value notan studies.  
- Tangent hunts.  
- One-focal drills.  
- Flip test marathons.  
- Master value studies.  
- Negative-space exercises.

---

## Overlays & Setup
- **Photoshop:** Guides & templates.  
- **Procreate:** Drawing guides, spiral overlays.  
- **Cameras:** Grid overlays, highlight alert.  
- Keep overlay PNGs for quick use.

---

## Troubleshooting Checklist
- Can I see focal in 1 sec?  
- Does the eye exit frame?  
- Any tangents?  
- Is depth present?  
- Is background fighting?  
- Flip & squint test passed?

---

## Cheat Sheet Summary
- Pick one armature.  
- Build hierarchy.  
- Win with values.  
- Guide the eye inward.  
- Balance mass vs accent.  
- Control edges.  
- Protect borders.
