## Overview

This document defines the **Non-Negotiable Invariants** that enforce coherence across scale in *The Wave*.

This is not a historical warning about Nazism.
It is not a classroom ethics lesson.
It is a structural account of **how authoritarianism forms in real time among ordinary people**.

These invariants remain true across:
- casual student dialogue  
- classroom exercises  
- group rituals  
- escalating discipline  
- the final collapse  

They are **constraints on meaning**, not moral slogans.

---

## Project Scope

- **Medium**: Feature film  
- **Scale**: Line → Scene → Classroom → Social Group → Political Microcosm  
- **Domain Type**: Social / psychological / authoritarian  
- **Primary Risk**: Treating fascism as a historical anomaly instead of a behavioral pattern  

---

## Defined Non-Negotiable Invariants

### Invariant 1 — **Authoritarianism Begins as Order, Not Hate**

The initial appeal is structure, clarity, and belonging—not ideology.

---

### Invariant 2 — **Identity Forms Faster Than Belief**

People adopt roles and behaviors before fully accepting ideas.

---

### Invariant 3 — **Exclusion Is the First Real Act of Power**

The movement becomes real the moment someone is pushed out.

---

### Invariant 4 — **Control Escalates Faster Than Intent**

Authority systems outgrow their creators almost immediately.

---

## Invariant Validation Across Scale

### Invariant 1: Authoritarianism Begins as Order, Not Hate

- **Dialogue**  
  The movement is framed as discipline, unity, and focus.

- **Classroom Dynamics**  
  Rules improve performance and cohesion before ideology appears.

- **Emotional Hook**  
  Participants feel relief, not rage.

**Validation**: Fascism sells itself as efficiency.

---

### Invariant 2: Identity Forms Faster Than Belief

- **Visual Language**  
  Uniforms, posture, and symbols precede political commitment.

- **Behavioral Shift**  
  Students act “in character” before articulating beliefs.

- **Group Momentum**  
  Performance reinforces belief retroactively.

**Validation**: People become the role they play.

---

### Invariant 3: Exclusion Is the First Real Act of Power

- **Social Sorting**  
  Nonparticipants are mocked, isolated, or threatened.

- **Boundary Formation**  
  “Us” gains meaning only through “them.”

- **Escalation Point**  
  Authority crystallizes through punishment.

**Validation**: Power is proven by who gets erased.

---

### Invariant 4: Control Escalates Faster Than Intent

- **Teacher Role**  
  Leadership shifts from experimenter to authority figure.

- **System Momentum**  
  Enforcement continues even when doubts arise.

- **End State**  
  The system demands loyalty beyond reason.

**Validation**: Systems do not wait for consent.

---

## Scale Enforcement Matrix

| Scale | Enforcement Question | The Wave Result |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Line | Is unity framed as harmless? | Yes |
| Scene | Do rules precede ideology? | Yes |
| Classroom | Does identity outpace belief? | Yes |
| Group | Is power expressed via exclusion? | Yes |
| System | Does control exceed intent? | Yes |

---

## Failure Tests (What Dies)

The following are structurally disallowed:

- Fascism portrayed as purely hateful from the start  
- Participants depicted as stupid or evil  
- Ideology preceding social reinforcement  
- Leaders retaining control over the system  
- Easy disengagement without cost  

If any appear, *The Wave* becomes comforting instead of accurate.

---

## Operational Outcome

Because these invariants are enforced:

- The story feels uncomfortably plausible  
- The audience recognizes themselves in the process  
- Authority emerges from social mechanics, not villains  
- The collapse feels inevitable rather than shocking  
- The lesson lands without preaching  

---

## Summary

*The Wave* maintains coherence by enforcing ruthless constraints:

- order comes before hate  
- identity precedes belief  
- exclusion creates power  
- systems outrun intention  

The film works because **nothing about it requires monsters**.

**If authoritarianism required evil people, The Wave would be a lie.**
