## Purpose of Layer 0 Components

Layer 0 components enumerate **every axis along which reality can constrain narrative**.

They exist to:
- Eliminate hidden rule creation
- Prevent late-stage exceptions
- Make reality testable and auditable
- Anchor all higher layers in non-negotiable limits

If a constraint affects **existence, possibility, or irreversibility**, it belongs in Layer 0.

---

## What Counts as a Layer 0 Component

A component belongs to Layer 0 if it satisfies **all three** conditions:

1. It is true regardless of observers  
2. It applies before, during, and after the story  
3. It cannot be overridden by theme, character, or plot  

If a rule can be bent for drama, it is **not Layer 0**.

## Layer 0 Component Taxonomy

---

## 0.1 Existence & Ontology

**Concern:** What exists and what does not.

- **Entity Existence**
  - What kinds of entities can exist (material, abstract, informational)
- **Ontological Categories**
  - Distinction between physical, mental, symbolic, systemic
- **Boundary of Reality**
  - What is real vs illusory vs imagined
- **Continuity of Existence**
  - Whether entities persist when unobserved
- **Substrate Dependence**
  - Whether existence requires a medium (matter, energy, data)
- **Uniqueness vs Multiplicity**
  - Whether identical entities can coexist
- **Identity Persistence**
  - What makes something the “same thing” over time

---

## 0.2 Truth Structure

**Concern:** Whether truth exists independently of belief.

- **Objective Truth**
  - Facts that exist regardless of perception
- **Subjective Experience**
  - Perception without truth authority
- **Knowability**
  - Whether truth can be discovered
- **Completeness of Knowledge**
  - Whether total knowledge is possible
- **Error Tolerance**
  - Degree to which perception deviates from reality
- **Truth Latency**
  - Delay between fact and discovery
- **Truth Decay**
  - Whether truth degrades over time

---

## 0.3 Temporal Mechanics

**Concern:** How time operates.

- **Directionality**
  - Forward-only, bidirectional, cyclical
- **Continuity**
  - Continuous vs discrete time
- **Reversibility**
  - Whether past states can be restored
- **Temporal Persistence**
  - Whether effects outlast causes
- **Concurrency**
  - Whether events can occur simultaneously
- **Temporal Scope**
  - Local vs global time effects
- **Memory vs Time**
  - Relationship between recollection and actuality

---

## 0.4 Causality Mechanics

**Concern:** How effects arise.

- **Cause–Effect Requirement**
  - Whether every effect requires a cause
- **Proportionality**
  - Scale of cause relative to effect
- **Determinism**
  - Fixed outcomes vs branching possibilities
- **Delayed Consequence**
  - Time lag between cause and effect
- **Chain Persistence**
  - Whether causal chains can be broken
- **Causal Locality**
  - Whether causes must be adjacent
- **Causal Closure**
  - Whether outside forces can intervene

---

## 0.5 Probability & Uncertainty

**Concern:** Role of randomness.

- **Randomness Source**
  - True randomness vs apparent randomness
- **Risk Exposure**
  - How uncertainty increases consequence spread
- **Variance Bounds**
  - Limits on outcome deviation
- **Luck Influence**
  - Whether chance favors or is indifferent
- **Statistical Gravity**
  - Tendency toward average outcomes
- **Noise vs Signal**
  - Distinguishing randomness from pattern
- **Chance Constraints**
  - What chance can affect—and what it cannot

---

## 0.6 Scale Behavior

**Concern:** Whether rules change with magnitude.

- **Scale Invariance**
  - Same rules at all levels
- **Emergent Effects**
  - New behaviors without new rules
- **Amplification**
  - Small causes producing large effects
- **Aggregation**
  - Collective behavior vs individual behavior
- **Threshold Effects**
  - Points where behavior changes phase
- **Systemic Load**
  - Stress accumulation across scale
- **Nonlinearity**
  - Disproportionate outcomes without rule change

---

## 0.7 Permanence & Irreversibility

**Concern:** What cannot be undone.

- **Death Finality**
  - Whether death is reversible
- **Information Persistence**
  - Whether knowledge can be erased
- **Damage Permanence**
  - Whether harm can be fully repaired
- **State Locking**
  - Points of no return
- **Restoration Cost**
  - Price of partial reversal
- **Identity Loss**
  - Irrecoverable self-change
- **Historical Fixity**
  - Whether past events can be altered

---

## 0.8 Entropy, Decay & Maintenance

**Concern:** Long-term degradation.

- **Entropy Rate**
  - Speed of disorder increase
- **Maintenance Requirement**
  - Energy needed to sustain order
- **System Fatigue**
  - Wear through use
- **Collapse Threshold**
  - Point of failure
- **Stasis Cost**
  - Resources required to prevent decay
- **Renewal Limits**
  - Maximum possible restoration
- **Asymmetry of Breakdown**
  - Ease of destruction vs construction

---

## Component Interaction Rules

- Components **stack**, they do not replace each other  
- No component may contradict another  
- Higher-layer logic must obey all components simultaneously  
- Missing components default to **implicit assumptions** (dangerous)

---

## What Layer 0 Explicitly Excludes

Layer 0 does **not** include:
- Meaning or value judgments  
- Justice or fairness  
- Emotional truth  
- Narrative payoff  
- Character psychology  
- Audience expectation  

If it answers “why this matters,” it is **Layer 1+**, not Layer 0.

---

## Audit Checklist for Layer 0 Completeness

Use this to verify closure:

- Can reality function without characters?
- Are irreversible events truly irreversible?
- Does chance complicate but not resolve?
- Do small and large actions obey the same rules?
- Does decay require effort to prevent?

If any answer is “sometimes,” Layer 0 is underspecified.

---

## Final Lock

> **Layer 0 defines what is possible.  
Everything else defines what is meaningful within those limits.**

The next entry should formalize **Layer 1 — Value & Meaning Logic**, building directly on these constraints.
