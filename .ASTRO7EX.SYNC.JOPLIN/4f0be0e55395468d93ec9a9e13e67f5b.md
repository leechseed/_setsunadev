[Status](#status)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Overview\\\n\\\n**Claim Types define what kinds of truths this system is capable of proving.**  \\\nThey are not themes, morals, or messages.\\\n\\\nEach claim must be demonstrated through **repetition**, **consequence**, and **risk of falsification**.  \\\nIf a claim cannot survive contradiction, it is not structurally proven.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Claim Types\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 1. Constraint Claims  \\\n**What systems make impossible, regardless of intent.**\\\n\\\n- **Claim Form**: “Under these conditions, **no choice allows X to happen**.”\\\n- **Proof Method**: Repeated attempts fail for structural reasons, not personal flaws.\\\n- **Typical Evidence**: Enforcement persists; isolation holds; accumulation outpaces resistance.\\\n- **Disproof Risk**: A single clean escape invalidates the claim.\\\n- **Common Failure**: Blaming individuals instead of structures.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 2. Cost Claims  \\\n**What survival or action permanently costs.**\\\n\\\n- **Claim Form**: “To achieve or endure X, Y is lost forever.”\\\n- **Proof Method**: Irreversible residue compounds across arcs.\\\n- **Typical Evidence**: Relationships degrade; identities narrow; options close.\\\n- **Disproof Risk**: Restoration, forgiveness-as-reset, costless victory.\\\n- **Common Failure**: Treating suffering as seasoning instead of structural loss.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3. Power Claims  \\\n**How power behaves when challenged.**\\\n\\\n- **Claim Form**: “When confronted, power does Z.”\\\n- **Proof Method**: Resistance consistently triggers predictable responses.\\\n- **Typical Evidence**: Outsourcing; isolation; enforcement without legitimacy.\\\n- **Disproof Risk**: Exposure alone halting enforcement.\\\n- **Common Failure**: Treating power as a moral actor instead of a mechanism.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4. Legibility Claims  \\\n**What the system can and cannot recognize.**\\\n\\\n- **Claim Form**: “Only X is visible, rewarded, or punished.”\\\n- **Proof Method**: Repeated invisibility of sincere but illegible acts.\\\n- **Typical Evidence**: Inputs matter; beliefs do not. Pain is ignored.\\\n- **Disproof Risk**: Internal states producing outcomes directly.\\\n- **Common Failure**: Smuggling justice through recognition.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5. Agency Claims  \\\n**What choice can and cannot accomplish.**\\\n\\\n- **Claim Form**: “Choice affects outcomes **without altering constraints**.”\\\n- **Proof Method**: Outcomes follow choices, but rules remain unchanged.\\\n- **Typical Evidence**: Different choices yield different costs, not different systems.\\\n- **Disproof Risk**: Exceptional choices bypassing constraint.\\\n- **Common Failure**: Confusing agency with freedom.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 6. Persistence Claims  \\\n**What survives over time.**\\\n\\\n- **Claim Form**: “Left unattended, X grows, decays, or dominates.”\\\n- **Proof Method**: Accumulation outpaces opposition across acts.\\\n- **Typical Evidence**: Power consolidates; integrity erodes without upkeep.\\\n- **Disproof Risk**: Stability without maintenance.\\\n- **Common Failure**: Treating time as neutral.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 7. Meaning Claims  \\\n**Where meaning exists—and where it does not.**\\\n\\\n- **Claim Form**: “Meaning can exist without effect.”\\\n- **Proof Method**: Characters retain dignity without altering outcomes.\\\n- **Typical Evidence**: Layer 3 expressions persist under isolation.\\\n- **Disproof Risk**: Meaning producing leverage, immunity, or altered enforcement **by default**.\\\n- **Common Failure**: Letting inner resolution equal external change.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 8. Collapse Claims  \\\n**How and where systems fail.**\\\n\\\n- **Claim Form**: “Systems fail only when X occurs.”\\\n- **Proof Method**: Near-failures accumulate but do not break the system until a specific condition fails.\\\n- **Typical Evidence**: Leakage; overload; contradiction; unsustainable maintenance.\\\n- **Disproof Risk**: Arbitrary collapse or villain defeat.\\\n- **Common Failure**: Treating collapse as catharsis instead of consequence **and condition**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Usage Rules\\\n\\\n- A story may prove **multiple claim types**, but must prioritize **one dominant claim**.\\\n- Claims must be **risked repeatedly**; counterexamples are required.\\\n- Proof occurs through **structure**, not dialogue or declaration.\\\n- Claims must remain valid even if the protagonist fails.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Integrity Check\\\n\\\n- Can the claim be stated in one sentence without moral language?\\\n- Does the story attempt to disprove it before proving it?\\\n- Would the claim still hold if the protagonist died or was wrong?\\\n\\\nIf any answer is **NO**, the claim is not structurally proven.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Status\\\n\\\n**Canonical Claim Type Set — Locked**  \\\nAll Layer 5 arguments must map to one or more claim types above.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5113}]"
