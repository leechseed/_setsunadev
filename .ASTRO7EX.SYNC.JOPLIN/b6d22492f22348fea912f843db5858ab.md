## Sensory Awareness Markers
Use the following scales in your notes:
- **Flex Sensation (1–10)** – how deep the stretch feels
- **Erotic Charge (1–10)** – how sensual the movement feels
- **Breath Flow (1–10)** – how well you’re breathing under strain

## Final Reminder
Mobility is not just for injury prevention — it’s for **display, control, and surrender**.

Each centimeter of opening is a centimeter closer to total erotic presence.

**Stretch slow. Breathe deep. Open completely.**
