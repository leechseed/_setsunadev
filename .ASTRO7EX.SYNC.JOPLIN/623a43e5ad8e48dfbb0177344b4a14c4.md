As the thematic antithesis to *Sense of Self*, *State of Being* surfaces in the *relational space* between **Vivian** and the **MODS**—less about who they think they are, and more about what they *actually are* beneath roles, protocols, and perceptions.\\\n\\\nWhere *Sense of Self* explores identity as self-perception and projection, *State of Being* interrogates the raw, unchangeable *nature* of those involved. The tension arises not in *who they appear to be*—but *what they truly are,* stripped of narrative, stripped of myth.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📖 Definition – State of Being\\\n\\\n* **State of Being**: One’s true nature—the unfiltered, existential condition of existence.\\\n* **Dynamic Pair**: *Sense of Self* — One’s perceived identity; the mask, the persona, the role.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧱 Structural Theory – The Role of the M/I Counterpoint\\\n\\\nIn Dramatica, the **M/I Story Counterpoint** is not just the “opposite” of the Issue, but its **hidden critique**. It is where the audience is given a chance to contrast **appearance vs. essence**.\\\n\\\n* *Sense of Self* is **fragile, narrative-driven, and shaped by others.**\\\n* *State of Being* is **brutal, stable, and uncaring.**\\\n\\\nWhile the story focuses on identity as an experience, *State of Being* reminds us: **There is something underneath that will never change.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🌑 ASTRO7EX Expression – State of Being in Vivian vs. MODS\\\n\\\nIn ASTRO7EX, the *State of Being* counterpoint is explored in quiet, brutal moments—*where performance stops, and truth bleeds through*.\\\n\\\n### Expression in Vivian:\\\n\\\n* Beneath her identity (soldier, thief, prophet), she is a **child soldier, conditioned to kill, built to survive.**\\\n* Her “self” may evolve, but her *being*—what she is capable of—remains terrifyingly constant.\\\n* In vulnerable scenes, she recognizes: “I was made for war.”\\\n\\\n### Expression in MODS:\\\n\\\n* They don’t *become* anything.\\\n* Their *State of Being* is recursive, encoded, static.\\\n* They embody **existence without narrative.**\\\n* No history. No self. Only *what they are*: a protocol that endures.\\\n\\\nWhen they speak, it is not character—it is **condition**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 👥 Character-by-Character Breakdown\\\n\\\n### **Vivian (Main Character)**\\\n\\\n* Feels her identity is something she can reclaim, control, or shape.\\\n* But her *State of Being*—the trauma, the reflexes, the instincts—remains.\\\n* The MODS confront her with what she *can’t change*, even as she tries.\\\n\\\n### **MODS (Impact Characters)**\\\n\\\n* Have no identity crisis because they never pretended to be anything else.\\\n* Their *State of Being* is **their function**.\\\n* This constancy is not moral—it is horrifying.\\\n* Their refusal to change reveals Vivian’s own inability to *escape her nature*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🔍 Thematic Analysis – Literary & Mythic Lenses\\\n\\\n### 🧠 Harold Bloom – *The Burden of Inheritance*\\\n\\\n* Vivian’s *State of Being* is overdetermined: born of violence, trained by the system.\\\n* Like Bloom’s tragic heroes, she tries to author her life—but is defined by a force older than her will.\\\n\\\n### 🛡 Joseph Campbell – *The Shadow Self*\\\n\\\n* The MODS are the *shadow* of Vivian: not her enemy, but her **undeniable essence**.\\\n* In myth, the final trial is not to defeat the dragon—but to admit that the dragon lives inside you.\\\n\\\n### 🛰 Early 2000s Sci-Fi Anime\\\n\\\n* *Texhnolyze*, *Ergo Proxy*, *Boogiepop Phantom*: Characters often transcend or *succumb* to their State of Being.\\\n* Vivian is not the *protagonist who finds herself*, but the one who **fears what she already knows**.\\\n\\\n### 🎭 Robert McKee – *Being vs. Doing*\\\n\\\n* Every choice Vivian makes stems not from what she wants—but from **what she is**.\\\n* The MODS push her not through action, but through *ontology*: they make her confront **herself**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📊 Spectrum Placement – Authorial Value Judgment\\\n\\\n> **Where does ASTRO7EX fall on the State of Being spectrum?**\\\n\\\n**Position:** 8 out of 11 (Right-leaning: *Moderately Disadvantageous*)\\\n\\\n**Interpretation**:\\\n\\\n* The story presents *State of Being* as **something unavoidable**, but not noble.\\\n* Its constancy is oppressive, not liberating.\\\n* In ASTRO7EX, to live according to one’s true nature is to risk becoming a **mechanism** instead of a soul.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧩 Summary – How State of Being Functions in ASTRO7EX\\\n\\\n*State of Being* defines the **tragic underside** of the Vivian-MODS relationship. Where *Sense of Self* is fluid and aspirational, *State of Being* is static and cruel. It strips away the comfort of reinvention and exposes the truth beneath performance: some things do not change, no matter how much we scream.\\\n\\\nIn this narrative:\\\n\\\n* The MODS confront Vivian not with antagonism—but with **inevitability**.\\\n* Vivian’s defiance is not in becoming someone new—but in **refusing to believe that who she is now is all she ever was.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✅ Status\\\n\\\n**Main vs. Impact Story Counterpoint: Complete.**\\\nTheme: **State of Being**\\\nAuthor Bias: **Moderately Disadvantageous**\\\nReady to proceed to: **Main vs. Impact Story Thematic Conflict — Sense of Self vs. State of Being.**\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6094}]"
