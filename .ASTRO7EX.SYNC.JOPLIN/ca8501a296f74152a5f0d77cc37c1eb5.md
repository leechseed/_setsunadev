[Summary](#summary)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Overview**\\\nThe ARC Raiders skill tree is the **core permanent progression system** in the game.  \\\nYour build determines:\\\n- How you move  \\\n- How you survive  \\\n- How you breach  \\\n- How you interact with ARC  \\\n- How effectively you raid long-term  \\\n\\\nBecause the level cap is **75**, you cannot max all three trees. This makes **build identity** a critical gameplay choice.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Mental Model Framework**\\\nTo understand the skill tree, we use:\\\n\\\n## **“You are what you build up to be.”**\\\n\\\nAnd operationally through PSTO:\\\n\\\n- **Policy:** What type of raider you fundamentally want to be  \\\n- **Strategy:** Which tree(s) you commit to  \\\n- **Tactics:** How you distribute your limited skill points  \\\n- **Operations:** What you actually unlock first, next, and last  \\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Skill Trees in ARC Raiders**\\\nThere are three primary trees (names simplified for clarity):\\\n\\\n1. **Mobility** – stamina, movement, traversal  \\\n2. **Survival** – utility, disarming, breaching, resistances  \\\n3. **Combat / Utility** – effectiveness inside fights and raids  \\\n\\\nKey mechanics:\\\n- Level cap: **75**  \\\n- High-tier nodes require **15 points invested** in that tree  \\\n- You cannot master all three trees  \\\n- Early universal skills are always valuable  \\\n- Expeditions may add up to **5 bonus skill points**\\\n\\\nBecause of these constraints, **build identity is mandatory, not optional.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **PSTO Breakdown**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Policy**  \\\n**“Pick the kind of raider you want to be.”**\\\n\\\nYour build is your *identity*.  \\\nYou cannot do everything. You cannot max every tree.  \\\nThe level cap enforces:\\\n- A focused specialist (deep in one tree)  \\\n- A hybrid (two partial trees)  \\\n- A generalist (all three lightly touched)  \\\n\\\n**Policy determines your long-term purpose.**  \\\nExamples:\\\n- “I want to be the stealth/mobility runner.”  \\\n- “I want to be the trap-disarming utility operator.”  \\\n- “I want to be a universal problem solver.”  \\\n\\\nIf you don’t define this early, your build becomes accidental and weaker.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Strategy**  \\\n**“Choose how many trees you commit to.”**\\\n\\\nGiven limited points:\\\n- **One-tree specialization** → strongest identity, strongest late-game perks  \\\n- **Two-tree hybrid** → flexible, strong mid-game, weaker capstone access  \\\n- **Three-tree generalist** → universal early perks, no mastery  \\\n\\\nStrategic questions:\\\n- Do I need top-tier perks (the 15/36-point unlocks)?  \\\n- Do I want universal usefulness, or specialized power?  \\\n- Which tree gives me the most leverage for my raid style?  \\\n\\\nYour **strategy determines point allocation across trees.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Tactics**  \\\n**“Use your early points to unlock universal efficiency, then pivot.”**\\\n\\\nTactical principles:\\\n- Buy **universal early skills** first (Field Crafting, stamina, breaching speed)  \\\n- Use **minimum prerequisite points** to reach the perk you actually want  \\\n- Avoid spreading early points across too many trees  \\\n- Build a **power spike curve**:\\\n  - Early = universal  \\\n  - Mid = specialization  \\\n  - Late = mastery or hybridization  \\\n\\\nYour tactics determine *how* you progress through the trees.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## **Operations**  \\\n**“What to actually do with your skill points right now.”**\\\n\\\nConcrete actionable behaviors:\\\n- Unlock **Field Crafting** as soon as possible  \\\n- Buy **increased stamina** early in Mobility  \\\n- Buy **breaching speed** early in Survival  \\\n- Once universal skills are secured →  \\\n  **begin piling points into the one tree you commit to mastering**\\\n- Only buy cross-tree nodes when:\\\n  - You need a specific mid-tree perk  \\\n  - Your build concept requires it  \\\n  - You want hybrid flexibility over mastery  \\\n\\\nOperations = your moment-to-moment leveling decisions.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Build Archetypes**\\\n\\\n### **1. Specialist (Deep Build)**\\\n- Maxes one tree  \\\n- Strongest endgame perk identity  \\\n- Weakest flexibility  \\\n- Best for players who know exactly what they want\\\n\\\n### **2. Hybrid (Balanced Build)**\\\n- Two partial trees  \\\n- Strong mid-tier functionality  \\\n- Good for solo players  \\\n- Solid early/mid-game progression, softer late-game specialization\\\n\\\n### **3. Generalist (Jack of All Trades)**\\\n- Light spread across all trees  \\\n- Great universal utility  \\\n- No high-tier abilities  \\\n- Best for exploration-heavy, low-conflict players\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Universal Early Skill Priorities**\\\nRegardless of build:\\\n\\\n1. **Field Crafting**  \\\n2. **Stamina Upgrades**  \\\n3. **Breaching Speed**  \\\n4. Any perk that accelerates:\\\n   - Resource conservation  \\\n   - Movement  \\\n   - Breaching or looting speed  \\\n   - Survivability  \\\n\\\nThese are universally valuable because they impact **every raid**, regardless of your build identity.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Summary**\\\nThe ARC Raiders skill tree is the most important long-term progression system in the game due to:\\\n- The level cap  \\\n- The 15-point unlock thresholds  \\\n- Universal vs. specialized skill interactions  \\\n\\\nUsing PSTO gives you a clear way to think about your build:\\\n- **Policy:** Choose your raider archetype  \\\n- **Strategy:** Decide specialization vs. hybrid vs. generalist  \\\n- **Tactics:** Use early points to unlock universal perks, then commit  \\\n- **Operations:** Execute upgrades that support your chosen identity  \\\n\\\n**You truly are what you build up to be.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5921}]"
