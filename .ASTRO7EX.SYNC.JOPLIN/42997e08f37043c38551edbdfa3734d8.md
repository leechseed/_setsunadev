Status\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 1. 🔍 Summary\\\n\\\n**Vivian’s story concludes by observing, reacting to, and ultimately accepting how things are changing—not just in the world, but within herself.** No longer burdened with resisting change or predicting outcomes, she watches as the shift she feared becomes unavoidable. Her arc transitions from an *attempt to control the narrative* to a *witnessing of the unraveling and reintegration* of her identity, beliefs, and environment. MC Signpost 4 locks her into a state of heightened awareness where meaning emerges not through action, but through perception.\\\n\\\nThe climax of her journey is *not in a single choice*—but in her recognition that change is the only constant left uncorrupted.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 2. 🎯 Dramatica Theory Alignment\\\n\\\n### **MC Signpost 4** — *How Things Are Changing*\\\n\\\n* **Thematic Domain**: Situation / Universe (Linear change over time)\\\n* **Narrative Function**: Final perspective shift before narrative resolution.\\\n* **Dynamic Pair**: *The Future* ↔ *How Things Are Changing*\\\n* **Character Growth**: From *denial or resistance* to *acknowledgment and integration*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 3. 🧠 Internal Transformation in Final Act\\\n\\\n| Change Vector            | Expression at Climax                                                                                        |\\\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\n| **Self-Concept**         | Vivian stops seeing herself as broken. She recognizes that evolution itself was her defense.                |\\\n| **Perception of Others** | Her fallen teammates are no longer “victims of a plan”—they’re now seen as corrupted echoes in flux.        |\\\n| **Agency**               | She chooses to bear witness instead of seeking control, fulfilling her narrative as a *steadfast observer*. |\\\n| **Emotion**              | Grief gives way to bittersweet clarity.
