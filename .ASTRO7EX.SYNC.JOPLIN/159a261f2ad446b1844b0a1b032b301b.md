## Shaving Protocol (Per Zone)
1. **Cleanse first** – remove sweat, oil, residue
2. **Exfoliate gently** – dry brush or pre-shave scrub
3. **Apply lather/gel** – thick, protective layer
4. **Use sharp blade** – single pass with grain first, against only if safe
5. **Rinse cold** – close pores
6. **Moisturize or oil** – aloe, shea butter, or vitamin E oil

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Shaving dry or without lubricant
- Using dull razors more than twice
- Exfoliating broken or irritated skin
- Skipping post-shave moisture
- Neglecting hydration and diet (internal skin support)

---

## Aftercare Products (Recommended)
- **Aloe vera gel** (cooling)
- **Shea butter lotion** (deep hydration)
- **Vitamin C serum** (fade marks)
- **BHA body spray** (for butt/inner thigh bumps)

---

## Final Reminder
Smooth skin isn’t luck — it’s **ritualized labor**.  
Every swipe of the razor is an act of presentation.

**Strip it. Expose it. Keep it soft.**
