## Purpose of Scaling in Narrative Design

Scaling defines **how narrative meaning expands without mutating**.

It exists to prevent:
- Thematic drift  
- Power inflation  
- Character exceptionalism  
- Structural incoherence  

Scaling ensures that **the same rules remain true**, while their **consequence radius increases**.

---

## What “Scaling” Actually Means

Scaling is **not**:
- Adding lore  
- Raising stakes arbitrarily  
- Making things “bigger”  
- Introducing new rules  

Scaling **is**:
- Increasing consequence scope  
- Activating deeper constraints  
- Allowing effects to propagate farther and longer  

> Scaling widens impact; it does not change logic.

---

## The Narrative Scale Ladder

Canonical progression:

> **Sentence → Beat → Scene → Episode → Arc → Season → World**

Each rung:
- Contains all lower rungs  
- Introduces broader consequence  
- Activates more persistent effects  

---

## Responsibilities at Each Scale

### 1. **Sentence**
**Unit of pressure**

Responsible for:
- Intent
- Implication
- Micro power shifts
- Tone consistency

Must ensure:
- Every line *does something*

Must not:
- Explain the world
- State theme
- Resolve conflict

---

### 2. **Beat**
**Unit of change**

Responsible for:
- Micro cause → effect
- Decision or realization
- Momentum

Must ensure:
- A before/after difference

Must not:
- Reset emotional state
- Stall motion

---

### 3. **Scene**
**Unit of conflict**

Responsible for:
- Opposing goals
- Escalation
- Cost

Must ensure:
- Someone loses something
- Resistance is present

Must not:
- Introduce new world rules
- End cleanly for all parties

---

### 4. **Episode**
**Unit of inquiry**

Responsible for:
- Testing a belief or assumption
- Revealing behavioral patterns
- Consequence propagation

Must ensure:
- A question is pressured, not solved

Must not:
- Restore the status quo
- Deliver final answers

---

### 5. **Arc**
**Unit of transformation**

Responsible for:
- Irreversible change
- Closed-off options
- Compounded consequence

Must ensure:
- Characters or systems are no longer the same

Must not:
- Allow cost-free growth
- Undo prior damage

---

### 6. **Season**
**Unit of argument**

Responsible for:
- Making a claim about how the world works
- Stress-testing that claim
- Clarifying cost or failure

Must ensure:
- A coherent thematic stance emerges

Must not:
- Introduce new moral physics
- Contradict prior invariants

---

### 7. **World**
**Unit of permanence**

Responsible for:
- History
- Systems
- Rule enforcement beyond characters

Must ensure:
- The world functions without protagonists

Must not:
- Bend rules for favorites
- Retcon consequences

---

## What Scaling Does *Not* Do

Scaling must never:
- Introduce exceptions  
- Rewrite causality  
- Change moral logic  
- Override systemic power  

If scaling requires new rules, the foundation is broken.

---

## Common Scaling Failures

- **Lore dump at scene scale** → world logic introduced too early  
- **Theme stated in dialogue** → season logic forced into sentence  
- **Reset episodes** → arc consequences avoided  
- **Hero fixes the system** → world scale violated  

Most “writing problems” are actually **scale violations**.

---

## Scaling Diagnostic Questions

Use these to debug fast:

- What changed at this scale that could not change at a lower one?
- Did consequence radius increase?
- Did any rule appear that was not already enforced below?
- Is this moment too small or too large for its scale?

If it feels “off,” it’s almost always a scale mismatch.

---

## Relationship to Invariants (Preview)

Scaling does **not** create invariants.  
It **activates** them across wider territory.

- Invariants define *what is always true*  
- Scaling defines *how far the truth reaches*  

The next knowledgebase entry will formalize how **scaling interacts with narrative layers and invariants**.
