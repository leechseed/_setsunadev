## 1. **Overview**

This document standardizes the **Erotic Anatomy Attribute Library** for character design across visual media (film, anime, games) and textual media (novels, scripts).
Each attribute bank provides **6–8 curated options**, with a **strict x:1 selection rule** to ensure clarity, consistency, and strong sexual identity for each character.

---

## 2. **Purpose**

* Define a **uniform erotic design language** across all characters.
* Provide artists, writers, and directors with **quick-select sexual and aesthetic parameters**.
* Reinforce the PSTO system by making sex appeal **functional, intentional, and narratively justified**, not incidental.

---

## 3. **PSTO Framework Integration**

### **P — Policy**

High-level sexual function: what instinct the character triggers and why.

### **S — Strategy**

Aesthetic direction: silhouette logic, design geometry, erotic identity language.

### **T — Tactics**

Physical breakdown: body attributes, facial construction, movement systems, fetish structures.

### **O — Operations**

Deployment: cinematography usage, scene patterns, goon-fuel timing, body-in-motion execution.

The Attribute Library lives primarily under **Tactics**, but supports **Policy, Strategy, and Operations** with consistent erotic vocabulary.
