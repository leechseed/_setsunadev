It argues that command and control is fundamentally a human and cognitive endeavor, not a technical or procedural one. The publication defines command and control as the exercise of authority and direction through leadership, decisionmaking, and communication, explains its relationship to tempo and initiative, and emphasizes decentralization guided by commander’s intent. It demands judgment, trust, shared understanding, and disciplined initiative to function effectively in war.\\\n\\\n## TL;DR\\\n- Command and control exists to enable coordinated action under uncertainty.\\\n- Command and control is primarily a human activity, not a technical system.\\\n- Centralized decisionmaking and decentralized execution are essential.\\\n- Commander’s intent provides unity of effort amid chaos.\\\n- Information supports command but does not replace judgment.\\\n- Tempo is generated through effective command and control.\\\n- Friction and uncertainty cannot be eliminated, only managed.\\\n- Trust and shared understanding are prerequisites for decentralization.\\\n- Technology must support, not dominate, command and control.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Table of Contents\\\n1.

**Therefore:** Command and control must manage, not eliminate, uncertainty.\\\n- **Claim 2:** Human judgment is central to decisionmaking.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Command and control is fundamentally a human activity.\\\n- **Claim 3:** Excessive control suppresses initiative.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Decentralization guided by intent is required.\\\n- **Claim 4:** Information and technology are imperfect.\\\n  - **Therefore:** They must support, not replace, leadership.\\\n- **Conclusion:** Effective command and control enables coordinated action by combining intent, judgment, trust, and adaptation.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Key Concepts & Definitions\\\n- **Command**: Authority and responsibility to direct forces.\\\n- **Control**: Regulation of forces and activities to achieve purpose.\\\n- **Command and Control**: Exercise of authority and direction through leadership and communication.\\\n- **Commander’s Intent**: Expression of purpose and desired end state.\\\n- **Decentralization**: Delegation of decisionmaking authority.\\\n- **Judgment**: Ability to decide under uncertainty.\\\n- **Initiative**: Acting to seize and exploit opportunity.\\\n- **Tempo**: Speed and rhythm of action.\\\n- **Friction**: Resistance to action inherent in war.\\\n- **Uncertainty**: Lack of complete information.\\\n- **Feedback**: Information used to adjust actions.\\\n- **Communication**: Transmission of intent and guidance.\\\n- **Technology**: Tools supporting command and control.\\\n- **Trust**: Confidence enabling delegation and initiative.\\\n- **Authority**: Lawful power to command.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":8412}]"
