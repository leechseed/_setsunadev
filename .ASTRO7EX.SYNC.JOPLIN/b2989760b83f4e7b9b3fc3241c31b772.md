body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# Manifesto – Entertainment-First Narrative Design\\\n## SECTION: Narrative Doctrine  \\\n## TITLE: The Primacy of Entertainment\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Entertainment-First Design**\\\n\\\n**Definition**  \\\nEntertainment-First Design is a narrative philosophy that asserts: **the primary function of storytelling is to entertain.** All other objectives—whether realism, political alignment, representation, or technical craft—are subordinate. A story that fails to engage emotionally or viscerally has already failed, regardless of its intellectual merit.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Core Tenets**\\\n\\\n1. **Engagement Before Message**  \\\n   - A scene must *entertain first*, or it should be cut.  \\\n   - Audience attention is the most valuable currency.\\\n\\\n2. **Emotional Logic Over Realism**  \\\n   - Events follow the rhythm of *feeling*, not “accuracy.”  \\\n   - Fiction is not beholden to the rules of reality—it is beholden to resonance.\\\n\\\n3. **Momentum Is Sacred**  \\\n   - Narrative flow must never be stalled for exposition or ideological detours.  \\\n   - The plot should escalate consistently; *drag is death*.\\\n\\\n4. **Stylization Is Power**  \\\n   - Embrace the mythic, the operatic, the absurd.  \\\n   - Style should **amplify** content, not water it down for realism’s sake.\\\n\\\n5. **Character as Catalyst**  \\\n   - Characters are **emotional weapons**—not walking thinkpieces.  \\\n   - Archetype > accuracy. Desire > duty. Conflict > correctness.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Modern Narrative Pathologies**\\\n\\\n1. **Realism Fetishism**  \\\n   - Grit for grit’s sake dilutes joy.  \\\n   - “Grounded” often means *boring*.  \\\n   - Realism is not a virtue—it's a constraint.\\\n\\\n2. **Moral Didacticism**  \\\n   - Stories have become vessels for sermons.  \\\n   - Preaching kills pacing. Virtue kills drama.  \\\n   - *Thematic subtext* > *ideological monologue*.\\\n\\\n3. **Fear-Based Writing**  \\\n   - Creativity withers under the gaze of cancellation culture.  \\\n   - Fear of offense leads to bland characters, sanitized conflicts, neutered stakes.\\\n\\\n4. **Representation Tokenism**  \\\n   - “Diversity” is often performative—serving optics, not narrative.  \\\n   - True representation arises from specificity, not obligation.\\\n\\\n5. **Subversion Fatigue**  \\\n   - Constantly “flipping the script” alienates the audience.  \\\n   - A well-earned trope is more satisfying than a forced reversal.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Why This Kills Stories**\\\n\\\n- **Escapism Vanishes**  \\\n  Fiction becomes indistinguishable from social studies.  \\\n  The screen becomes a mirror when it should be a window.\\\n\\\n- **The Archetype Is Abandoned**  \\\n  When we discard the mythic for the mundane, resonance fades.  \\\n  Stories become trivial—unable to echo across time.\\\n\\\n- **Audience Alienation**  \\\n  People come to *feel*, not be taught.  \\\n  If your story isn’t built for them, it won’t reach them.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Entertainment as Ethos**\\\n\\\n**Entertainment is not compromise.**  \\\nIt is not the enemy of substance.  \\\nIt is the only delivery system that works.  \\\nAll theme, message, commentary—must ride on the back of entertainment.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Exemplars of the Ethos**\\\n\\\n- *Mad Max: Fury Road* – Narrative by motion, not monologue.  \\\n- *Kill Bill* – Operatic ultraviolence with primal stakes.  \\\n- *John Wick* – Worldbuilding through tone, not exposition.  \\\n- *The Matrix* – Philosophy and kung fu, not one or the other.  \\\n- *Everything Everywhere All At Once* – Maximalist emotion wrapped in absurdism.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Final Dictum**\\\n\\\n> **A bored audience is a dead audience.**  \\\n> There is no moral, political, or intellectual goal in narrative that justifies being boring.  \\\n> To entertain is to honor your audience. To entertain is to serve the soul.  \\\n> **Entertainment is the beginning of belief.**\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3645}]"
