## Overview

Shortlist of chapters/warbands you actually care about for **Space Marine 2** RP:

- Each entry = **Lore Vibe** + **Pick for RP if…**
- No mechanical differences, just **archetype and flavor**.

---

## Loyalist First Founding Chapters

### Dark Angels

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Secretive monk-knights with a gigantic shame kink about past heresy. Hooded robes, gothic cathedral aesthetic, permanent redacted files.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You like **“Catholic guilt: the faction.”** Crusading knights hunting their own fallen brothers, brooding, and hiding classified sins from everyone.

---

### Salamanders

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Fire-loving, hammer-wielding blacksmith-philosophers; unusually compassionate toward humans compared to other Astartes.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You like **“gentle giant who turns people into ash with a flamer.”** Protector of civilians, artisan, charismatic big brother energy.

---

### Black Templars

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Zealous crusader-paladins permanently on holy war. Zero psykers, max religious fervor, everything is a crusade.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You want to be an **unhinged paladin** – chanting litanies, hating witches, never taking off your armor, and always, always charging.

---

## “Weirdos & Orphans” Loyalists

### Blood Ravens

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Knowledge-obsessed mystery collectors with suspiciously good luck around relics (Dawn of War fame). “We didn’t steal it, we found it.”
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You want to play a **librarian-leaning relic hoarder** – always “finding” sacred artifacts, half-suspected of being secretly cursed.

---

### Carcharodons (Space Sharks)

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Semi-mythical void predators; brutal, silent, tribal. They show up from the dark, butcher everything, then vanish back into the deep.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You want **shark horror energy** – quiet, distant, super-violent, treating campaigns as migratory hunts.

---

### Red Scorpions

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Gene-purity fanatics, snobby, obsessed with regulations and “true” Astartes standards.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You like **rules-lawyer space marines** – constantly judging other chapters, sneering at anyone not up to your standards.

---

### Storm Giants

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Massive, slow, durable marines; patient, methodical, rarely speak. Walking fortresses.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You want to be a **living fortress** – towering, quiet, and terrifying when you finally move.

---

## Ultramarine Successors

### Doom Eagles

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Death-obsessed paratrooper types; convinced they’re already dead, so they fear nothing.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You want **emo stoic jump troops** – fatalistic, fearless, grim but oddly calm while dropping out of the sky into hell.

---

### Tome Keepers

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Archivist-warriors, dedicated to preserving history and stories of the Imperium.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You want a **combat historian** – the squad scribe who records every battle obsessively and quotes past campaigns like scripture.

---

### Hawk Lords

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Aero-assault junkies; jump packs, fast drops, loud colors (purple flex), and high-speed strikes.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You want **high-style aerial murder** – screaming in from the skies in flashy colors, living for momentum and spectacle.

---

## Chaos Warbands

### Black Legion

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Abaddon’s main legion; ex-Luna Wolves/Sons of Horus. Generic, central Chaos poster boys of the Long War.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You want to be the **face of Chaos** – ambitious warlord type, framing every action as part of a grand crusade against the Imperium.

---

### Death Guard

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Plague-marines of Nurgle; unstoppable rot, obscene resilience, and surprisingly chill gallows humor.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You like **body horror + weirdly chill camaraderie** – talking about decay like it’s just weather, shrugging off mutilation with a laugh.

---

### Night Lords

- **Lore Vibe:**  
  Terror troops; Batman if Batman skinned people and worshipped fear instead of justice. No real ideology beyond punishment and dread.
- **Pick for RP if:**  
  You enjoy **psychological horror** – intimidation, threats over ideology, “we broke them before we shot them.”
