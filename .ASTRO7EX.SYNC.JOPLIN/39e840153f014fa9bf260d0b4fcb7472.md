These mantras reinforce your transformation, edging discipline, and denial obedience.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Daily Recitation (Before Edging or Yoga)\\\n**Say aloud or write 3x daily:**\\\n> “I do not seek pleasure. I earn it. My orgasm is not mine. It belongs to my obedience.”\\\n\\\n> “I submit to the system. I complete every segment. I edge, I ache, I obey.”\\\n\\\n> “Every breath deepens my discipline. Every denial sharpens my purpose. I am becoming beautiful through restraint.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Mirror Submission (Optional – Once Weekly)\\\nStand fully nude before mirror. Repeat the following 5 times while maintaining eye contact:\\\n> “Look at what you are. Look at what you’re becoming. You are not free. You are owned by the ritual.”\\\n\\\nThen kneel and say:\\\n> “I give my body to the process. I give my pleasure to the protocol. I give my ego to the edge.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Orgasm Permission Ritual (Only When Allowed)\\\nWhen orgasm is earned and approved:\\\n1. Kneel.\\\n2. Whisper:\\\n> “Thank you, discipline. I’ve obeyed. May I be permitted release?”\\\n\\\n3. Touch only after speaking:\\\n> “This is not reward. This is ritual. I will cum with purpose.”\\\n\\\n4. Post-release, remain still, silent, and reflective for 2–3 minutes.\\\n5. Log immediately in `cum_authorization_log.md`.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Affirmation Variants (Use As Needed)\\\n| Theme | Phrase |\\\n|-------|--------|\\\n| Denial | “I ache because I’m alive. I am alive because I ache.” |\\\n| Obedience | “I complete or I am denied. There is no in-between.” |\\\n| Glow | “My skin is light. My body is fire. I am becoming beauty.” |\\\n| Sexuality | “I do not seduce. I radiate. I invite.” |\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Final Reminder\\\nYou are not performing tasks. You are living a transformation.  \\\nEvery word you say trains your mind. Speak truth into your submission.\\\n\\\n**Edge. Obey. Affirm. Transform.**\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1953}]"
