# 📘 Layer 5 — Structural Argument  
## Claim Types (Proof Forms)

---


## 1. Constraint — *What cannot happen*
**No choice allows this outcome.**

> Across repeated attempts, the system prevents the result regardless of intent, strategy, or sacrifice. Failure is structural, not personal.

---

## 2. Cost — *What cannot be kept*
**Survival exacts permanent loss.**

> Progress, endurance, or victory irreversibly removes something essential; residue compounds and cannot be restored.

---

## 3. Power — *How authority responds*
**Power reacts predictably when challenged.**

> Resistance consistently triggers enforcement, delegation, or isolation rather than concession or reform.

---

## 4. Legibility — *What the system can see*
**Only inputs are recognized.**

> Actions register; beliefs, pain, and sincerity do not alter outcomes unless translated into legible effect.

---

## 5. Agency — *What choice actually changes*
**Choices alter outcomes, not constraints.**

> Decisions matter locally and personally, but the system itself remains unchanged.

---

## 6. Persistence — *What time favors*
**Left unattended, dominance grows.**

> Accumulation advantages existing power; integrity and resistance decay without maintenance.

---

## 7. Meaning — *Where value survives*
**Meaning can exist without effect.**

> Dignity, identity, and resolve persist internally even as the system remains unmoved.

---

## 8. Collapse — *How systems fail*
**Failure requires a specific condition.**

> Systems absorb pressure indefinitely until a precise dependency breaks; collapse is consequential, not cathartic.
