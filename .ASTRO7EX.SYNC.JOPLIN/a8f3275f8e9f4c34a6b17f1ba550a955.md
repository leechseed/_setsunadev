they don’t prevent it.  \\\n- Gunfire attracts ARC and players.  \\\n- Downing a player triggers a loud, visible **death flare**.  \\\n\\\n### **Stealth Practices**\\\n- Move quietly (avoid running unless escaping).  \\\n- Use firefights elsewhere as distractions.  \\\n- Throw manual flares to misdirect.  \\\n- When downed, crawl to a hidden spot to deny loot.  \\\n- Favor weapons with high **stealth rating**.\\\n\\\n### **Suppressors**\\\n- Cannot silence a weapon.  \\\n- Simply reduce detection radius.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **Field Crafting & Mid-Raid Sustain**\\\n\\\n## **Mental Model:**  \\\n**“Crafting is your emergency life-support.”**\\\n\\\n### **What You Can Craft Mid-Raid**\\\n- Basic bandages  \\\n- Shield chargers  \\\n- Fabric → small healing  \\\n- ARC Powercells → small shield recharge  \\\n\\\n### **Shield Durability**\\\n- Heavy hits drain shield durability quickly.  \\\n- Zero durability = shield disabled until repaired in town.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# **The Seven Laws of Good Raiding**\\\n\\\n1. **Know your goal before you load in.**  \\\n2. **Check extracts and plan your escape immediately.**  \\\n3. **Use Hatch Keys unless it's a Night Raid.**  \\\n4. **Upgrade weapons thoughtfully — repairs scale with Mark.**  \\\n5. **Blueprints are RNG — open more containers.**  \\\n6. **Stealth beats aggression — sound gets you killed.**  \\\n7. **Field crafting keeps you alive long enough to extract.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5343}]"
