Put simply: it’s where “flat” meets “far.”\\\n- **Vanishing Point (VP)** → Where parallel lines (in 3D) appear to meet in 2D.\\\n- **1/2/3-Point Perspective** → One VP (frontal), two VPs (corner view), three VPs (tilt up/down adds vertical convergence).\\\n- **Curvilinear (4/5-Point)** → Fisheye-like perspective mapping across a curved field; used sparingly.\\\n- **Foreshortening** → Apparent compression of lengths pointing toward/away from the viewer.\\\n- **Occlusion / Overlap** → One object blocking part of another—our strongest depth cue.\\\n- **Atmospheric Perspective** → Distance reduces contrast, saturation, and sharpness; shifts color cooler/lighter.\\\n- **Value Key** → Overall lightness bias of the image (high-key = mostly light, low-key = mostly dark).\\\n- **Value Stepping** → Deliberate value differences between planes (fore darker, mid midtone, distance lighter—*or* the reverse).\\\n- **Cast Shadow vs Form Shadow** → Cast = shadow thrown onto other surfaces; Form = shadow on the object itself because it turns away from light.\\\n- **Terminator** → The line where light turns to shadow on a curved form.\\\n- **Ambient Occlusion (AO)** → Soft darkening in tight creases/contacts where light can’t reach.\\\n- **Rim Light** → Thin highlight that separates a subject from background.\\\n- **Depth of Field (DoF)** → The range that appears acceptably sharp. Narrow DoF isolates; deep DoF explains context.\\\n- **Hyperfocal Distance** → Focus distance that maximizes depth of field from roughly half that distance to infinity.\\\n- **Circle of Confusion (CoC)** → The blur circle size your system treats as “sharp enough.” Smaller CoC = stricter sharpness.\\\n- **Keystone Distortion** → Converging verticals when camera is tilted; fix by leveling or perspective correction.\\\n- **Parallax** → Near objects shift more than far ones when the camera/viewer moves.\\\n- **Dolly Zoom (Vertigo Effect)** → Zoom while dollying to keep subject size constant but warp background scale—weaponized depth.\\\n\\\n> Depth is **not** a single trick. It’s the **stack**: planes + perspective + values + edges + atmosphere + lens behavior.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## How to Use This Guide\\\n- Start with **planes** and **perspective** (geometry), then enforce with **value stepping**, **color falloff**, and **edge control**.\\\n- Decide your **value key** early; it dictates how you step planes.\\\n- Choose **one** lens behavior (wide exaggeration vs tele compression) and design around it—don’t fight it.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Depth Building Blocks\\\n\\\n### 3.1 Planes: Fore / Mid / Back\\\n**What**  \\\nAt minimum, show **three layers**. The brain expects this.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Plant a **foreground anchor** (silhouette, frame, or texture).  \\\n- Stage the **subject** in mid; reserve **background** for separation.  \\\n- Ensure value/edge differences between planes.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nIf flat: add a near-plane object (even a soft dark shape) and push the background lighter/softer.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Can you label three planes in one second? If not, add or separate them.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.2 Occlusion & Overlap\\\n**What**  \\\nFront objects **cover** back objects → instant depth.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Overlap decisively; avoid **kissing tangents**.  \\\n- Use occlusion to clarify figure–ground.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nIf edges just touch, **separate** or **overlap** clearly; adjust pose/prop to break coincidence.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.3 Scale & Diminution\\\n**What**  \\\nThings shrink with distance.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Include a known-size object (human, doorway) as a **scale reference**.  \\\n- Step sizes consistently into depth.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nIf the world feels toy-like, your scale steps are too aggressive or lens too wide without a foreground anchor.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.4 Atmospheric Perspective\\\n**What**  \\\nAir eats contrast and saturation with distance.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Distance: **lighter**, **bluer/cooler**, **less saturated**, **less sharp**.  \\\n- Foreground: **richer**, **warmer**, **sharper**.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nLift background blacks and drop saturation by 10–40%. Add mild bluish tint far back.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.5 Value Key & Stepping\\\n**What**  \\\nAssign distinct value ranges to planes.\\\n\\\n**Patterns**  \\\n- **High-key landscape**: Fore (mid–dark), Mid (mid), Back (light).  \\\n- **Noir** (reverse): Fore (light rim on dark), Mid (dark mass), Back (mid).\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nIf planes merge, push the **delta** between them. Values lead; color follows.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.6 Color & Saturation Falloff\\\n**What**  \\\nSaturation drops with distance; warms advance, cools recede.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Keep **warm accents** in near/mid; cool the background.  \\\n- One **hot accent** near the subject; keep background neutral.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nColor noise? Reduce hue spread; unify background temperature.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.7 Texture & Detail Gradients\\\n**What**  \\\nFine detail lives **near**; distance blurs it.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Highest **micro-contrast** at the subject; simplify texture elsewhere.  \\\n- Use frequency separation: big shapes at distance, fine texture up close.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nIf attention scatters, kill micro-contrast in the background.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.8 Edge Hierarchy in Depth\\\n**What**  \\\nSharp edges advance; soft edges recede.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Keep the **5 sharpest edges** around the subject plane.  \\\n- Use **lost edges** where background and subject share a value (away from focal).\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nRandom crispness? Blur offenders; sharpen only where you want the eye.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.9 Light & Shadow (Form, Cast, Rim, Volumetrics)\\\n**What**  \\\nLight sculpts depth.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- **Form shadow** defines curvature (terminator clean and logical).  \\\n- **Cast shadows** glue objects to ground (direction consistent; **contact shadow** darkest).  \\\n- **Rim light** for separation against darker backgrounds.  \\\n- **Volumetric** shafts (god rays) imply space when they cut through haze.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nConfused lighting? Pick **one** key light, one fill strategy, and a consistent shadow direction.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.10 Perspective Systems (Eye Level, 1/2/3-Point, Curvilinear)\\\n**What**  \\\nGeometry that tells the viewer how they’re oriented.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Mark **eye level** first.  \\\n- **1-point**: look straight down an axis (hallway); one VP on horizon.  \\\n- **2-point**: look at a **corner**; two VPs on horizon.  \\\n- **3-point**: tilt up/down; verticals converge to a third VP.  \\\n- **Curvilinear** (4/5-point): only when you *want* fisheye.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- **Keystone** verticals by leveling camera or correcting in post.  \\\n- If VPs drift, build a **perspective grid** and snap to it.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.11 Foreshortening & Gesture in Space\\\n**What**  \\\nForms pointing at you compress.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Lead with **big shapes**; sub-shapes diminish rapidly along the axis.  \\\n- Preserve **cross-contours** to explain turning form.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nRubber-arm syndrome? You kept segment lengths constant. Shorten each segment toward camera.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.12 Depth of Field & Focus Control\\\n**What**  \\\nFocus directs depth and attention.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- **Shallow DoF**: isolate subject; blur fore/back.  \\\n- **Deep DoF**: storytelling environments.  \\\n- Set **hyperfocal** for landscapes (sharp from near to infinity).  \\\n- **Focus stacking** for macro/product.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nIf nothing is crisp, raise f-stop or place focus exactly on the subject’s **contrast edge** (eyes for portraits).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.13 Parallax & Motion Cues\\\n**What**  \\\nMovement reveals layers.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Pan with subject: background streaks, subject stays crisp.  \\\n- **Dolly zoom**: keep subject size, change background scale for dramatic depth warp.  \\\n- In animation/boards: slide near layer faster than far layer.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nIf motion confuses, keep **one crisp island**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.14 Framing for Depth\\\n**What**  \\\nUse near objects as **frames** (arches, foliage, doorways).\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Foreground darker/softer; subject brighter/sharper inside.  \\\n- Frames should **point inward**, not compete.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nIf frame steals attention, drop its contrast/texture.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.15 Negative Space as Distance\\\n**What**  \\\nEmpty areas can read as air between planes.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Use **graduated** backgrounds (value/temperature shift) to imply range.  \\\n- Leave breathing room between planes; avoid “stuck together” shapes.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.16 Reflections, Transparency & Planes\\\n**What**  \\\nMirrors/water/windows add spatial planes.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Keep reflected **value lower** than the source (usually).  \\\n- For glass, show **two edges** (near/far) and slight distortions.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\nIf reflection dominates, darken it or break with ripples/angle.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Genre Playbooks for Depth\\\n\\\n- **Landscape**  \\\n  - Foreground anchor (rock/grass), mid subject (tree/structure), aerial perspective to horizon.  \\\n  - Hyperfocal focus; horizon away from heads; grad ND or value gradient for sky.\\\n\\\n- **Portrait**  \\\n  - Subject mid-plane; soft foreground occluder (plant, chair back).  \\\n  - Separate with rim light; background 1–2 stops lower contrast.\\\n\\\n- **Architecture**  \\\n  - Correct verticals (no accidental keystone).  \\\n  - Repeating elements as scale steps; reflective surfaces as extra planes.\\\n\\\n- **Still Life / Product**  \\\n  - Cast shadows for grounding; AO at contacts; shallow DoF or staged ramps.  \\\n  - Keep background texture low to prevent depth noise.\\\n\\\n- **Street / Documentary**  \\\n  - Layer silhouettes; frame with doorways; atmospheric haze (backlight) on busy streets.\\\n\\\n- **Action / Sports**  \\\n  - Diagonals + parallax via panning; foreground streaks; subject rim-lit off background.\\\n\\\n- **Film / Storyboards**  \\\n  - Establish eye level; keep it consistent across reverse shots.  \\\n  - Foreground “dirty” frames to sell depth; haze for night exteriors.\\\n\\\n- **UI / Data Viz**  \\\n  - Use **elevation** (shadow, blur) sparingly; depth cues must not kill readability.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Diagnostics & Stress Tests\\\n\\\n- **Three-Plane Test** → Can you name fore/mid/back instantly? If not, add them.  \\\n- **Grayscale Check** → Do the planes separate in **value** without color?  \\\n- **Edge Audit** → Are the **sharpest edges** on the subject plane?  \\\n- **Silhouette Pass** → Subject reads in silhouette against background?  \\\n- **Perspective Grid** → Do major edges actually converge to the chosen VPs?  \\\n- **Haze Sweep** → Background blacks lifted? Saturation tapered with distance?  \\\n- **Flip & Squint** → Depth should survive inversion and blur.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Exercises That Build Skill Fast\\\n\\\n1. **Plane Builder (10 min)**  \\\n   - From any ref, block **only** three flat values for fore/mid/back. No details.\\\n\\\n2. **AO & Cast Shadow Drill**  \\\n   - Paint base tones; add only AO and cast shadows. Watch forms glue to ground.\\\n\\\n3. **Value Stepping Ladder**  \\\n   - Create 5 thumbnails varying plane values (dark fore → light back; reverse; mid sandwich). Note which pops.\\\n\\\n4. **Perspective Walk**  \\\n   - Draw a simple street in 1-point, 2-point, 3-point. Mark eye level in bold. Place figures to scale.\\\n\\\n5. **Foreshortening Chunks**  \\\n   - Cylinders/boxes pointing at camera. Halve segment lengths toward the viewer; add cross-contours.\\\n\\\n6. **Lens Twins**  \\\n   - Frame the same subject “wide exaggeration” vs “tele compression.” Annotate what changes in depth cues.\\\n\\\n7. **Parallax Loop**  \\\n   - Make a 4-frame sequence sliding foreground faster than background; keep subject crisp.\\\n\\\n8. **DoF Island**  \\\n   - Build a scene where **one** plane is sharp. Everything else soft. Make it still read.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)\\\n\\\n- **Kissing Tangents** → Depth collapses.  \\\n  *Cure*: Overlap decisively or separate with value.\\\n\\\n- **Midtone Soup** → No plane separation.  \\\n  *Cure*: Value stepping; push deltas.\\\n\\\n- **Random Sharpness** → Eye ping-pongs.  \\\n  *Cure*: Edge hierarchy—sharpen the subject plane only.\\\n\\\n- **Accidental Keystone** → Feels wrong, not dynamic.  \\\n  *Cure*: Level camera or correct verticals.\\\n\\\n- **Color-Only Depth** → Dies in grayscale.  \\\n  *Cure*: Build with values first; let color assist.\\\n\\\n- **Background Too Loud** → Subject lost.  \\\n  *Cure*: Desaturate/soften background; add rim or silhouette contrast.\\\n\\\n- **One-Plane Lighting** → Everything lit the same.  \\\n  *Cure*: Directional key + controlled falloff; shadow mass to unify.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Workflow & Setup (Overlays, Tools, Lenses)\\\n\\\n- **Overlays**: Perspective grids (1/2/3-point), horizon bars, haze gradients, edge-sharpness masks.  \\\n- **Apps**:  \\\n  - Photoshop/Krita: perspective grid layers; Gradient Map for aerial perspective; Lens Correction for keystone.  \\\n  - Procreate: add perspective guide; Gaussian Blur for DoF tests; color balance for cool-back warms.  \\\n- **Cameras/Lenses**:  \\\n  - **Wide (14–35mm FF)** exaggerates depth; needs a **foreground anchor**.  \\\n  - **Tele (85–200mm+)** compresses depth; great for layered silhouettes and subject isolation.  \\\n  - Use **tripod + level** for architecture; stop down for deep DoF landscapes; open up for portrait isolation.  \\\n  - Remember **hyperfocal** charts (or app) for “everything-sharp” landscapes.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Cheat Sheet Summary\\\n\\\n- Depth = **planes + perspective + values + edges + atmosphere + lens behavior**.  \\\n- Pick a **value key** and **step** your planes.  \\\n- Overlap decisively; protect silhouettes; reserve **sharpest edges** for the subject plane.  \\\n- Cool, desaturate, and soften the background; warm, saturate, and sharpen near/mid.  \\\n- Choose lens behavior and commit: **wide = exaggerate**, **tele = compress**.  \\\n- If it fails in **grayscale** and **blur**, it isn’t built yet.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Extended Glossary\\\n\\\n- **Ambient Occlusion (AO)** → Soft contact darkening where light can’t reach (creases, ground contact).  \\\n- **Cast Shadow** → Shadow thrown by an object onto another surface; carries shape info and direction.  \\\n- **Circle of Confusion (CoC)** → The blur diameter considered “sharp enough” by your sensor/print standard.  \\\n- **Curvilinear Perspective** → Mapping straight lines to curves (fisheye) for ultra-wide views.  \\\n- **Diminution** → Progressive size reduction with distance; basic perspective cue.  \\\n- **Dolly Zoom** → Simultaneous dolly and opposite-direction zoom; background scale distorts while subject size holds.  \\\n- **Eye Level / Horizon** → Plane at viewer’s eye height; determines VP placement.  \\\n- **Foreshortening** → Compression of lengths toward the viewer; requires aggressive shortening of segments.  \\\n- **Form Shadow / Terminator** → Intrinsic shadow on a form; terminator is the transition edge.  \\\n- **Hyperfocal Distance** → Focus point that maximizes depth of field to infinity for a given aperture/FOV/CoC.  \\\n- **Keystone** → Converging verticals from camera tilt; fix by leveling or post correction.  \\\n- **Parallax** → Relative motion of near vs far objects during camera/viewer movement; stronger near = deeper feel.  \\\n- **Rim Light** → Narrow highlight that separates subject from background.  \\\n- **Value Key** → Overall lightness bias of the image (high-, mid-, low-key).  \\\n- **Value Stepping** → Assigning distinct value bands to planes for separation.  \\\n- **Vanishing Point** → Apparent meeting point of parallels in perspective.  \\\n- **Volumetric Light** → Visible beams through haze/particles that describe space.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":17311}]"
