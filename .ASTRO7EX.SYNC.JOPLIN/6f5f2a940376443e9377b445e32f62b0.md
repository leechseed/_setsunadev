# WORK DOWN THE PAGE — Suspense Beat Builder

---

### **Steps**
1. **Find moments** in your script that need additional suspense or build to a surprise.  
2. **Break scene direction into beats** and work **down the page** (one beat per line/short paragraph).

---

### **Target Moment**
- **Scene ID / Title:**  
  > 
- **Type of Tension (mystery / suspense / surprise):**  
  > 
- **What must the audience feel/learn by the end of this moment?**  
  > 

---

### **Beat Sheet (Work Down the Page)**
> Keep beats short. Each line = one visual/action change, clue, reversal, or question.

| # | Beat (1–2 lines max) | Function (clue / question / mislead / reversal / escalation / button) | POV |
|---|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| 1 |                       |                                                                         |     |
| 2 |                       |                                                                         |     |
| 3 |                       |                                                                         |     |
| 4 |                       |                                                                         |     |
| 5 |                       |                                                                         |     |
| 6 |                       |                                                                         |     |

### **Suspense Tools (Pick and Place into Beats)**
- **Delay disclosure:** withhold the obvious answer for 1–2 beats.  
- **Plant & pay off:** plant a detail early; pay it off later in the list.  
- **Misdirect:** offer a plausible but wrong interpretation.  
- **Escalate stakes:** shrink options, add time pressure, or narrow space.  
- **Tight POV:** anchor on one character’s senses; limit what we know.  
- **Button:** end the page/section on an image or question that compels the next beat.

---

### **Page Layout Guidelines**
- One **beat per paragraph**; prefer **short lines**.  
- **White space** = tension. Use blank lines to pace.  
- Prefer **actions and sensory cues** over camera terms.  
- Keep **verbs active**, avoid “we see.”

---

### **Revision Checklist**
- [ ] Every beat changes **information, emotion, or danger**.  
- [ ] At least one **mislead** before the reveal.  
- [ ] A **plant** lands before its **payoff**.  
- [ ] **POV** is consistent (or shifts are clearly marked).  
- [ ] The sequence ends with a clear **button** (image/question/turn).
