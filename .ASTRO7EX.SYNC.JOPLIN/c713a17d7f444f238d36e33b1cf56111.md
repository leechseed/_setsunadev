# 📘 Composition — Color & Weight (Deep Guide)

> Color gets too much credit and not enough discipline. **Value wins first read**, edges lock it, and color either supports that or wrecks it. Here’s how to use color to *pull weight* on purpose.

## Terminology Primer (Read First)

- **Hue** → The “named” color (red, blue, etc.).  
- **Value** → Lightness/darkness of a color (independent of hue).  
- **Value Contrast** → Difference in value between adjacent shapes. Biggest lever for first read.  
- **Saturation** *(UI tools term)* → Intensity of color from gray to vivid.  
- **Chroma** *(perceptual)* → The perceived strength of a color relative to a similarly illuminated gray. Close to saturation; treat as “how punchy it feels.”  
- **Lightness / Luma / Luminance** → Different models of “how bright it looks.” Tool UIs mix these; don’t obsess—use grayscale previews to judge value.  
- **Temperature** → Warm (reds/oranges/yellows) vs cool (blues/cyans). Warm feels nearer; cool recedes (usually).  
- **Gamut** → The range of colors a device/space can show (sRGB, Display P3, Adobe RGB, CMYK).  
- **Simultaneous Contrast** → A color shifts appearance based on neighbors (blue looks more vibrant next to orange, etc.).  
- **Edge Sharpness** → Abruptness of transitions. Hard edges attract; soft edges recede.  
- **Color Constancy** → The brain auto-corrects lighting; cameras do not. Fix white balance.  
- **Metamerism** → Two swatches match under one light but not another. Beware for print.  
- **Helmholtz–Kohlrausch Effect** → Very saturated colors can *feel* brighter than their measured luminance. Translation: saturation adds **weight**.

> Tattoo this: **Value first. Edge second. Color third.** Color *amplifies* weight; it is not a substitute for value design.

---

## How to Use This Guide
- **Lock value** structure in grayscale, then layer **temperature** and **saturation** to steer attention.  
- Use **one dominant palette idea** (analogous, complementary, etc.). Don’t mix schemes.  
- Limit **hot accents** to where the story needs them—usually the focal and stepping stones.

---

## Attention Physics: What Actually Pulls the Eye
Perceptual “weight” increases with:

1. **Value contrast** (biggest jump wins)
2. **Edge sharpness** (crisper = heavier)
3. **Saturation/chroma** (punchier = heavier)
4. **Warmth** (warm > cool, generally)
5. **Detail/micro-contrast** (texture attracts)
6. **Faces/text/symbols** (semantic magnets)
7. **Area & isolation** (big solitary patches weigh more)

**Heuristic (rough mental math)**  
`Weight ≈ Area × (ValueFactor × EdgeFactor × SaturationFactor × WarmthFactor × DetailFactor)`  
Use it to decide if a small red accent can balance a large dull mass (it often can).

---

## Contrast Playbook (The Useful Ones)
Forget the full art-school list—here are the ones you’ll actually use and how:

- **Light–Dark (Value) Contrast**  
  - Make the focal the highest value jump (light-on-dark or dark-on-light).

- **Warm–Cool Contrast**  
  - Warm focal in a cool field = instant pull. Reverse for icy stories.

- **Complementary Contrast (Opposites on the wheel)**  
  - Red/green, blue/orange, yellow/purple. Use **one** pair; keep the field muted.

- **Saturation Contrast**  
  - One saturated accent in a desaturated world = spotlight. Don’t pepper saturation everywhere.

- **Contrast of Proportion (Color “extension”)**  
  - Small amount of hot hue can balance a sea of calm hue. E.g., 5% red vs 95% desaturated cyan.

- **Simultaneous Contrast (Context shift)**  
  - Surround a hue with its near-complement to intensify it (orange wall makes blue product pop).

> Stack two contrasts at the focal (e.g., value + saturation). Save the third for the final punch if needed.

---

## Palette Architecture (Dominant / Subdominant / Accent)
- **Dominant (≈60%)** → Neutral or softly colored field (pick a temperature).  
- **Subdominant (≈30%)** → Harmonizing hue with lower saturation or value contrast.  
- **Accent (≈10% → often 3–5%)** → The saturated, warm or high-contrast spike at the focal.

**Rules**
- Keep accent **local** and **unique**. If everything’s an accent, nothing is.  
- Echo the accent **tiny** elsewhere as stepping stones (micro-doses only).

---

## Temperature & Atmosphere (Warm/Cool Control)
- **Depth**: Warm near, cool far (pairs well with aerial perspective).  
- **Skin**: Keep undertones warm-neutral; let background run cooler.  
- **Metal/Glass**: Neutral to cool with **warm highlights** for snap.  
- **Night**: Cool base with **select warm pools** (windows, fires, skin).

**White Balance Discipline**
- Pick a key white balance and stick to it across a sequence. Mixed lighting = mud unless motivated.

---

## Saturation, Chroma & Restraint
- Start **desaturated**; add saturation **only** at the focal and stepping stones.  
- Prefer **Vibrance** (protects skin/low-sat hues) over blunt Saturation sliders.  
- Watch channel clipping—high sat + high value = ugly banding on export.

**Helmholtz–Kohlrausch Reality Check**  
- Ultra-saturated patches *feel* bright; don’t let them hijack value hierarchy. If they do, lower saturation or lower edges there.

---

## Value–Color Interlock (Build in B/W, Win in Color)
- Build a **3-value Notan** first (black/gray/white).  
- Map hues **on top** of established values:  
  - Light area can be warm or cool—just keep it **light**.  
  - Dark area can host saturated color—just keep it **dark**.

**Value-Locked Palettes**
- Monochrome value plan with hue variation = stable, stylish.  
- If color breaks the read in grayscale, **your values are wrong**. Fix those before hue tweaks.

---

## Harmony Schemes that Actually Ship
- **Monochrome** → One hue, value/sat variations. Calm, brandable.  
- **Analogous (2–3 neighbors)** → Cohesive, low conflict; use complementary accent sparingly.  
- **Complementary** → One hue muted for field, the other as accent. Don’t 50/50 it.  
- **Split Complementary** → Safer, more flexible complementary (e.g., blue vs red–orange & yellow–orange).  
- **Triadic (three evenly spaced hues)** → Keep two muted, one accented, or it turns into a circus.  
- **Tetradic (double complementary)** → Only if you’re disciplined. Lock values first, assign roles (dominant/sub/accents).

---

## Material & Subject Recipes
- **Skin (all tones)**: Value first; saturation restrained. Warm mids, neutral shadows, *select* cool in bounce/ambient.  
- **Foliage**: Avoid neon green. Push toward warm sunlight in lights, cooler blue-greens in shade.  
- **Sky/Water**: Gradient is king (value & temperature). Warm near horizon, cooler zenith; reflections darker than sky.  
- **Metal**: Big value swings, tight speculars; let environment color drive the metal, not a spray of white.  
- **Fire/Neon**: Saturation doomsday—put it in **value-appropriate** range and kill competing edges nearby.  
- **UI CTA Buttons**: Accent color reserved; ensure value contrast against background and text.

---

## Genre Shortcuts (Color by Context)
- **Landscape**: Cool distance, warm foreground accents; keep saturation on a leash.  
- **Portrait**: Skin priority; background cooler/duller; one wardrobe color gets to sing.  
- **Product**: Neutral field; brand color as accent; speculars controlled; label legibility beats everything.  
- **Architecture**: Planar neutrals; temperature contrast via practicals/daylight.  
- **Concept/Key Art**: Two-hue story max + accent; color script across images for continuity.  
- **UI/UX**: Neutral base, one accent family; reserve red for errors/warnings or it loses meaning.

---

## Accessibility & Readability (Don’t Fail Humans)
- **Text over background**: Aim for strong **value contrast**—don’t rely on hue difference.  
- Body text should meet typical contrast targets (rule of thumb: dark text on light or vice versa; avoid mid-on-mid).  
- **Color isn’t data**: Encode with shape/position/labels too. Assume some users can’t see your chosen red–green contrast.  
- Test with **grayscale** and common color-vision filters (protan/deutan).

---

## Diagnostics & Stress Tests
- **Grayscale Toggle** → Does the focal still win? If not, your color is faking it.  
- **Saturation Kill** → Drop global saturation to 0; should still read.  
- **Accent Budget** → Count accents. More than 1–2 real accents? You’re leaking attention.  
- **Corner Audit** → Any bright/saturated corners? Kill or redirect.  
- **Heat Map Sketch** → Circle the three heaviest color weights. Do they land where you wanted?  
- **White Balance Sweep** → Warm and cool the whole frame ±1000K (or equivalent). Pick one and stick with it.

## Exercises That Build Skill Fast
1. **Gray-First Paint**  
   - Fully render in grayscale; colorize with Gradient Map/Color layers. Keep the read identical.

2. **Accent Discipline**  
   - One image, allow **only 5%** of pixels to exceed a saturation threshold. Place them at the focal.

3. **Warm–Cool Ramps**  
   - Paint a still life twice: warm key/cool fill vs cool key/warm fill. Compare depth and mood.

4. **Harmony Triplet**  
   - Ship the same comp as Analogous, Complementary, and Triadic. Keep values constant; judge speed of read.

5. **Brand Safe**  
   - Build a UI with a neutral base and **one** accent family. Add a second accent and watch the CTA die. Remove it.

6. **Material Studies**  
   - Metal, glass, skin, foliage—four 30-minute studies focused on value swings and controlled speculars.

## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)
- **Color-Only Contrast** → Dies in B/W.  
  *Cure*: Rebuild value hierarchy; color last.

- **Too Many Hues** → Noise.  
  *Cure*: Pick a scheme; mute the field; one accent.

- **Over-Saturation** → Cheap look, banding, lost form.  
  *Cure*: Pull back sat, push value contrast and edges at the focal.

- **Mixed White Balance** → Mud.  
  *Cure*: Pick a key WB; neutralize or lean intentionally.

- **Hot Corners** → Leaks.  
  *Cure*: Desaturate/darken corners; use blockers/vignettes.

- **Red Everywhere** → Alarm fatigue.  
  *Cure*: Reserve red for error/alert or single hero accent.

- **CMYK Surprise** → Print looks dull.  
  *Cure*: Soft proof CMYK, constrain gamut, don’t rely on neon RGB.

---

## Workflow & Setup (Profiles, Export, Tools)
- **Work Space**: Use **sRGB** for web unless you *know* your pipeline supports Display P3. For print, soft-proof the target **CMYK ICC**.  
- **Monitor**: Calibrate. If you won’t, accept that your color decisions are guesses.  
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit for heavy grading to avoid banding; dither on export if needed.  
- **White Balance**: Shoot a gray card or key on a known neutral; sync WB across sets.  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Gradient Map / Selective Color / Curves** > global Saturation sledgehammer.  
  - **LAB** tweaks for targeted color without wrecking value (advanced; use carefully).  
  - **LUTs**: Use as seasoning, not a crutch; always re-check values.  
- **Export**: Embed profile; for web, convert to sRGB; test on a phone and a cheap laptop (worst-case reality).

---

## Cheat Sheet Summary
- **Value wins.** If it fails in grayscale, fix values first.  
- **Limit accents.** One saturated/warm accent near the focal beats ten scattered pops.  
- **Control temperature.** Warm near/cool far is depth on a platter.  
- **Build a palette.** Dominant 60% + Sub 30% + Accent ≤10%.  
- **Protect edges.** Hard at the focal, soft elsewhere—color won’t save sloppy edges.  
- **Export sanely.** sRGB for web, proof CMYK for print, calibrate or accept roulette.

## Extended Glossary
- **Accent (Color)** → A small, high-saturation or high-contrast color used to pull attention.  
- **Analogous** → Neighboring hues on the wheel; cohesive with low conflict.  
- **Chroma** → Perceived color strength; similar to saturation but rooted in human vision models.  
- **Complementary** → Opposite hues; high tension—use one as field, the other as accent.  
- **Gamut** → The color range a device/profile can reproduce (sRGB < P3 < AdobeRGB; CMYK smaller but print-ink dependent).  
- **Gradient Map** → Maps values to a color ramp; powerful for keeping value–color alignment.  
- **Lightness/Luminance/Luma** → Different measures of brightness (model-dependent). Use grayscale previews to judge composition.  
- **Metamerism** → Matches under one light fail under another; print trap.  
- **Monochrome** → Single hue with value/saturation variation.  
- **Notan** → 2–3 value abstraction that defines read before color.  
- **Simultaneous Contrast** → Colors alter each other’s appearance when adjacent.  
- **Split Complementary** → A hue plus the two neighbors of its complement; safer complementary.  
- **Triadic/Tetradic** → Three/four evenly spaced hues; requires strict value control.  
- **Value** → Light/dark level; primary driver of legibility.  
- **Value Contrast** → Strength of the light–dark difference; biggest attention magnet.  
- **Vibrance** → Saturation variant that protects skin/low-sat hues; safer global control.  
- **White Balance (WB)** → Neutral color baseline for a scene; set it on purpose.
