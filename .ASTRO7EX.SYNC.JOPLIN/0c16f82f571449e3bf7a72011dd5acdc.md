## 1. Overview

This document outlines the four major **Plot Choices** made in the Dramatica Storyforming process for **ASTRO7EX**. These choices define the **external structure** of the narrative arc and interact directly with Vivian’s previously locked Main Character dynamics. Together, they form the **pressure mechanics** of the story’s engine.

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### 🎬 Story Driver: **Actions Force Decisions**

- Events—like AI resurrection, memory erasure, and betrayals—*trigger* character responses.
- Vivian is not a planner; she’s a reactor.  
- Fits her Scorpio Mercury + Pisces Moon dynamic: external stimuli lead to internal reaction.
- Builds a world where control is an illusion, and choice emerges from chaos.

---

### ⏳ Story Limit: **Optionlock**

- The pressure is **not time**—it’s **dwindling choices**.
- Vivian and the cast lose options as the system collapses around them.
- Astrology: Capricorn Saturn + Scorpio Mercury = resilience in tightening circumstances.
- Tension increases not by countdown, but by **constriction of pathways**.

---

### ❌ Story Outcome: **Failure**

- The external Story Goal—shutting down the AI, exposing the system—is not achieved.
- The Godking legacy or its propagators remain, at least partially functional.
- Structural collapse may be mitigated, but the damage is not undone.

---

### ✅ Story Judgment: **Good**

- Vivian finds **internal resolution**, despite external failure.
- Her soul survives. She reclaims the truth of who she is and resists becoming another system casualty.
- This echoes her Steadfast resolve: *She does not change, but she is proven right to resist.*

## 4. Narrative Alignment

| Character/Element | Value          |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Main Character** | Vivian         |
| **Resolve**        | Steadfast      |
| **Growth**         | Stop           |
| **Approach**       | Do-er          |
| **Problem Style**  | Intuitive      |
| **Story Driver**   | Action         |
| **Story Limit**    | Optionlock     |
| **Story Outcome**  | Failure        |
| **Story Judgment** | Good           |

### Story Signature:
> **"When the world demanded she bend, Vivian held."**  
> The mission failed, the system endured, but she did not break.
