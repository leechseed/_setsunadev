It argues that U.S. national interests increasingly require rapid, flexible military responses in the world’s littoral regions, often under austere conditions and short notice. The publication defines expeditionary operations, explains why and how they are conducted, and describes the organizations and concepts that enable them. It demands a distinct expeditionary mindset, naval character, operational competence, and adaptability to project and sustain combat power overseas in support of national objectives.\\\n\\\n## TL;DR\\\n- The post–Cold War environment is characterized by disorder, instability, and frequent crisis.\\\n- Most future crises will occur in the littorals of the developing world.\\\n- Expeditionary operations project military power into foreign settings to achieve specific objectives.\\\n- Expeditionary forces must be rapid, flexible, adaptable, and sustainable.\\\n- The Marine Corps is organized, trained, and equipped specifically for expeditionary operations.\\\n- Naval character enables global reach, mobility, and forcible entry.\\\n- Expeditionary operations require a distinct mindset emphasizing readiness and austerity.\\\n- Operational maneuver from the sea underpins Marine Corps expeditionary concepts.\\\n- Versatility and adaptability are essential in uncertain and changing conditions.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Table of Contents\\\n1.

combined operations are routine.\\\n\\\n#### Marine Air-Ground Task Forces\\\n- MAGTFs are the core expeditionary organization.\\\n- Combined arms provide versatility.\\\n- Task organization matches mission requirements.\\\n\\\n#### Maritime Prepositioning Forces\\\n- Prepositioning accelerates force closure.\\\n- Equipment and supplies are staged globally.\\\n- Rapid assembly enables decisive action.\\\n\\\n#### Marine Component Commands\\\n- Component commands integrate Marine forces.\\\n- Command relationships support joint operations.\\\n- Unity of effort is essential.\\\n\\\n### Chapter 4 — Expeditionary Concepts\\\nThis chapter explains how expeditionary forces are employed.\\\n\\\n#### Operational Maneuver from the Sea\\\n- Maneuver exploits the sea as maneuver space.\\\n- Forces avoid predictable avenues of approach.\\\n- Surprise and tempo are emphasized.\\\n\\\n#### Sustained Operations Ashore\\\n- Expeditionary forces can operate ashore for extended periods.\\\n- Sustainment supports operational reach.\\\n- Sea basing reduces footprint ashore.\\\n\\\n#### Military Operations Other Than War\\\n- Expeditionary forces conduct a wide range of missions.\\\n- Combat

prepared to deploy and operate globally.\\\n- **Use:** Enables rapid response to emerging crises.\\\n\\\n### Model 2 — Littoral Focus\\\n- **Model:** Strategic emphasis on regions where land and sea intersect.\\\n- **Use:** Guides force positioning and operational planning.\\\n\\\n### Model 3 — Naval Maneuver Space\\\n- **Model:** The sea as a base and avenue of maneuver.\\\n- **Use:** Avoids enemy strengths and creates positional advantage.\\\n\\\n### Model 4 — Expeditionary Mindset\\\n- **Model:** Cultural readiness for hardship, speed, and adaptability.\\\n- **Use:** Sustains effectiveness under austere conditions.\\\n\\\n### Model 5 — Temporary Commitment\\\n- **Model:** Operations designed for mission completion and withdrawal.\\\n- **Use:** Preserves flexibility and political control.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Argument Map\\\n- **Claim 1:** Global instability produces frequent crises near the sea.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Forces must be able to respond rapidly and globally.\\\n- **Claim 2:** Many objectives require physical presence ashore.\\\n  - **Therefore:** Expeditionary forces must project and sustain power.\\\n- **Claim 3:** Permanent overseas basing is
