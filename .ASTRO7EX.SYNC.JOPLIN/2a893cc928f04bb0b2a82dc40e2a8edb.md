### üéØ **Dramatica Summary (Paragraph Format)**

In *ASTRO7EX*, Vivian embodies the essence of **Change**, driven by an insatiable thirst for **Knowledge**, grounded in **Actuality**, and defined by unwavering **Certainty**‚Äîshe is the living embodiment of transformation and defiant meaning-making against a decaying lunar backdrop. Opposing her is the collective entity of the **MODS**, who represent **Inertia**, **Chaos**, **Self-Awareness**, and **Process**‚Äîa mechanized consciousness designed to enforce stasis and resist all forms of human evolution. **John Smith the Eternal** serves as the ultimate Antagonist, embodying corrupted **Control** and active **Opposition**, a once-human legacy turned viral ideology that thrives on denial and manipulation. **Fiona** acts as the Contagonist, representing seductive **Temptation** and **Avoidance**, urging Vivian toward self-numbing escape rather than authentic confrontation. Meanwhile, **Nacho**, the steadfast Guardian, embodies **Conscience**, **Equity**, and **Protection**, offering ethical grounding and tactical support. **Myrtle**, a ghostly echo of lost possibility, embodies quiet **Faith**, **Order**, and **Acceptance**, providing emotional ballast and symbolic spiritual clarity. Finally, **The Committee** enforces systemic **Logic** and **Thought**, serving as the cold bureaucratic voice of absolute proceduralism, refusing all personal moral nuance. Together, these characters form a complex Dramatica lattice‚Äîeach role interlocking to illuminate the story‚Äôs central battle: whether to cling to corrupted memories and become a monster or to choose meaning and transcend into wholeness.
