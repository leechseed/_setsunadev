## Terminology Primer (Read First)

- **Hero / Hero Image** ‚Üí The primary subject or module that must win first glance.
- **Packshot** ‚Üí Clean, front-facing product shot showing brand/label clearly.
- **Shelf Read** ‚Üí How fast a product is recognized at a small size or in clutter.
- **Key Art** ‚Üí The single canonical promotional image for a film/game/show.
- **Blocking (Staging)** ‚Üí Placement/orientation of subjects to control silhouette and flow.
- **Cheat to Camera** ‚Üí Slightly turning forms so the important face/label reads flat to lens.
- **Practical (Film)** ‚Üí A light source visible in-scene (lamp, window) used as a cue/motivation.
- **Planar Lighting** ‚Üí Light that emphasizes flat planes (useful for packaging, architecture).
- **Specular** ‚Üí Mirror-like highlight; strong specular = glossy, high ‚Äúsnap.‚Äù
- **Inverse Square Law** ‚Üí Light intensity drops fast with distance; use it to control falloff.
- **High-Key / Low-Key** ‚Üí Overall value bias mostly light / mostly dark (see Core Principles).
- **CTA (Call to Action)** ‚Üí Button or instruction that the layout wants clicked, now.

> If a term isn‚Äôt listed here, it‚Äôs defined in earlier guides or in this document‚Äôs **Extended Glossary**.

## How to Use This Guide
- For each genre: grab **Intent & Priorities**, pick **Armature/Flow**, enforce **Depth/Lighting**, then do **Placement/Crop**.  
- Use the **Checklist** ruthlessly. Fix what fails. Don‚Äôt argue with results.

---

## Landscape
**Intent & Priorities**  
Sense of place; scale; atmosphere. First read = subject landmark or light event.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Thirds** for horizon; **S-curve** for roads/rivers; **Diagonal thrust** for slopes.  
- Avoid centering horizon unless symmetry/mirror is the point.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Fore/Mid/Back with **atmospheric perspective**. Foreground anchor (rock, grass, figure).  
- Wide lens? Put something compelling in the near plane or it‚Äôll look empty.

**Light & Color**  
- Low sun for raking texture; protect value hierarchy (sky ‚â† blown).  
- Warm accents in near/mid; cool the distance.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Keep horizon off heads; protect silhouettes (trees, peaks).  
- Crop decisively‚Äîno slivers of almost-something on edges.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Midtone soup; horizon dead center; no foreground; tiny subject lost in noise.

**Checklist**  
Focal in 1 sec? Three planes? Clean horizon? Foreground leads **in**?

**Exercises**  
Three thumbnails per scene: (A) low horizon, (B) high horizon, (C) centered symmetry; compare in grayscale.

---

## Portrait (Headshot & Environmental)
**Intent & Priorities**  
The person‚Äîeyes first‚Äîthen story context (environmental).

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Eyes on upper third / phi**. **C-curve** or **L-composition** to cradle.  
- For environmental: **Diagonal thrust** to lead into subject.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Separate head from background (value, color, or rim).  
- Soft fore occluder for depth; background 1‚Äì2 stops less contrast.

**Light & Color**  
- Catchlights; soft key + controlled fill; avoid raccoon eyes.  
- Skin tones rule; let background be cooler/less saturated.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- **Don‚Äôt crop at neck/chin/wrists/elbows**. Keep lead room in gaze direction.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Horizon through head; busy background; equal sharpness everywhere.

**Checklist**  
Eyes sharp? Clean silhouette? Headroom/chinroom sane? Background muted?

**Exercises**  
One subject, 6 safe crops; then 3 environmental portraits with story props that don‚Äôt steal the read.

---

## Still Life / Product (E-comm & Advertising)
**Intent & Priorities**  
Clarity of form & label (e-comm). Desire & story (advertising).

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Triangles** for sets; **thirds/phi** for hero placement.  
- For ad comps, **Spiral** into brand mark or feature.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Shallow DoF for isolation or deep DoF for sets‚Äîdecide.  
- Cast shadows + AO to glue objects; avoid floating.

**Light & Color**  
- Control **speculars**; define shape with edge highlights.  
- Background simpler than product; brand color as accent only.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Cheat labels **flat to camera**; avoid tangent merges with props.  
- Leave copy space where layout needs it.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Hot, blown speculars; label glare; over-busy surfaces.

**Checklist**  
Brand readable at thumbnail? Form readable in grayscale? No tangent disasters?

**Exercises**  
Shoot a glossy bottle: one broad softbox pass, one hard-edge rim pass. Compare label legibility.

---

## Architecture (Exterior & Interior)
**Intent & Priorities**  
Structure, rhythm, materiality; human scale.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Symmetry** for monuments; **diagonals** for approach; **repetition rhythms** for facades.  
- Interiors: **L-composition** or **1-point** for axial statements; **2-point** for corners.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Correct verticals (no accidental keystone).  
- Layer view: foreground frame (door/column) ‚Üí volume ‚Üí opening/light.

**Light & Color**  
- Planar lighting for materials; avoid mixed color casts unless narrative.  
- Interiors: use **practicals** to anchor warm spots; daylight as cool fill.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Keep lines true; don‚Äôt amputate key features at the frame.  
- Include a human or familiar object occasionally for scale.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Tilted horizons; chaotic furniture; blown windows.

**Checklist**  
Verticals plumb? Clear pathway? Material reads? Exposure range controlled?

**Exercises**  
Same room in 1-point vs 2-point; annotate mood and spatial clarity differences.

---

## Street / Documentary
**Intent & Priorities**

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Thirds** for safety; **diagonals** for motion; **Zig-zag** for layered crowds.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Layer silhouettes; backlight haze/rain for separation.  
- Fore occluders (door frames, people) to sell space.

**Light & Color**  
- Value hierarchy over color. Kill color noise if it hurts the read.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Protect face silhouettes; avoid mergers; leave walk room.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Everything midtone; clutter with no hero; horizon through heads.

**Checklist**  
Subject first in 1 sec? Clean story beat? Exit vectors blocked?

**Exercises**  
Shoot 10 frames with a single value rule: ‚Äúface = brightest junction.‚Äù Cull hard.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Extra **walk room**; crop tighter on trailing side; keep ball/equipment in frame.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Centering by habit; equal sharpness everywhere; clipped limbs.

**Checklist**  
Is direction obvious? Is the hero sharp? Is the moment actually peak?

**Exercises**  
One play, 5 crops. Pick the one that screams speed the loudest in grayscale.

---

## Wildlife / Nature
**Intent & Priorities**  
Behavior + environment; ethics of distance; clarity of animal form.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Thirds/phi** for the head; **L-composition** or **S-curve** for habitat.

- Early/late light; avoid harsh midday unless silhouette is the story.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- **Lead room** in gaze/motion; don‚Äôt amputate tails/ears.  
- Keep horizon off the head/neck.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Busy grass/branches merging with face; tiny subject.

**Checklist**  
Eye visible and sharp? Clean outline? Behavior readable?

**Exercises**  
Compose the same animal once environmental, once isolating; compare narrative feel.

---

## Macro
**Intent & Priorities**  
Form and texture; abstraction vs identification.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Spiral** around focal detail; **C-curve** cradle; **radial** for flowers.

Everything equally crunchy; no focal; background noise.

**Checklist**  
One crisp focal? Background unobtrusive? Edge discipline held?

**Exercises**  
Shoot the same subject with (A) single crisp edge, (B) full stack; decide which serves intent.

---

## Food & Beverage
**Intent & Priorities**  
Appetite appeal; texture; steam/condensation cues.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Triangles** (plate + props); **L-composition** (table edge + prop).  
- **S-curve** for sauces/utensils leading to bite.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Shallow DoF for hero bite; AO at plate contacts; clean background.

**Light & Color**  
- Back/side light for texture; control white balance for appetizing warmth.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Avoid cropping through the main bite; leave room for type if needed.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Greasy glare; dead greens; messy crumbs stealing focus.

**Checklist**  
Texture alive? Whites neutral? Label/bite path clear?
