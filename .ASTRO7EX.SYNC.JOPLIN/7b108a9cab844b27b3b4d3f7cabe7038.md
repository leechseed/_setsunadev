Pilot Episode Development — Layer-Bound Method



# Pilot Episode Development — Layer-Bound Method

This is not “write a pilot.”
This is **prove the system can generate one**.

---

## STEP 1 — Lock the Pilot’s JOB (Non-Negotiable)

Before plot, before characters, answer this in one sentence:

> **What does this pilot exist to prove?**

You must pick **one** Layer 5 claim only.

Examples:

* Constraint: *“No individual action can escape the system.”*
* Cost: *“Survival permanently narrows identity.”*
* Power: *“Power responds the same way regardless of motive.”*
* Meaning: *“Dignity survives without effect.”*

❗ If you try to prove more than one, the pilot will sprawl and fail.

**Your task**:
Reply with the **single Layer 5 claim** you want the pilot to prove.

---

## STEP 2 — Choose the Ending FIRST (Layer 6)

Pick exactly **one terminal state**.

Do this *before* story.

Examples:

* Containment (system holds)
* Attrition (people erode)
* Exhaustion (resistance stops)
* Adaptation (system absorbs threat)
* Fragmentation (local failure, global survival)

Then explicitly say:

* Why **collapse does NOT happen**
* Why **justice does NOT happen**

This prevents cheating later.

**Your task**:
Name the **Layer 6 terminal state** for the pilot.

---

## STEP 3 — Define the Pilot’s Scope (Tight)

A pilot should have:

* **3–5 major scenes**
* **1 primary character POV**
* **1 visible power interface**
* **1 repeated pressure pattern**

No subplots. No lore flexing.

**Your task**:
Confirm:

* Single POV character (name or placeholder)
* The system / authority they collide with

---

## STEP 4 — Scene Skeleton (Layer 4–First)

We outline scenes *only* by **Expression Mechanics**.

Example structure (illustrative only):

| Scene | Dominant Layer 4 Move | What Changes                     |
| ----- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1     | Commit                | Character binds themselves       |
| 2     | Refuse                | System reroutes pressure         |
| 3     | Reveal                | Exposure increases vulnerability |
| 4     | Isolate               | Impact collapses to local        |
| 5     | Close                 | Exit path permanently ends       |

This prevents decorative scenes.

**Your task**:
Approve a **4–5 scene count** for the pilot.

---

## STEP 5 — Bind Layer 3 (Human Interface)

For each scene, pick **one dominant experience** only:

* Compression
* Ritualization
* Defiance without expectation
* Dissociation
* Stubborn continuity
* etc.

No emotional smearing.

---

## STEP 6 — Validate the Argument (Layer 5)

At the end, ask:

> If the protagonist failed completely, would the claim still be true?

If yes → valid pilot
If no → rewrite, not rethink

---

## WHAT WE DO NEXT (Concrete)

If you reply with the following **four answers**, I will generate the full pilot outline cleanly:

1. **Layer 5 claim** the pilot proves
2. **Layer 6 terminal state**
3. **POV character** + **system they collide with**
4. **Scene count** (4 or 5)

No prose yet.
No dialogue yet.
Just the **structural pilot blueprint**.

You’re officially out of theory land now.
