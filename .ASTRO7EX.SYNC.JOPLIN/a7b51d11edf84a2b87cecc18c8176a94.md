# 📘 Narrative Layer Stack — Cheatsheet (Layers 0–6)

> This document is a **rapid-reference cheatsheet**.  
> Each layer answers **one specific question** and forbids specific kinds of narrative cheating.  
> Layers are **hierarchical and one-way**: higher layers express, test, or reveal lower layers—never override them.

---


## Layer 0 — Ontology  
### *What can exist*

- **Defines**: The total set of entities, forces, states, and relationships that are possible.
- **Primary Question**: *What exists in this world at all?*
- **Scope**: Physics, metaphysics, institutions, technologies, entities.
- **Cannot Do**: Resolve conflict, assign meaning, or imply justice.
- **Failure Mode**: Introducing entities or forces ad hoc to solve problems.

> If it doesn’t exist at Layer 0, it cannot matter later.

---

## Layer 1 — Invariants  
### *What is always true*

- **Defines**: Non-negotiable truths that never change.
- **Primary Question**: *What rules cannot be broken?*
- **Scope**: Limits, impossibilities, asymmetries, constants.
- **Cannot Do**: Bend for characters, emotions, or revelations.
- **Failure Mode**: Exceptions, loopholes, or “this time is different.”

> Invariants constrain all outcomes, including endings.

---

## Layer 2 — Systemic Force  
### *How power acts*

- **Defines**: How authority, enforcement, and dominance behave.
- **Primary Question**: *What does power do when challenged?*
- **Scope**: Enforcement, delegation, isolation, containment.
- **Cannot Do**: Care about truth, fairness, or intention.
- **Failure Mode**: Power stopping because it is exposed or persuaded.

> Truth does not interrupt enforcement.

---

## Layer 3 — Human Interface  
### *How it feels to live under constraint*

- **Defines**: Subjective experience of the system.
- **Primary Question**: *What does this reality feel like to inhabit?*
- **Scope**: Identity, emotion, coping, dignity, trauma.
- **Cannot Do**: Create leverage or alter systems by itself.
- **Failure Mode**: Emotion substituting for action or causality.

> Layer 3 provides meaning, not power.

---

## Layer 4 — Expression Mechanics  
### *What moves moment to moment*

- **Defines**: Mechanical actions that transmit pressure.
- **Primary Question**: *What changed in this beat?*
- **Scope**: Commit, Refuse, Reveal, Delay, Escalate, Isolate, Transfer Risk, Close.
- **Cannot Do**: Guarantee success, justice, or resolution.
- **Failure Mode**: Dialogue or emotion with no pressure movement.

> If no move occurred, the scene is decorative.

---

## Layer 5 — Structural Argument  
### *What the story can prove*

- **Defines**: The kinds of truths the narrative demonstrates.
- **Primary Question**: *What remains true even if the protagonist fails?*
- **Scope**: Constraint, Cost, Power, Legibility, Agency, Persistence, Meaning, Collapse.
- **Cannot Do**: Rely on declarations, morals, or one-off events.
- **Failure Mode**: Claims that collapse under counterexample.

> A story argues through consequence, not assertion.

---

## Layer 6 — Terminal States  
### *How it can end*

- **Defines**: Structurally possible end conditions.
- **Primary Question**: *Given everything proven, what outcomes are reachable?*
- **Scope**: Containment, Attrition, Exhaustion, Displacement, Adaptation, Fragmentation, Collapse, Replacement.
- **Cannot Do**: Deliver justice by default or reward effort automatically.
- **Failure Mode**: Cathartic endings without mechanical cause.

> Endings express structure; they do not redeem it.

---

## Stack Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Causality flows **downward only**.
- Higher layers may **express or test**, never **override**.
- Meaning never converts to power by default.
- Collapse requires a **specific failed condition**, not narrative satisfaction.

---

## One-Line Diagnostic

- **If it changes reality** → check Layer 2 or below.  
- **If it changes feeling** → Layer 3.  
- **If it changes options** → Layer 4.  
- **If it proves something** → Layer 5.  
- **If it ends something** → Layer 6.

If you can’t place an element cleanly, it’s leaking across layers.
