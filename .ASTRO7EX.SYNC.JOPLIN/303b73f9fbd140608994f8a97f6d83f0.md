body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"⚡️ Excellent clarifying question. Let’s break it down clearly:\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📙 **Format of ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n### 💥 **Core Format**\\\n\\\n* **Light Novel–Inspired Structure**, but not a traditional Japanese light novel in strictest sense.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### ✨ **What \\\"Light Novel\\\" Means Here**\\\n\\\n* **Text-Heavy, Illustrated**: Primarily text, but punctuated by occasional highly-stylized illustrations to capture key emotional, symbolic, or fight moments.\\\n* **Serialized Chapters**: Broken into arcs and chapters, each roughly the length of a novella installment, released episodically online.\\\n* **Visual Accentuation**: Character spreads, splash pages, or symbolic diagrams that echo the metaphysical and cyber themes.\\\n* **Stylized Language & Inner Monologues**: Deep psychological focus with raw, often fragmented internal narration — similar to many psychological or sci-fi light novels (e.g., *Boogiepop*, *All You Need Is Kill*).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🧬 **Hybridization with Web Serial**\\\n\\\n* While ASTRO7EX takes inspiration from light novel format, its delivery method and audience interaction model align more with **web serials** (online, iterative, community-influenced).\\\n* Less focus on \\\"compact volumes sold as books\\\" and more on living, evolving text drops.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 🎭 **Why \\\"Light Novel\\\" Fits ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n* Emphasizes intense, stylized inner voice and aesthetic impact rather than purely literary traditional prose.\\\n* Supports the use of hyper-stylized visuals to punctuate major psychological or cosmic beats.\\\n* Allows for complex metaphysical battles and abstract scenes that blend text and visual cues seamlessly.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✅ **Summary Statement**\\\n\\\n> **ASTRO7EX is a web serial told in an online text format, using a light novel–inspired structure that fuses deep psychological narration, occasional symbolic illustrations, and serialized episodic releases.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\nIf you'd like, I can also diagram this as a \\\"format blueprint\\\" with breakdowns of volume structure, illustration cues, and episodic milestones. Just say the word!\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2009}]"
