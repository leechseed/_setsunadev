# FOCUS YOUR SCRIPT — Precision Edit Worksheet

Narrow your script’s scope by refining intentions, trimming excess, and committing to bold choices.

---

### **1) Anchor Beginnings and Endings**
- Edit **scene openings/closings** so they pivot back to the **main intention**.
- Each beat should open with clarity and close with payoff.

---

### **2) Eliminate Dead Ends**
- Cut **objects, information, or character rules** that don’t pay off later.
- Ask: *Does this return or transform by Act 3?*

---

### **3) Streamline Supporting Characters**
- Watch for **flip-flopping minor characters**.
- If there isn’t room to explore every side, **commit to one defining trait**.

---

### **4) Cut a Narrative Device**
- Remove a device that dilutes focus (e.g., flashback vs. fantasy sequence).
- Choose the **clearest lens** and sustain it throughout.

---

### **5) Final Showdown Choreography**
- Smooth out the **last confrontation**.
- Commit to **one bold, clever move** that defines the climax.

---

### **Focus Pass Checklist**
- [ ] Scene openings/closings return to intention.  
- [ ] No unused objects, info, or rules remain.  
- [ ] Supporting/minor characters stay consistent.  
- [ ] Narrative devices trimmed to one clear approach.  
- [ ] Final showdown features a bold signature move.
