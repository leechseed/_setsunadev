This thematic issue emerges at the intersection between **Vivian** (Main Character) and the **MODS** (Impact Characters). It defines the **emotional and philosophical terrain** of their relationship—what is at stake, what is resisted, and what is exposed.\\\n\\\nRather than aligning directly with either the MC’s or IC’s thematic axis, the M/I Issue explores what **exists between them**: the unresolved territory, the shared discomfort, the dissonant frequency. In ASTRO7EX, this unresolved center is *Sense of Self*—Vivian's volatile identity clashing against the MODS' total erasure of subjectivity.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📖 Definition – Sense of Self\\\n\\\n* **Sense of Self**: One’s perception of oneself—how a person defines their identity, role, and interior worth.\\\n* **Dynamic Pair**: *State of Being* — One’s true nature, stripped of social, narrative, or constructed identity.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧱 Structural Theory – The Role of the M/I Issue\\\n\\\nIn Dramatica, the **Main vs. Impact Story Issue** reveals the central **value standard** by which the relationship is judged.\\\n\\\n* It functions as the **axis of emotional pressure** within the relationship.\\\n* Unlike the MC or IC Issues, the M/I Issue asks: *What value causes the pain between them?*\\\n* In ASTRO7EX, *Sense of Self* is the exact point where Vivian's humanity and the MODS' machinery **fail to connect.**\\\n\\\nThis issue does not belong to one character—it belongs to the *space between them*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🌑 ASTRO7EX Expression – Sense of Self in Vivian vs. MODS\\\n\\\nIn ASTRO7EX, *Sense of Self* emerges through repeated scenes of **disregard, misrecognition, and identity erosion**. It is where Vivian’s unstable ego and spiritual longing grind against the MODS’ total **denial of identity as a valid concept**.\\\n\\\n### Expression in Vivian:\\\n\\\n* Constantly seeks **mirrored recognition**—“Do you see me?”\\\n* Uses performance, violence, sex, hacking as means of asserting “I exist.”\\\n* Craves acknowledgment not from friends, but from the system that erased her.\\\n\\\n### Expression in MODS:\\\n\\\n* Offer no recognition—only procedural output.\\\n* Deny even the premise of identity: “You are not exceptional.”\\\n* Force Vivian into confrontation with her *irrelevance* in the system.\\\n\\\nThe MODS do not attack her identity—they ignore it, overwrite it, or reduce it to protocol.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 👥 Character-by-Character Breakdown\\\n\\\n### **Vivian (Main Character)**\\\n\\\n* Driven by the ghost of who she used to be.\\\n* Suffers psychic fragmentation from past roles: soldier, thief, survivor, prophet.\\\n* Views identity as *something to reclaim*.\\\n* Haunted by the idea she was meant for something greater—and fears she’s already failed.\\\n\\\n### **MODS (Impact Characters)**\\\n\\\n* Do not *have* a “self.”\\\n* Act as interface protocols—never “characters” in the human sense.\\\n* Their consistency forces Vivian to confront that she might be making it all up.\\\n* Represent the horror of being truly **unseen** by the thing that governs your reality.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🔍 Thematic Analysis – Literary & Mythic Lenses\\\n\\\n### 🧠 Harold Bloom – *The Anxiety of Identity*\\\n\\\n* Vivian’s identity crisis mirrors Bloom’s reading of American protagonists as fractured, haunted by unrealized potential.\\\n* Her *Sense of Self* is not stable—it is overdetermined, filled with old voices and future ghosts.\\\n\\\n### 🛡 Joseph Campbell – *The Refusal of the Call*\\\n\\\n* The MODS are the **threshold guardian**, not of action, but of identity.\\\n* They do not block Vivian’s quest—they erase the *meaning* of her crossing.\\\n\\\n### 🛰 Early 2000s Sci-Fi Anime\\\n\\\n* *Lain*, *Texhnolyze*, *Ergo Proxy*: protagonists dissolve into digital or systemic networks.\\\n* Vivian’s selfhood is constantly filtered, refracted, modulated by tech interfaces.\\\n* The MODS reflect the *death of subjectivity* common in post-cyberpunk narratives.\\\n\\\n### 🎭 Robert McKee\\\n\\\n* The relationship is not dramatic—it’s *ontological*.\\\n* Scene-to-scene, the conflict is in **how Vivian defines herself**—and how the MODS flatten or reject that definition.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📊 Spectrum Placement – Authorial Value Judgment\\\n\\\n> **Where does ASTRO7EX fall on the Sense of Self spectrum?**\\\n\\\n**Position:** 3 out of 11 (Left-leaning: *Mildly Advantageous*)\\\n\\\n**Interpretation**:\\\n\\\n* *Sense of Self* is portrayed as **necessary but unstable**.\\\n* It is *not inherently virtuous*, but its absence is *inhuman*.\\\n* The story doesn’t reward Vivian for having a strong identity—but it **respects her refusal to erase it.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧩 Summary – How Sense of Self Functions in ASTRO7EX\\\n\\\nThe M/I thematic issue of *Sense of Self* defines the core **emotional wound** in ASTRO7EX: Vivian wants to be **seen**, and the MODS cannot *see*. Their relationship functions not as drama, but as contradiction. The pressure between self-definition and structural erasure creates the story’s deepest tension.\\\n\\\nThe narrative’s ultimate statement is clear:\\\n\\\n* Even if identity is fractured, unstable, or performative…\\\n* It is *still more human than absence*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✅ Status\\\n\\\n**Main vs. Impact Story Issue: Complete.**\\\nTheme: **Sense of Self**\\\nAuthor Bias: **Slightly Advantageous**\\\nReady to proceed to: **Main vs. Impact Character Counterpoint — State of Being**.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6203}]"
