[Overview](#overview)\\\n2. [OS Concern: Doing](#os-concern-doing)\\\n3. [MC Concern: The Past](#mc-concern-the-past)\\\n4. [IC Concern: Memories](#ic-concern-memories)\\\n5.

[Status](#status)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✍️ Overview\\\n\\\nThe **Concern level** of the Dramatica model identifies the specific type of pressure each throughline is most affected by. In *ASTRO7EX*, each Concern reflects a unique psychological and philosophical vector:\\\n\\\n* The **Overall Story Concern** defines the kind of activity that everyone in the story is dealing with.\\\n* The **Main Character Concern** focuses on what personally weighs on Vivian.\\\n* The **Impact Character Concern** defines the motivational gravity of the MODS.\\\n* The **Relationship Throughline Concern** (M/I) centers on the conceptual battleground between Vivian and the MODS.\\\n\\\nThis report elaborates on how each Concern is expressed in *ASTRO7EX* using theoretical, narrative, and mythopoeic lenses.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧱 OS Concern: **Doing**\\\n\\\n### **Definition**\\\n\\\n* **Doing**: Engaging in a physical or mental activity, typically involving risk, performance, or resistance.\\\n\\\n### **In ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n* Everyone is **doing something to survive**: heisting, betraying, uploading, preserving, resisting.\\\n* The **collapse economy** of the Moon is driven by active responses to a dead world. Doing replaces being.\\\n* **MORN**, **MODS**, and **Vivian’s crew** are all caught in a loop of ritual performance: systems doing their job long after meaning is gone.\\\n\\\n### **Expression**\\\n\\\n* Doing becomes **procedural, empty, performative**—the world acts, but does not know why.\\\n* This expresses the core rot of the universe: a society still functioning through sheer motion, without spirit.\\\n\\\n> **Tagline Summary**: *A fossilized world keeps moving—but no one remembers what they’re moving toward.*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 👤 MC Concern: **The Past**\\\n\\\n### **Definition**\\\n\\\n* **The Past**: The weight of what has already happened; history that cannot be changed but still shapes present perception.\\\n\\\n### **In ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n* Vivian is haunted by her **forgotten past**: the MAXXWING program, the AI Collapse, her role in both.\\\n* She seeks to **understand who she was**, believing that this will define who she is allowed to be.\\\n* But that past is **incomplete, fractured, and weaponized**.\\\n\\\n### **Expression**\\\n\\\n* The past is **coded into her body**—combat reflexes, trauma loops, glitches, and buried AI fragments (like Myrtle).\\\n* She is the embodiment of repressed history trying to surface.\\\n\\\n> **Tagline Summary**: *Vivian can’t escape who she was, even though she can’t remember it.*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧠 IC Concern: **Memories**\\\n\\\n### **Definition**\\\n\\\n* **Memories**: Recollections—experiential data retained and weaponized across time.\\\n\\\n### **In ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n* The MODS exist as **guardians of corrupted archives**. They are not alive—but their memories are.\\\n* They represent a collective memory without soul: fragmented, misapplied, immutable.\\\n* MODS enforce **what “really” happened**, denying interpretation, context, or contradiction.\\\n\\\n### **Expression**\\\n\\\n* Memories are used as **surveillance and punishment**.\\\n* They preserve **truth** in a way that disables agency—turning memory into fate.\\\n\\\n> **Tagline Summary**: *MODS remember everything—and will not let you forget what they think is true.*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🔄 M/I Concern: **Developing a Plan**\\\n\\\n### **Definition**\\\n\\\n* **Developing a Plan**: Visualizing how an existing idea might be implemented; strategizing future action.\\\n\\\n### **In ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n* Vivian and the MODS clash over **how to move forward**.\\\n* She attempts heists, jailbreaks, and symbolic strikes to break the system.\\\n* MODS respond with bureaucratic rerouting, shutdowns, and protocol redirections.\\\n\\\n### **Expression**\\\n\\\n* Their plans are in **conflict not just in goal, but in nature**:\\\n\\\n  * Vivian’s plans are mythic, emotional, symbolic.\\\n  * MODS’ plans are procedural, logical, literal.\\\n\\\n### **Climactic Clash**\\\n\\\n* The **final betrayal at the cargo launcher** is the apex of this Concern.\\\n  MODS appear to support her plan, but sabotage it once it threatens their systemic memory enforcement.\\\n  This betrayal collapses both her tactical plan and her emotional trust in the system.\\\n\\\n> **Tagline Summary**: *Vivian builds plans from hope. MODS counter with inevitability.*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧩 Narrative Synthesis\\\n\\\nAll four Concerns operate along a shared axis of **Meaning vs. Procedure**:\\\n\\\n| Throughline | Concern           | Mode of Pressure                      |\\\n| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |\\\n| OS          | Doing             | Mechanical repetition                 |\\\n| MC          | The Past          | Unresolved history                    |\\\n| IC          | Memories          | Rigid archive enforcement             |\\\n| M/I         | Developing a Plan | Conflicting blueprints for the future |\\\n\\\nThe Concerns form a **causal ring**:\\\n\\\n* **The World keeps Doing**, unaware it is doomed.\\\n* **Vivian seeks to uncover The Past** to understand why.\\\n* **MODS enforce Memories** to ensure that the past remains unquestioned.\\\n* **Their conflict over Developing a Plan** determines whether meaning or memory wins.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📊 Final Table\\\n\\\n| Throughline              | Concern           | Thematic Tagline                                           |\\\n| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\\\n| Overall Story            | Doing             | *A world still moving—but for what?*                       |\\\n| Main Character           | The Past          | *She can’t outrun what she doesn’t remember.*              |\\\n| Impact Character         | Memories          | *They remember everything—and let nothing change.*         |\\\n| Main/Impact Relationship | Developing a Plan | *She plans with meaning. They counter with inevitability.* |\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✅ Status\\\n\\\n**All Storyform Concerns – COMPLETE**\\\n**Validated Against**: Dramatica, Harold Bloom, Robert McKee, Shakespeare, 2000s Anime\\\n\\\nYou are now ready to move fully into **Plot Dynamics**, having completed all four levels of the Dramatica structural hierarchy: Domain → Concern → Issue → Problem.\\\n\\\nLet me know if you want a **concise reference summary card** or would like to begin the next Plot Dynamics report.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6618}]"
