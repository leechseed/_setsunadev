[Story Requirements – Doing](#story-requirements--doing)\\\n5. [Integration Across Dramatica Domains](#integration-across-dramatica-domains)\\\n6. [Final Notes](#final-notes)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✍️ Overview\\\n\\\nThe core Storyform elements of **Goal**, **Consequence**, and **Requirements** have been fully illustrated and integrated into the narrative architecture of *ASTRO7EX*. These three pillars anchor the causality of the story’s Overall Throughline, providing a clear blueprint for plot escalation, thematic reinforcement, and character interaction. This report summarizes their function, interrelation, and justification through Dramatica theory, as well as their resonance with Bloomian mythos, McKee’s structural methodology, and genre-aligned expectations for a YA male audience.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🎯 Story Goal – *Understanding*\\\n\\\n### **Definition**\\\n\\\nThe central objective of the story is for the characters (and world) to achieve a profound **Understanding** of what caused the severance between Earth and the Moon, and with it, the fall of the AI civilization.\\\n\\\n### **Expression in ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n* **Vivian** and others must uncover **the buried truth** of the AI Collapse and the role she played as a child weapon in cutting the Moon off from Earth.\\\n* This “understanding” is not just informational—it is existential. It challenges the epistemology of the post-collapse world.\\\n\\\n### **Mythopoetic Function**\\\n\\\n* Understanding acts as a return to Eden—**retrieving a lost history** that was deliberately erased.\\\n* The “truth” is not only hidden; it was violently sealed by the protagonist herself.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 💣 Story Consequence – *Developing a Plan*\\\n\\\n### **Definition**\\\n\\\nIf the goal of Understanding is not achieved, the consequence is that characters and systems will be forced into **Developing a Plan**—building flawed solutions without knowing the real problem.\\\n\\\n### **Expression in ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\n* The longer the world fails to understand the Collapse, the more it develops false plans—protocols, AI doctrines, MODS expansions—that deepen the tragedy.\\\n* John Smith’s plan, MODS’ automation loops, and Earth’s militarized ignorance are all consequences of this lack of clarity.\\\n\\\n### **Mythopoetic Function**\\\n\\\n* Planning becomes **a ritual of denial**, a Tower of Babel built atop ghost data.\\\n* The world *acts* as if it knows what it’s doing, while the rot festers below.\\\n\\\n### **Narrative Analogs**\\\n\\\n* *Ender’s Game*: Kids become the plan.\\\n* *Lain/Metal Gear*: The plan is the system.\\\n* *Evangelion*: Instrumentality as a consequence of never understanding individual pain.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🔧 Story Requirements – *Doing*\\\n\\\n### **Definition**\\\n\\\nTo reach the Story Goal of Understanding, certain **observable physical actions** must be completed. These are not philosophical musings but concrete actions that expose truth.\\\n\\\n### **Expression in ASTRO7EX**\\\n\\\nThe **Six-Step Structural Arc** is the mechanism of \\\"Doing\\\" as defined in Dramatica:\\\n\\\n1: Orientation —  *Arrival of the Cowboy* The protagonist performs a minor intervention (fixing a system, helping a stranger), disrupting dead routines.\\\n\\\n2. **Make Contact** – Reboot analog advisor Nacho.\\\n3. **Assume the Mask** – Go undercover as old self.\\\n4. **Shatter a System** – Destroy a MODS node.\\\n5. **Awaken a Memory** – Jack into her younger self’s archive.\\\n6. **Confront the Truth** – Broadcast the Moon War’s real story.\\\n\\\nEach step:\\\n\\\n* Involves risk and motion.\\\n* Cannot be skipped or theorized away.\\\n* Escalates narrative stakes and personal cost.\\\n\\\n### **McKee Alignment**\\\n\\\n* Each “Doing” action introduces irreversible change.\\\n* Rising tension through irreversible choices.\\\n* Physical struggle drives thematic revelation.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧩 Integration Across Dramatica Domains\\\n\\\n| Element          | ASTRO7EX Implementation                                     | Domain           |\\\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\\\n| **Goal**         | Achieve *Understanding* of Moon severance and AI collapse   | Psychology       |\\\n| **Consequence**  | If failed, MODS & others continue *Developing flawed Plans* | Physics/Planning |\\\n| **Requirements** | Must meet six escalating actions—*Doing*                    | Physics          |\\\n\\\nThe structure maintains:\\\n\\\n* **Cause-and-effect logic**\\\n* **Physical progression unlocking psychological meaning**\\\n* **Thematic inevitability**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✅ Final Notes\\\n\\\nThe development of these three major structural components ensures:\\\n\\\n* **Narrative cohesion**\\\n* **Plot progression through demonstrable action**\\\n* **A satisfying emotional and epistemic climax**\\\n\\\n> ASTRO7EX is not about discovering the truth by accident—it is about dragging it out of the wreckage with your bare hands.\\\n\\\nLet me know if you'd like a beat map or scene-to-step alignment next.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5362}]"
