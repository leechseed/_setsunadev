## Terminology Primer (Read First)

- **Value** ‚Üí How light or dark something is (independent of color).  
- **Value Contrast** ‚Üí The *difference in value* between adjacent shapes. The biggest value jump grabs the eye first.  
- **Edge** ‚Üí The transition between two shapes/values/colors.  
- **Edge Sharpness** ‚Üí How quickly that transition happens. Razor-sharp edges command attention; soft edges recede.  
- **Micro-contrast** ‚Üí Small, local value differences (pores, fabric texture). Adds ‚Äúcrunch.‚Äù  
- **Macro-contrast** ‚Üí Big, global value differences (subject vs background). Defines the overall read.  
- **Saturation** ‚Üí Color intensity. Highly saturated areas pull attention‚Äîuse sparingly near the focal.  
- **Color Temperature** ‚Üí Warm (reds/oranges) vs cool (blues/cyans). Warm advances, cool recedes (generally).  
- **Visual Weight** ‚Üí How strongly something attracts attention (size, value contrast, saturation, detail, warm hue, faces/text, sharpness).  
- **Negative Space** ‚Üí The ‚Äúempty‚Äù area around subjects. Used to isolate and clarify.  
- **Figure‚ÄìGround** ‚Üí Clear separation of subject (figure) from background (ground).  
- **Notan** ‚Üí Simplified design reduced to 2‚Äì3 flat values (black/gray/white) to check readability.  
- **Kissing Tangent** ‚Üí Edges barely touch or align awkwardly; flattens depth and creates confusion.  
- **Occlusion** ‚Üí Intentional overlap; one object blocks another to show depth.  
- **Leading Lines** ‚Üí Lines (real or implied) that steer the eye toward the subject.  
- **Rim Light** ‚Üí Thin highlight on an edge that separates a form from its background.  
- **Silhouette** ‚Üí The readable outer shape of a subject; must be clear for instant recognition.

> If a term appears below that isn‚Äôt in this primer, it will be defined in the **Extended Glossary**.

## How to Use This Guide
- **Pick one** weak area to improve per piece (e.g., ‚Äúthis week = Values‚Äù).  
- **Work top-down**: Macro (Hierarchy, Contrast) ‚Üí Meso (Balance, Flow) ‚Üí Micro (Edges, Texture).  
- **Test constantly**: Flip, Squint, Blur, and 3-Value Notan while composing‚Äînot after.

## The 8 Core Principles

### 3.1 Hierarchy
**Definition**  
Deliberate ordering of attention: **Primary ‚Üí Secondary ‚Üí Tertiary**. One clear winner first.

**Controls**  
Clarity, speed of read, narrative priority.

**Symptoms of failure**  
- ‚ÄúEverything is loud.‚Äù  
- Viewers ask ‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to look at?‚Äù

**Design methods**  
- **Crown the hero**: Give the focal area the largest **value contrast** *and* the **sharpest edges**.  
- **Demote competitors**: Reduce saturation/detail/edge sharpness away from the focal.  
- **Scale steps**: Use distinct size ratios (e.g., 1.0 ‚Üí 0.6 ‚Üí 0.35).  
- **Isolation**: Carve **negative space** around the hero.

**Quick fixes**  
- Add a light-on-dark or dark-on-light junction at the hero.  
- Soften/blur competing areas by 20‚Äì50%.  
- Pull a subtle vignette to mute the periphery.

**Context**
- *Photo/Film*: Key + rim on subject; background one stop flatter.  
- *Illustration*: Brightest accent and sharpest edge live at the eyes/hands.  
- *UI*: Single primary CTA; all others clearly secondary.

**Checklist**  
- Can a stranger name the subject in 1 second? If not, reassign value/edge priority.

---

### 3.2 Balance
**Definition**  
Distribution of **visual weight**. Two modes: **Symmetry** (calm) vs **Asymmetry** (dynamic).

**Controls**  
Mood (stable vs energetic), comfort vs tension.

**Symptoms of failure**  
- Frame feels lopsided; eye slides out on the heavy side.  
- Unintended tilt.

**Design methods**  
- **Symmetry**: Center, level, clean verticals/horizons; embrace monumental calm.  
- **Asymmetry**: Counter a **big dull mass** with a **small high-contrast accent**.  
- Keep heavy stuff off the extreme edges unless you *want* tension.

**Quick fixes**  
- Crop or nudge masses toward equilibrium; add a bright counterweight.  
- Straighten horizons/verticals.

**Context**
- *Architecture*: Dead-center fa√ßade, axes aligned.  
- *Street*: Large shadow block balanced by small lit figure.  
- *Poster*: Massive character balanced by small bright title block.

**Checklist**  
- Squint: do left/right (or top/bottom) halves feel intentional?

---

### 3.3 Contrast
**Definition**  
Differences that hook attention: **Value (king)** ‚Üí **Edge** ‚Üí **Color** ‚Üí **Detail**.

**Controls**  
First read, separation, drama.

**Symptoms of failure**  
- Muddy midtones everywhere; subject merges with background.  
- ‚ÄúFlat‚Äù image even with good color.

**Design methods**  
- Place the hero at the **highest value contrast** in the frame.  
- **Edge strategy**: Sharp where you want attention, soft elsewhere.  
- Reserve **saturation** and **micro-contrast** for the focal; keep background simple.

**Quick fixes**  
- Toggle grayscale; fix value design before color.  
- Add rim light or dark halo to clarify **silhouette** (avoid glowing outlines).  
- Drop background contrast locally around the hero.

**Context**
- *Product*: Specular edges define form; backdrop matte and neutral.  
- *Concept art*: Fog the distance (low contrast), punch the subject (high contrast).

**Checklist**  
- Blur to 10‚Äì20 px: does the focal still pop? If no, rework values.

---

### 3.4 Unity vs Variety
**Definition**  
Cohesion (**unity**) with controlled differences (**variety**) so the image isn‚Äôt boring or chaotic.

**Controls**  
Coherence, style signature, ease of parsing.

**Symptoms of failure**  
- All parts different ‚Üí noise.  
- All parts same ‚Üí monotony.

**Design methods**  
- Choose a **dominant family** (value range, hue range, shape language).  
- Add **2‚Äì3 deliberate variations** near the focal (accent hue, unique texture, shape break).  
- Use repetition-with-variation: echo motifs at smaller scales.

**Quick fixes**  
- Reduce hue spread; stick to one temperature family.  
- Add a single accent (color/shape) at the focal; remove extras elsewhere.

**Context**
- *Landscape*: Cool unity with a warm sunlit accent.  
- *UI*: One typeface family; hierarchy via size/weight, not random fonts.

**Checklist**  
- Summarize the piece‚Äôs ‚Äúfamily‚Äù in one sentence; if you can‚Äôt, unify.

---

### 3.5 Movement / Flow
**Definition**  
The **path the eye travels** via lines, curves, light, and beats.

**Controls**  
Pacing, narrative order, emotional feel (grace vs attack).

**Symptoms of failure**  
- Eye exits the frame fast; key beats get skipped; dead ends.

**Design methods**  
- **Leading lines** toward the hero (roads, gazes, arms, props).  
- **S-curves/diagonals** for grace/energy; avoid parallel monotony.  
- Place **stepping stones** (secondary beats) that march toward the focal.

**Quick fixes**  
- Add dark/light blockers at exit edges; bend lines back inward.  
- Rotate/repose figures and props to point to the hero.

**Context**
- *Comics*: Z-pattern guides panel order; balloons reinforce flow.  
- *Photography*: Shoreline arcs to lighthouse; clouds echo direction.

**Checklist**  
- Trace the eye with your finger: does it land on the hero and loop back?

---

### 3.6 Emphasis
**Definition**  
Stacking multiple cues at one spot to create **punch** (value, edge, color, detail, isolation).

**Controls**  
Impact, memorability, message priority.

**Symptoms of failure**  
- ‚ÄúNice, but nothing stands out.‚Äù  
- Background steals the show.

**Design methods**  
- **Stack signals** at the focal: sharpest edge + biggest value jump + richest micro-contrast.  
- **Isolate** the subject with negative space; simplify the surround.  
- Use **unique color** (only saturated warm in a sea of cool neutrals).

**Quick fixes**  
- Remove micro-contrast from non-essentials.  
- Add a small specular/edge accent on the subject; mute nearby areas.

**Context**
- *Poster*: One saturated accent on a desaturated scene.  
- *Portrait*: Catchlights and crisp lashes; hair/background softened.

**Checklist**  
- Reduce to a 3-value Notan: does emphasis still read? If not, re-stage.

---

### 3.7 Rhythm / Repetition
**Definition**  
Pattern and cadence from repeated shapes/intervals with **variation**.

**Controls**  
Cohesion, visual ‚Äúbeat,‚Äù forward motion.

**Symptoms of failure**  
- Even, mechanical spacing; or chaotic clustering with no cadence.

**Design methods**  
- Establish a **motif** (arches, triangles, circles). Repeat at smaller scales.  
- Use **progression** (big ‚Üí medium ‚Üí small) and **irregular spacing** to feel natural.  
- Align beats with flow so rhythm pushes toward the focal.

**Quick fixes**  
- Break perfect symmetry in the pattern; drop or shift one element.  
- Remove one beat where spacing is too even.

**Context**
- *Architecture*: Colonnade rhythm funnels into doorway focal.  
- *Landscape*: Fence posts diminishing into distance as tempo makers.

**Checklist**  
- Can you ‚Äútap‚Äù the cadence that accelerates toward the subject? If not, adjust spacing.

---

### 3.8 Depth
**Definition**  
Illusion of space via planes, overlap, scale, perspective, atmosphere, and light.

**Controls**  
Immersion, realism, subject separation.

**Symptoms of failure**  
- Flat scene; **kissing tangents**; subject blends with background.

**Design methods**  
- Always aim for **Foreground / Midground / Background**.  
- **Occlusion**: overlap shapes cleanly; avoid edge-kisses.  
- **Atmospheric perspective**: distance = lighter, lower contrast, lower saturation.  
- **Lighting**: Rim light separates; shadow mass unifies; keep a readable **silhouette**.

**Quick fixes**  
- Add a foreground silhouette or subtle vignette to create a near plane.  
- Lift background blacks and desaturate by 10‚Äì30% to push it back.

**Context**
- *Film*: Haze + backlights for layers; extras as mid-plane texture.  
- *Concept art*: Big foreground frame ‚Üí mid action ‚Üí distant landmark.

**Checklist**  
- Can you label 3 planes instantly? If not, add overlap or value stepping.

## Cross-Principle Triage (Fix Any Image in 60‚Äì90s)

1. **Hierarchy** ‚Üí Boost value/edge at hero; demote competitors.  
2. **Contrast** ‚Üí Check in grayscale; put the biggest value jump at the focal.  
3. **Flow** ‚Üí Turn lines inward; add exit blockers.  
4. **Balance** ‚Üí Add/relocate a counterweight; straighten tilt.  
5. **Depth** ‚Üí Add foreground layer; push background with atmosphere.  
6. **Unity/Variety** ‚Üí Commit to one palette/shape family; permit one accent.  
7. **Emphasis** ‚Üí Stack cues (value, edge, detail) only at the hero.  
8. **Rhythm** ‚Üí Break even spacing; step sizes toward focal.

---

## Diagnostic Tests & Tools

- **Squint Test** ‚Üí Reduces detail; checks **value** hierarchy quickly.  
- **Grayscale Toggle** ‚Üí If the read dies in gray, color was doing the heavy lifting (bad sign).  
- **Blur Test (10‚Äì20 px)** ‚Üí Ensures macro-read and focal survive without edges.  
- **Flip Test (horizontal)** ‚Üí Reveals balance issues, tangents, awkward angles.  
- **3-Value Notan** ‚Üí Force design into black/gray/white; fix readability there first.  
- **Edge Audit** ‚Üí Mark the 5 sharpest edges; they should cluster at/near the focal.

---

## Exercises That Build Skill Fast

1. **Daily Thumbnails** (10‚Äì20, 2 min each) ‚Üí Explore Hierarchy/Flow before detail.  
2. **Notan Studies** (3 values) ‚Üí From refs and masters; value design first.  
3. **Tangent Hunt** ‚Üí Print; circle every kissing tangent; redraw to overlap or separate.  
4. **One-Focal Drill** ‚Üí Make 3 comps where the focal is undeniable in 1 sec.  
5. **Edge Control** ‚Üí Paint with only soft edges; then add 10 hard edges exactly where needed.  
6. **Atmosphere Ramps** ‚Üí Practice pushing backgrounds back with value/saturation steps.  
7. **Rhythm Lines** ‚Üí Lay beats that accelerate toward focal; adjust spacing until it ‚Äútaps.‚Äù

## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)

- **Golden-ratio worship** ‚Üí It‚Äôs a tool, not a religion. Cure: prioritize value design.  
- **Centering by habit** ‚Üí Boredom. Cure: thirds/triangles/diagonals with intent.  
- **Midtone soup** ‚Üí No value hierarchy. Cure: push lights/darks; define a Notan.  
- **Kissing tangents** ‚Üí Flatness. Cure: occlude or separate decisively.  
- **Busy backgrounds** ‚Üí Focal lost. Cure: desaturate/soften/simplify background.  
- **Edge noise** ‚Üí Random crispness. Cure: hard edges only at focal, soft elsewhere.

---

## Mini-Process: Compose on Purpose

1. **Intent** ‚Üí Write the sentence: *‚ÄúThe viewer must see ____ first.‚Äù*  
2. **Choose an armature** ‚Üí Thirds, triangle, diagonal, or spiral‚Äîjust one.  
3. **Notan** ‚Üí Lock the 3-value design.  
4. **Place the focal** ‚Üí Highest value contrast + sharpest edges live here.  
5. **Flow** ‚Üí Lay leading lines/stepping stones toward the focal.  
6. **Balance** ‚Üí Add counterweight; avoid edge heaviness.  
7. **Depth** ‚Üí Fore/Mid/Back with atmosphere and occlusion.  
8. **Edge & Color pass** ‚Üí Hardness and saturation concentrated at the focal.  
9. **Diagnostics** ‚Üí Squint, grayscale, blur, flip. Fix what fails.  
10. **Polish** ‚Üí Micro-contrast only where the eye should linger.

## Extended Glossary

- **Accent (Color/Value)** ‚Üí Localized spike in saturation or brightness to attract attention.  
- **Ambient Occlusion (Art shorthand)** ‚Üí Soft darkening where forms meet; increases depth.  
- **Atmospheric Perspective** ‚Üí Distant objects lose contrast/saturation and shift cooler/lighter.  
- **Background Compression** ‚Üí Making background values cluster together to reduce noise.  
- **Counterweight** ‚Üí A small but potent element (usually higher contrast/saturation) balancing a large mass.  
- **Detail Hierarchy** ‚Üí Highest texture near focal; simplified elsewhere.  
- **Dominant Family** ‚Üí The prevailing value range, hue range, or shape language that unifies a piece.  
- **Edge (Hard/Soft/Lost)** ‚Üí Hard = abrupt; Soft = gradual; Lost = edge disappears into neighbor value.  
- **Focal (Focal Area)** ‚Üí The intended first stop of the viewer‚Äôs eye.  
- **Gesture (Visual)** ‚Üí Overall directional thrust of forms/figures.  
- **Haloing (Bad)** ‚Üí Unnatural outline glow around subject; avoid except for subtle separation.  
- **Local Value** ‚Üí Subject‚Äôs inherent value independent of light (e.g., black coat vs white shirt).  
- **Negative Space (Active)** ‚Üí Intentional emptiness shaping the subject and controlling rhythm.  
- **Occlusion** ‚Üí Overlap creating depth; the front form ‚Äúoccludes‚Äù the back.  
- **Pictorial Depth** ‚Üí The 2D illusion of 3D space using planes, perspective, and atmosphere.  
- **Silhouette** ‚Üí Recognizable outer contour; readability skyrockets with a clean silhouette.  
- **Specular Highlight** ‚Üí Bright reflection on glossy surfaces; potent emphasis tool.  
- **Stepping Stones** ‚Üí Secondary accents/beats arranged to lead to the focal.  
- **Tangent (Kissing)** ‚Üí Two shapes/lines meet awkwardly; kills depth‚Äîseparate or overlap.  
- **Value Key** ‚Üí Overall value ‚Äúmood‚Äù (high-key = light, low-key = dark, mid-key = midtones).  
- **Vignette** ‚Üí Subtle edge darkening or softening to keep attention inside the frame.  
- **Visual Weight** ‚Üí The combined pull of size, contrast, saturation, detail, warm hue, faces/text, sharpness.
