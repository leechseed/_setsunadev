Meadows  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-1603580557\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Stocks and Flows**: outcomes come from accumulations + rates of change, governed by feedback and delays.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Stocks** (accumulations): tension, trust, capital, legitimacy, fear, institutional power\\\n- **Flows** (rates): recruitment, decay, escalation, attrition, propaganda spread, resource burn\\\n- **Feedback loops**:\\\n  - **Reinforcing** (snowball): “power → enforcement → fear → compliance → more power”\\\n  - **Balancing** (stabilizing): “cost → resistance → reform → lower cost”\\\n- **Delays**: causes and effects are separated in time, so you misattribute why things happen\\\n- **Leverage points**: small changes with huge effects (rules, information, goals, paradigms)\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nReality (and story-worlds) are governed by **feedback + delay**, not linear causality.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nBuild your IP as a system:\\\n- identify the **few** stocks that matter\\\n- locate the dominant loops\\\n- change the rules/information/goals instead of brute-forcing events\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Name 5–10 stocks (power, legitimacy, money, social cohesion, etc.)\\\n- For each stock: define inflows/outflows and what controls them\\\n- Identify 1 reinforcing loop and 1 balancing loop per major institution\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Before adding lore/plot: “What loop does this reinforce?”\\\n- When something feels implausible: find the missing stock, delay, or loop\\\n- When scale drift happens: enforce leverage points (rules/goals/paradigm) instead of patching scenes\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Systems Thinking Made Simple\\\n\\\n**Authors:** Derek Cabrera, Laura Cabrera  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-1948486026\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**DSRP (Mental Grammar)**: Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, Perspectives.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Distinctions**: what is this vs. what it is not (hard boundaries prevent mush)\\\n- **Systems**: parts/wholes (prevents “everything is everything” spaghetti)\\\n- **Relationships**: causal, enabling, constraining, identity (explicit links beat vibes)\\\n- **Perspectives**: stakeholder views, values, incentives (who believes what and why)\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nCoherence comes from **explicit structure**, not raw cleverness.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nUse DSRP as a **debugger**:\\\n- if you’re confused, one of D/S/R/P is missing or inconsistent\\\n- if the reader is confused, your distinctions or perspectives are underspecified\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Run “DSRP passes” on any messy concept:\\\n  - D: define it with a boundary\\\n  - S: list its parts and what whole it serves\\\n  - R: name 3 relationships that matter\\\n  - P: list 3 perspectives that disagree about it\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Keep a “DSRP checklist” for every new faction/system\\\n- Force yourself to write: “X is not Y because…”\\\n- Rotate viewpoint explicitly: “What does the villain call this? What does the public call this?”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### The Fifth Discipline\\\n\\\n**Author:** Peter M. Senge  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-0385517256\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Iceberg Model**: events → patterns → structures → mental models.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Systems archetypes**: recurring failure patterns (fixes that fail, shifting the burden, etc.)\\\n- **Mental models**: beliefs that generate structures that generate patterns\\\n- **Learning organization**: a system that improves itself without collapsing under complexity\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nSystems persist because **beliefs reproduce structures**.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nTo change outcomes, change:\\\n- how information flows\\\n- what people believe is “normal”\\\n- what the institution rewards/punishes\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Identify the “official story” vs. “operating story”\\\n- Track incentives: “What behavior gets rewarded?”\\\n- Diagnose archetypes: is your world stuck in “shifting the burden” (quick fixes vs. fundamental solution)?\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Build institutions with self-maintenance loops (rituals, bureaucracy, doctrine)\\\n- Show reforms failing unless beliefs/incentives change\\\n- Use “mental model collisions” as reliable conflict engines\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### The Sciences of the Artificial\\\n\\\n**Author:** Herbert A. Simon  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-0262537537\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Design as Science**: artificial systems are designed; study them by studying constraints, goals, and bounded rationality.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Bounded rationality**: agents satisfice, they don’t optimize\\\n- **Hierarchy**: complex systems are built from sub-systems (stackable design)\\\n- **Near-decomposability**: subsystems interact more internally than externally (this is why modularity works)\\\n- **Design constraints**: goals + limits define the shape of the system\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nYour IP is not “found.” It is **designed** under constraints—so treat it like an engineered artifact.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nArchitect the world:\\\n- define goals (what the system produces)\\\n- define constraints (what it cannot do)\\\n- define interfaces (how subsystems communicate)\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Write “design requirements” for institutions and magic/tech systems\\\n- Encode “satisficing” decisions: people choose the first acceptable move, not the best move\\\n- Break complexity into modules with clear interfaces\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Maintain a “design spec” for canon systems (inputs/outputs/constraints)\\\n- When inconsistencies appear, resolve them by revisiting constraints, not by lore patching\\\n- Treat every new addition as a change request against the spec\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## PSTO — Cognitive Modes and Decision Governance\\\n\\\n### Six Thinking Hats\\\n\\\n**Author:** Edward de Bono  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-0316178310\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Mode Switching**: separate thinking modes so they don’t sabotage each other.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **White**: facts / unknowns\\\n- **Red**: emotion / intuition signals\\\n- **Black**: risk / critique\\\n- **Yellow**: value / upside\\\n- **Green**: alternatives / creativity\\\n- **Blue**: process control / agenda\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nConfusion comes from **mixed modes**: critique during ideation kills output; ideation during decision kills closure.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nRun thinking in sequences:\\\n- diverge first (Green)\\\n- evaluate second (Black/Yellow)\\\n- decide third (Blue)\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Timebox each hat\\\n- Force “Blue hat” checkpoints: “What decision is being made right now?”\\\n- Separate “risk identification” from “risk response”\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Use hats as a meeting/writing-room protocol\\\n- Maintain a “decision log” so Blue-hat outcomes persist across sessions\\\n- Create a recurring “Black hat audit” for canon-breaking risks\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Thinking, Fast and Slow\\\n\\\n**Author:** Daniel Kahneman  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-0374533557\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Two Systems**: fast intuitive judgment vs. slow deliberate reasoning.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Heuristics and biases**: you will hallucinate causes, overfit patterns, and trust vibes\\\n- **Overconfidence**: especially lethal in canon decisions and “it’s obvious” story logic\\\n- **Availability**: you overuse what’s most vivid/recent instead of what’s structurally correct\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nIntuition is useful—but **unreliable under complexity and high stakes**.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nSlow down decisions that:\\\n- lock canon\\\n- set tone/theme/invariants\\\n- introduce new system rules\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Insert “slow-thinking gates” for irreversible decisions\\\n- Ask: “What evidence would prove this wrong?”\\\n- Beware “narrative fallacy”: coherent story ≠ true cause\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Create a short “bias checklist” for major story commits\\\n- Force counterfactual tests: “If this were false, what else would explain it?”\\\n- Do premortems before committing to big arcs/systems\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### How to Solve It\\\n\\\n**Author:** George Pólya  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-0691119663\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Problem-Solving Loop**: understand → plan → execute → review.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Heuristic questioning**: translate vague problems into solvable forms\\\n- **Related problems**: solve a simpler version first; then scale it back up\\\n- **Looking back**: extract method, not just result (so you can reuse it)\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nMost “creative block” is actually **problem definition failure**.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nTurn writing/design issues into explicit problem types:\\\n- contradiction\\\n- missing constraint\\\n- unclear objective\\\n- wrong scale\\\n- wrong model\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Rephrase the problem 3 different ways\\\n- Solve a reduced version (smaller cast, smaller stakes, shorter timeframe)\\\n- Use analogies and invariants as constraint tools\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Keep a “problem ledger” (problem → plan → result → reusable heuristic)\\\n- Convert frustration into a question (“What do I not understand yet?”)\\\n- Require a post-solve write-up: what did you learn that prevents recurrence?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## PSTO — Creative Convergence and Ideation Control\\\n\\\n### Creative Confidence\\\n\\\n**Authors:** Tom Kelley, David Kelley  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-0385349369\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Make to Learn**: confidence is built through action + feedback loops, not inspiration.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Self-efficacy**: the belief you can produce outcomes—critical for long-form IP\\\n- **Rapid prototyping**: reduce fear by shrinking the cost of being wrong\\\n- **Reframing**: treat problems as design prompts, not identity judgments\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nCreativity is not a trait; it’s **a repeatable practice under feedback**.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nBuild a pipeline that rewards shipping:\\\n- prototypes early\\\n- critique later\\\n- commit with evidence\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Prototype scenes, arcs, factions, UI, rules as cheap drafts\\\n- Use “small bets” rather than giant monolithic commitments\\\n- Replace debate with tests\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Maintain a prototype backlog\\\n- Set a “ship cadence” (weekly outputs)\\\n- Enforce “decision closure”: every cycle ends with commit/kill/defer-with-date\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### The Universal Traveler\\\n\\\n**Authors:** Don Koberg, Jim Bagnall  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-1560520450\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Soft-Systems Creativity Workbook**: structured prompts that force movement when you’re stuck.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Goal shaping**: clarify what “done” looks like\\\n- **Diverge/converge cycles**: deliberate expansion and narrowing\\\n- **Lateral prompts**: break fixation by forcing category shifts\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nForward motion requires **structured prompts**, not willpower.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nUse the Traveler when:\\\n- you need options fast\\\n- you’re stuck in one interpretation\\\n- you need to break a deadlock in design\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Run one cycle: generate 20 options, then reduce to 3 with criteria\\\n- Force weirdness: “Do the opposite,” “Change the medium,” “Invert the value”\\\n- Use constraint games to reveal hidden invariants\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Keep a “Traveler session” template for 30–60 minutes\\\n- Archive your option lists (they become future fuel)\\\n- Turn winning options into requirements (so they don’t evaporate)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Design Methods\\\n\\\n**Author:** John Chris Jones  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-0471284963\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Design as Method, Not Mood**: complex design needs explicit methods and staged process.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Divergence → Transformation → Convergence** (classic design process staging)\\\n- **Method selection**: different problems require different methods\\\n- **Complexity handling**: design fails when the method doesn’t match the problem class\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nMethod mismatch creates chaos: you can’t “brainstorm” your way through systems architecture.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nPick methods intentionally:\\\n- use divergent methods to map possibility space\\\n- use transformation methods to restructure\\\n- use convergent methods to decide and commit\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Maintain a “method menu” (which method for which problem)\\\n- Separate “explore the space” from “choose a solution”\\\n- Create decision criteria before you evaluate options\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Run your creative work like a design program with phases\\\n- Keep artifacts per phase (maps, criteria, prototypes, decisions)\\\n- Treat convergence as mandatory (or your project becomes a graveyard of fragments)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### Gamestorming\\\n\\\n**Authors:** Dave Gray, Sunni Brown, James Macanufo  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-0596804176\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Externalized Group Cognition**: put thinking on the wall so working memory stops choking.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Games as processes**: repeatable formats that generate outcomes\\\n- **Shared models**: alignment through visible structure\\\n- **Constraint-based play**: creativity improves when rules exist\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nComplex thinking improves when made **visible and manipulable**.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nUse games to:\\\n- align a team (even if the “team” is future-you)\\\n- generate options\\\n- force decisions with structure\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Use canvases and structured diagrams, not blank pages\\\n- Break problems into rounds: generate → cluster → name → vote → decide\\\n- Choose a game format based on what you need: ideas, alignment, or decision\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Keep a stable set of “default games” for your workflow\\\n- Archive boards (photos, docs) as canonical references\\\n- Treat diagrams as first-class production assets\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## PSTO — Narrative and Scale Cognition\\\n\\\n### Storythinking\\\n\\\n**Author:** Angus Fletcher  \\\n**ISBN:** 978-0231206938\\\n\\\n#### Mental Model\\\n**Narrative Intelligence**: story is a tool for managing complexity, prediction, cooperation, identity, and meaning across time.\\\n\\\n#### Core Constructs (Meat)\\\n- **Narrative as cognition**: story is a mental technology, not decoration\\\n- **Scale coherence**: micro-actions must carry macro-meaning (sentence → scene → arc → society)\\\n- **Patterned pressure**: repeated stress tests reveal values, not speeches\\\n\\\n#### Policy\\\nNarrative coherence comes from **consistent meaning under pressure**, not lore density.\\\n\\\n#### Strategy\\\nUse storythinking to keep scale legible:\\\n- build repeatable patterns (pressure → choice → cost)\\\n- keep choices aligned with your world’s system logic\\\n- ensure local wins don’t break global truth\\\n\\\n#### Tactics\\\n- Treat choices as tests of invariants (“does this violate the rule of gravity?”)\\\n- Use recurring pressures (money, legitimacy, fear, love, status) to create thematic consistency\\\n- Build “scale ladders”: one beat that echoes at multiple zoom levels\\\n\\\n#### Operations\\\n- Create a “scale checklist” for every major beat:\\\n  - does dialogue reflect world-truth?\\\n  - does the scene reinforce the dominant loops?\\\n  - does the arc pay a real cost?\\\n- Maintain a canon “meaning spec” (your invariants + what they forbid)\\\n- Audit for drift every 5–10 chapters/episodes\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Synthesis: Where PSTO Lives in Your Workflow\\\n\\\n### Your Current Stack (By Function)\\\n- **System Structure (How the
