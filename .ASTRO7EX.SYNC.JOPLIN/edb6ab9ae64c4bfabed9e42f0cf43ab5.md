# 🔧 REFRAMING: Overall Story Concern in ASTRO7EX

> Choose 1–2 (max 3) **Overall Concerns** that best define the shared existential battleground in ASTRO7EX:

**Valid options from the Situation/Activity Domain**:

* The Past
* How Things Are Changing
* The Present
* The Future
* Understanding
* Doing
* Obtaining
* Gathering Information

Let’s explore the strongest **blend** to reflect your vision.

---

## 🥇 PRIMARY CONCERN: **The Past**

> *The world is running on corrupted memory, falsified prophecy, and suppressed trauma.*

**Justification**:

* Vivian’s lobotomized comrades are still *alive but gone*.
* The Godking is not new—it is a fossil of techno-theocratic intent.
* The Mods still enforce rules no one understands.
* MORN is a privatized ghost church.
* Myrtle is a living flashback.

**Anime Precedent**:

* *Serial Experiments Lain*: identity built from cached data
* *Texhnolyze*: systems rot while pretending to function
* *Eva*: humanity’s worst traits loop through time like trauma cycles

**Harmonic Astrology**:

* Pluto + Saturn = **legacy pressure**
* Moon Pisces + Mercury Scorpio = **submerged emotional ruins**
* Capricorn = **institutional ossification**

🟢 **Lock this as Core Structural Concern**.

---

## 🥈 SECONDARY CONCERN: **Understanding**

> *The characters struggle not just to survive—but to comprehend what is real, what is lost, what is propaganda.*

**Why this matters**:

* The past isn’t just buried—it’s **scrambled**.
* The Committee gives *rational truth* that’s *disconnected from meaning*.
* John Smith believes prophecy is being fulfilled—but it’s just a Bitcoin wallet.
* Understanding is the *battleground for sanity*.

**Genre Tropes**:

* Post-2000s anime = info overload, data paranoia, epistemological collapse.
* *Ergo Proxy*: trying to understand what the system wants leads to madness
* *Paprika*: memory, selfhood, and “understanding” become indistinguishable

**American Framing (Bloom)**:

* The "American self" seeks personal salvation through **individual gnosis**, not communal revelation.
* Vivian doesn’t seek knowledge—she seeks **truth beneath propaganda**.

🟡 **Lock this as Thematic Deep Layer**.

---

## 🥉 OPTIONAL TERTIARY: **Doing**

> *Rebellion, sabotage, lobotomy raids, sex, survival—all kinetic reactions to the trap.*

**Supports Activity/Situation balance**:

* MODS block action.
* Nacho enables it.
* Fiona tempts against it.
* John Smith enforces *dogmatic* Doing.

This adds **tension to the surface**, while **The Past + Understanding** drive the core.

🟠 Use **Doing** as the **external manifestation** of internal dissonance.

## 📌 RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE FOR DOCUMENTATION

> **Overall Story Concern**:
> The characters of ASTRO7EX are trapped inside the **haunted memory** of a system that refuses to die.
> Their shared conflict revolves around a **warped understanding of what truly happened**, what was stolen, what was replaced, and how meaning can still be found within a rotting world.
> While the actions they take—**Doing**—are desperate and explosive, the real pressure comes from the **inability to change the past**, and the **terror of seeing the truth too clearly**.
