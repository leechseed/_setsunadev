## **Key Narrative Devices**

### ❓ Game Show as Narrative Frame (Countdown Engine)
- **Definition**: The *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?* quiz provides the structural skeleton.
- **Function**: Each question triggers a flashback that explains *how* he knows the answer.
- **Narrative Effect**: Tension builds with each question while the story unfolds backward through his trauma and survival.

### ⏳ Nonlinear Flashback Structure
- **Definition**: The story jumps between the present game show interrogation and past memories.
- **Function**: Reframes the protagonist’s life as a slow revelation of causality and fate.
- **Narrative Effect**: Juxtaposes past suffering with present reward, making knowledge feel hard-won and miraculous.

### 🧠 Knowledge Through Suffering (Karmic Structure)
- **Definition**: Jamal’s life experiences—love, abuse, crime, loss—accidentally teach him the answers.
- **Function**: Redefines intelligence as experience-based, not academic.
- **Narrative Effect**: Elevates street smarts and endurance as spiritual currency.

### 💔 Star-Crossed Romance
- **Definition**: Jamal’s lifelong love for Latika anchors the emotional core.
- **Function**: The game show isn't just about money—it’s about finding her again.
- **Narrative Effect**: Stakes are personal; victory = reunion.

### 🪢 Destiny vs Coincidence
- **Definition**: The plot constantly flirts with the question: *is this fate or just chance?*
- **Function**: Creates thematic tension between divine design and human agency.
- **Narrative Effect**: Elevates Jamal’s journey from survival story to mythic parable.

## **Structural Layers**
