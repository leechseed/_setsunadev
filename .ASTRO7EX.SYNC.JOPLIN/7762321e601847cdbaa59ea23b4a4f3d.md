## 🧠 Overview

Fiona’s interests are not casual hobbies; they are meticulously curated extensions of her worldview. Each preference reveals a facet of her internal logic: she is drawn to contradictions, ritualized aesthetics, and the intimacy of danger. Her dislikes reflect an instinctive recoil from clarity, moral absolutism, and any emotional state that demands unfiltered vulnerability. Her likes and dislikes operate as weapons and shields simultaneously, forming the psychological armor that supports her function as Contagonist in *ASTRO7EX*.

## 🎨 Core Aesthetic Interests

* **Perfume Chemistry**: Fiona collects and blends analog perfumes, preferring those with base notes that evoke decay and longing (oud, ambergris, smoldered sandalwood).
* **Ornamental Weapons**: Fascinated by blades, especially those designed more for ceremonial display than combat. Each represents an aesthetic of silent threat.
* **Broken Analog Tech**: Admires obsolete devices (VHS players, analog synths, defunct broadcast towers) as artifacts of forgotten intimacy and irreversible error.
* **Fetish Couture**: Passionate about avant-garde fashion that weaponizes the body—vinyl gloves, corsetry, sculptural silhouettes that restrict and entice simultaneously.

---

## 🧬 Psychological Likes

* **Ambiguity**: Loves situations where meaning remains unresolved, where silence speaks louder than confessions.
* **Emotional Echoes**: Drawn to people or moments that leave lasting affective residue rather than explicit narrative resolution.
* **Resistance in Others**: Enjoys engaging with strong-willed individuals who resist her influence, viewing it as an erotic and intellectual challenge.
* **Aesthetic Rituals**: Prefers activities framed as rituals—carefully staged tea ceremonies, slow dressing routines, or performance-based healing.

---

## 💥 Dislikes & Aversions

* **Literalism**: Detests direct, literal communication—she believes it desecrates the mystery of human interaction.
* **Predictability**: Repelled by those who function purely out of duty or pre-programmed moral conviction.
* **Monotony in Sensation**: Finds repetitive pleasure-seeking or pure hedonism without symbolic layering shallow and revolting.
* **Transparency**: Averse to emotional transparency; considers "raw vulnerability" without strategic framing to be a betrayal of personal power.

---

## 💌 Symbolic & Erotic Preferences

* **Pain as Metaphor**: Fascinated by pain not as punishment but as an erotic metaphor for presence and surrender. She dislikes pain that is blunt or sadistic for its own sake.
* **Submission as Theater**: Enjoys orchestrated submission (hers or others’) as performative acts rather than genuine power exchange.
* **Memory as Fetish**: Finds deep erotic charge in corrupted or unreliable memories; believes that recollection is more sensual than contact.
* **Silent Observers**: Prefers partners or audiences who watch rather than engage—her ideal is being a living installation rather than a participant in an equal exchange.

## ✅ Summary

Fiona’s likes and dislikes reflect a philosophy of **weaponized ambiguity** and **aesthetic control**. She prefers layered, symbolic experiences to direct emotional exposure, viewing life as a series of ritualized scenes rather than authentic moments. Her distaste for literalism and moral purity mirrors her core conflict with Vivian’s drive for meaning. Ultimately, Fiona’s interests shape her as a creature of performance, where every desire is staged and every rejection another layer of allure. Her narrative astrology reinforces these tendencies, presenting a cosmic architecture that mirrors and intensifies her interior logic.

## 🌀 Dramatica Summary (Paragraph Form)

In Dramatica terms, Fiona’s interests are direct extensions of her role as Contagonist: she embodies the narrative force of temptation, inviting the Main Character away from clear paths and into luxurious stasis. Her love of ambiguity, ritual, and emotional echo perfectly supports her thematic function as an obstacle to Vivian’s quest for clarity and transformation. Her aversion to literalism and transparency shows her deep alignment with stalling narrative progress—she thrives in subtext, misdirection, and sensual deferral. These interests solidify Fiona as the embodiment of seductive inertia, a living invitation to choose numbness over revelation.
