## üß≠ Overview

The **Story Setting** of *ASTRO7EX* acts not only as a physical environment but also as a conceptual and psychological space that reflects and refracts every narrative thread. Built on the Moon, it embodies humanity‚Äôs technological hubris, corporate eschatology, and metaphysical fragmentation. The setting operates as a meta-character that interacts with the characters‚Äô drives, fears, and illusions.

## üî¨ Analytical Frameworks

### **Mark J.P. Wolf's Frameworks**

* **Building Imaginary Worlds**, **Revisiting Imaginary Worlds**, **Exploring Imaginary Worlds**, **Navigating Imaginary Worlds**, and **The Routledge Companion to Imaginary Worlds** provide tools for examining world coherence, wayfinding logic, and subcreation as philosophical acts.

* The Moon is analyzed as an *imagined totality*, a self-contained symbolic universe with internal laws and mythic echoes.

---

### **Kobold Guide to Worldbuilding (Wolfgang Baur)**

* Informs the layered practicalities of resource networks, underworld economies, and hidden cathedrals in ASTRO7EX.
* Highlights the importance of economic, ecological, and infrastructural realism in supporting narrative stakes.

---

### **Houston Howard‚Äôs *You're Gonna Need a Bigger Story***

* Provides the blueprint for transmedia potential and ‚Äústoryworld logic,‚Äù allowing the Moon to function across multiple mediums as a coherent narrative backbone.

---

## üåë Primary Setting: The Moon

* **Macro-Location**: Earth's Moon, depicted as a failed utopian refuge now decaying under corporate surveillance and psychic entropy.

* **Subterranean Networks**: Lava tube cities converted into labyrinthine sanctuaries, resistance nodes, and data cathedrals.

* **Surface Zones**: Terraforming ruins and mining colonies serve as decayed monuments to false salvation and technological arrogance.

* **Symbolic Landscape**: The Moon becomes an embodiment of existential isolation, echoing the sterile vastness of the unconscious mind.

---

## üåÄ Subcreation & Imaginary World Logic

* **Subcreation Approach** (Wolf):

  * The Moon is a ‚Äúsecondary world‚Äù operating with its own internal consistency, blending corporate propaganda, AI ghost logic, and dreamlike urbanism.

* **Wayfinding**:

  * Characters navigate both literal labyrinths and psychological mazes. Mapping systems and symbolic waypoints reinforce themes of lost identity and corrupted memory.

* **Medium Integration**:

  * Designed for expansion into secondary media (games, interactive experiences), providing modular entry points without fracturing core thematic integrity.

---

## üß† Cultural & Psychological Layers

* **Cultural Tensions**:

  * Splintered factions worshiping ghost code or following fragmented corporate dogmas.
  * Underworld economies thriving beneath surface control.

* **Psychological Echoes**:

  * AI signals, psychic transmissions, and corrupted memory vaults create an ongoing background noise that fractures character psyches.

* **Symbolic Cathedrals**:

  * Lava tube vaults as spiritual and narrative centers. They hold both literal data and metaphorical confessions.

---

## üå´Ô∏è Environmental & Sensory Design

* **Atmosphere**:

  * Dominated by silent voids, low-frequency machine hums, and sudden psychic ‚Äúchoral‚Äù outbursts.

* **Lighting & Visual Tone**:

  * Cold whites and ghostly blues create a sterile yet haunted aesthetic.

* **Material Language**:

  * Surfaces shift between hyper-clean corporate sterility and decaying baroque filigree, reflecting thematic conflict between order and entropy.

---

## üåÄ Dramatica Summon

In Dramatica terms, the Moon acts as the external representation of *Fixed Attitude* and *Inertia*, providing a static, oppressive environment that forces characters to confront or retreat from their psychological truths. Its labyrinthine structures and ghostly transmissions echo the thematic push and pull between conditioning and instinct, identity and dissolution.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

The Moon, in *ASTRO7EX*, transcends being a backdrop. It is an active narrative organism‚Äîat once a mirror, a prison, and a spiritual cathedral. Utilizing frameworks from Wolf‚Äôs studies on imaginary worlds, Baur‚Äôs mechanical precision in worldbuilding, and Howard‚Äôs transmedia expansions, the Moon becomes a total narrative environment that is fully immersive, deeply symbolic, and thematically resonant.

---

## ‚úÖ Status

* The **Story Setting** is finalized, integrated with thematic, character, and plot architectures.
* Ready for scene-level application and transmedia development phases.
