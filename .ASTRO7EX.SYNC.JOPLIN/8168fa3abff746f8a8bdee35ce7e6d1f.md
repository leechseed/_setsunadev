body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# 📘 Layer 3 — Human Interface  \\\n## Expression Set (Non-Binding, Phenomenological)\\\n\\\n> These expressions describe how humans *experience* systemic constraint.  \\\n> They do not grant leverage, immunity, or exemption.  \\\n> Each stabilizes the self while leaving the system intact.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 1. Compression\\\n- **Description**: Identity narrows under pressure; complexity is shed to remain legible.\\\n- **Typical Behaviors**: Simplifying beliefs, reducing roles, choosing one name/face/function.\\\n- **Narrative Function**: Shows how survival demands self-reduction; clarifies stakes.\\\n- **Limit**: Compression improves legibility, not power. It does not expand agency or halt enforcement.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 2. Ritualization\\\n- **Description**: Repetition becomes meaning when outcomes are unavailable.\\\n- **Typical Behaviors**: Daily routines, vows repeated without witnesses, habits maintained despite futility.\\\n- **Narrative Function**: Demonstrates persistence without progress; meaning as upkeep.\\\n- **Limit**: Ritual sustains coherence, not impact. It produces continuity, not change.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3. Defiance Without Expectation\\\n- **Description**: Action taken with no belief in success.\\\n- **Typical Behaviors**: Speaking anyway, acting anyway, choosing loss knowingly.\\\n- **Narrative Function**: Separates dignity from victory; action as refusal, not strategy.\\\n- **Limit**: Defiance reveals power responses but does not negate them.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4. Transactional Intimacy\\\n- **Description**: Relationships formed under risk, leverage, or scarcity.\\\n- **Typical Behaviors**: Conditional trust, negotiated affection, alliances with expiry dates.\\\n- **Narrative Function**: Exposes how systems route love through cost.\\\n- **Limit**: Intimacy mitigates isolation locally but cannot restore circulation or reach.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5. Dissociation\\\n- **Description**: Emotional distance as a survival mechanism under constant threat.\\\n- **Typical Behaviors**: Flat affect, humor under pressure, compartmentalization.\\\n- **Narrative Function**: Makes endurance visible without heroics.\\\n- **Limit**: Dissociation preserves function, not influence; it does not confer resilience to enforcement.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 6. Stubborn Continuity\\\n- **Description**: Refusal to stop despite erasure or irrelevance.\\\n- **Typical Behaviors**: Showing up after exclusion, maintaining presence without audience.\\\n- **Narrative Function**: Frames persistence as labor; existence as effort.\\\n- **Limit**: Continuity does not restore relevance or break isolation.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 7. Quiet Delusion\\\n- **Description**: Private meaning maintained without expectation of recognition.\\\n- **Typical Behaviors**: Personal myths, internal narratives, unshared truths.\\\n- **Narrative Function**: Protects interiority when the exterior is hostile.\\\n- **Limit**: Delusion stabilizes the self but has zero systemic standing.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Guardrail\\\n- **Design Constraint**: Layer 3 expressions may provide meaning, motivation, or persistence—but never immunity, override, or systemic leverage on their own.\\\n\\\n## Usage Note\\\n- Expressions are **descriptive**, not prescriptive.\\\n- No expression is superior.\\\n- Multiple expressions may coexist or shift over time.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3156}]"
