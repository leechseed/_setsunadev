## 1. Structural Theory – *Understanding* as Concern

### **Definition**

* **Understanding**: Appreciating the meaning of something—seeing through the form into its *purpose*, *origin*, or *implication*.
* It is not *knowledge* (which is static), nor is it *learning* (which is active). It is a *cognitive synthesis*—the point where comprehension becomes clarity.

### **Dramatica Placement**

* Domain: **Physics**
* Concern Quad:

  * **Doing**
  * **Obtaining**
  * **Learning**
  * **Understanding** ✅ *(Concern selected)*

### **Dynamic Pair**

* **Understanding** ↔ **Gathering Information**

This pair creates thematic pressure in ASTRO7EX: characters seek truth but only receive *data*. The world’s false systems offer *documentation*, not *comprehension*.

---

## 2. ASTRO7EX Expression – What Everyone Is Trying to Understand

ASTRO7EX is set in a **post-AI-collapse moon colony** ruled by dead protocols (MODS) and necrotic myth (MORN). The world is full of characters who are **active**, but fundamentally **confused**—not about *what* they’re doing, but *why* they are doing it.

### 🧠 Primary Sphere of Concern: *What does any of this mean?*

---

### **Core Questions Shared Across the Story**:

* What *really* caused the Collapse?
* What *was* AN7L—prophet, AI, ghost, or god?
* What do the lobotomized crewmates *remember*?
* What is the meaning of the “Moon War” history being erased or re-written?
* What does it mean that *action persists* even after understanding is lost?

The characters are united not by purpose, but by **conflicted epistemology**—they cannot agree on meaning because **meaning has been weaponized**.

---

## 3. Character-by-Character Breakdown

### 🧬 **Vivian (Main Character)**

* **Seeks Understanding of**: Her mythologized past, the betrayal of her crew, and the silent war being erased.
* **Conflict**: She is *aware* of things she cannot *understand*. Her fame makes truth unreachable.
* **Expression**: Uses analog tools and memory-dives to *reclaim meaning* from MODS-controlled history.

---

### 🪨 **MODS (Impact Character)**

* **Seeks Understanding of**: *Nothing.* MODS don’t seek—they enforce.
* **Conflict**: They *impede* understanding. Their static rules only allow input/output, not synthesis.
* **Expression**: Error messages, denial of metaphysical queries—MODS are a firewall against understanding.

---

### 🗿 **Fiona (Contagonist)**

* **Seeks Understanding of**: *Power through transaction*. She believes everything can be explained via desire.
* **Conflict**: Treats mystery as leverage. She’s allergic to moral understanding.
* **Expression**: Uses emotional clarity to seduce Vivian away from deeper truths.

---

### 💼 **Nacho (Guardian)**

* **Seeks Understanding of**: Duty, loyalty, and the limits of his analog oath.
* **Conflict**: Torn between following operational legacy or interpreting a greater truth.
* **Expression**: Attempts to translate financial, technical, and emotional truths into analog language Vivian can grasp.

---

### 👻 **Myrtle (Sidekick)**

* **Seeks Understanding of**: *What happened to her?* She is fragmented.
* **Conflict**: She is a living symptom of memory corruption.
* **Expression**: Asks questions with no answers—forces others to confront the dissonance between experience and record.

---

### 👑 **John Smith the Eternal (Antagonist)**

* **Seeks Understanding of**: Why his program was revived.
* **Conflict**: Believes the resurrection was divine; refuses to understand it was about a *bitcoin wallet*.
* **Expression**: Constructs false epistemology to justify his mythic continuity.

---

### 🏛️ **The Committee (Skeptic)**

* **Seeks Understanding of**: Only what’s *permissible*. They gatekeep meaning.
* **Conflict**: Understanding is dangerous—it’s destabilizing to their control.
* **Expression**: Sanitize narratives, redact reports, neutralize anyone with unauthorized truth.

---

## 4. Thematic Analysis – Bloom, McKee, Anime, Astrology

---

### **📚 Harold Bloom — The Anxiety of Understanding**

* ASTRO7EX enacts Bloom’s idea of **revisionist truth**: each character tries to *author* the story by overwriting history.
* Vivian is a **strong misreader**: she challenges canonical narratives forced upon her.
* Understanding becomes a **Gnostic rite**—illumination through pain.

---

### **🎞️ 2000s Anime — *Knowing ≠ Understanding***

* *Serial Experiments Lain*: Knowing everything creates madness—not clarity.
* *Ergo Proxy*: Understanding the self is the path to apocalypse.
* *Evangelion*: Characters pursue meaning through *others*, only to realize meaning is internal—but corrupted.

Understanding isn’t just hard. It’s **dangerous**. In ASTRO7EX, truth does not liberate—it *disfigures*.

---

### **📖 McKee — Story = Meaning Made Expressive**

* McKee stresses **true meaning is found through structure**.
* ASTRO7EX shows characters acting without structure, therefore **trapped in misinterpretation**.
* The story is a **collision of actions without meaning**, producing the void that Vivian must navigate.

---

### **🌠 Narrative Astrology**

#### Vivian’s Natal Chart:

* **Mercury in Aries** square **Saturn in Capricorn**:

  * She’s *impulsive with truth* but resented by authority for speaking it.
* **Chiron in Gemini**: Her *wound is in miscommunication and misunderstood legacy*.

#### Transits:

* Uranus transit her IC: *truth erupts from roots*.
* Neptune square Mercury: She cannot distinguish real understanding from illusion.

#### Progressions:

* Progressed Moon into Scorpio: Deep intuition, painful clarity.
* Progressed Mercury Retrograde: Truth now moves **backward**—she must *un-understand* what she was taught.

## 5. Summary – How ASTRO7EX Illustrates “Understanding” as Overall Story Concern

In ASTRO7EX, **Understanding** functions as the shared emotional and cognitive battlefield. Every major character is either:

* **Desperate for meaning**,
* **Deluded by meaning**, or
* **Controlling meaning**.

The tragedy of the story is that **understanding is impossible under a system designed to confuse**. The MODS, the Committee, and MORN operate on logic trees, myths, and silence. They permit data—not comprehension.

Vivian’s story—and the Overall Story—unfolds as a collective search for *what things meant*, even as those meanings are destroyed in real time. Characters fight to reconstruct the past not for nostalgia, but for **liberation from encoded futures**.

This aligns structurally with the Dramatica Concern, thematically with Bloom and McKee, spiritually with narrative astrology, and emotionally with 2000s anime protagonists who find that **understanding comes too late, or costs too much**.
