## Overview

**Narrative Pushbacks** are localized, non-scalable points of resistance that exist *within* a dominant system without threatening its continuity.  
They do not defeat the system.  
They do not reform it.  
They define what the system **cannot fully absorb**.

Pushbacks operate at the level of **character interiority and momentary choice**, not history, institutions, or outcomes.

They are not hope.  
They are **lucidity under coercion**.

---

## Relationship to Narrative Invariants

- **Narrative Invariants** describe what the system *always does*.
- **Narrative Pushbacks** describe what the system *can never completely take*.

Pushbacks do **not** negate invariants.  
They coexist asymmetrically.

## Pushback 1 — Effectiveness Without Fairness

### Statement
**You don’t have to be fair to be effective.**

### Core Function
This pushback breaks the assumption that moral compliance is required for impact.

The system dominates **fair, legible, procedural behavior**.  
Effectiveness can still occur through:
- Asymmetry
- Timing
- Unlegible action
- Refusal to seek validation

### Constraints
- Does not guarantee success
- Does not justify cruelty
- Does not protect the actor from consequences

### Narrative Use
- Learned early through failure
- Enables action without permission
- Forces characters to abandon moral comfort

---

## Pushback 2 — The Mirror of Participation

### Statement
**Look at what you’re giving them.**

### Core Function
This pushback forces self-recognition at the moment of participation.

The system does not merely consume bodies.  
It consumes:
- Compliance
- Performance
- Narrative cooperation
- Identity alignment

This pushback does not stop the sacrifice.  
It removes **anesthesia**.

### Constraints
- Awareness does not equal escape
- Characters may recognize the cost and proceed anyway
- Does not prevent instrumentalization

### Narrative Use
- Spoken as a warning, accusation, or last interruption
- Functions as a “waking up” moment
- Often ignored the first time it appears

---

## Pushback 3 — Interior Ownership of Choice

### Statement
**You know why you did it.**

### Core Function
This pushback defines the one domain the system cannot access:  
**the reason for an action at the moment it was chosen**.

The system controls:
- Records
- Legacy
- Interpretation
- Posthumous identity

It cannot retroactively alter **intent as experienced**.

### Constraints
- Entirely private
- Non-transferable
- Dies with the character
- Offers no vindication

### Narrative Use
- Spoken quietly, rarely, and late
- Functions as an afterimage of moral clarity
- Persists even when the character is remembered as wrong or monstrous

---

## Structural Properties of Pushbacks

- **Localized** — apply to individuals, not movements
- **Non-scalable** — cannot be systematized
- **Non-institutional** — cannot be encoded as policy
- **Non-redemptive** — do not promise reward or rescue

Pushbacks create **friction**, not progress.

---

## Design Guidance

- Never allow all pushbacks to be spoken by the same character.
- Pushbacks should be learned through loss, not instruction.
- A pushback may be recognized too late to act on.
- A character may violate a pushback knowingly.

Pushbacks are not rules for winning.  
They are rules for **remaining awake**.

---

## Summary

**Narrative Pushbacks define what cannot be taken, even when everything else is.**

They do not weaken the system.  
They prevent total annihilation of interior meaning.

They are not remembered.  
They are not recorded.  
They are **experienced**.
