body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# 📘 Layer 3 — Writer-Facing Violation Checklist  \\\n## Human Interface Integrity Audit\\\n\\\n> Use this checklist during outlining, drafting, or revision.  \\\n> If any item triggers **YES**, review the scene or arc for Layer 3 violations.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## A. System Override Detection  \\\n**(Layer 3 must never overpower Layers 0–2)**\\\n\\\n- ☐ Does a character’s emotional breakthrough *halt*, *delay*, or *soften* enforcement?\\\n- ☐ Does psychological insight directly change institutional behavior?\\\n- ☐ Does trauma, suffering, or endurance grant new systemic access or protection?\\\n- ☐ Does a personal realization function as a causal lever in the plot?\\\n\\\n**If YES** → Layer 3 is overriding system mechanics.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## B. Specialness Leak  \\\n**(No character is exempt by depth, pain, or sincerity)**\\\n\\\n- ☐ Is a character treated as immune to isolation, erasure, or accumulation?\\\n- ☐ Does the narrative imply this character “matters more” to the system?\\\n- ☐ Are consequences suspended because the character is exceptional, chosen, or uniquely aware?\\\n- ☐ Would the same outcome occur if a less-developed character made the same choice?\\\n\\\n**If YES** → Protagonist exceptionalism has breached the layer boundary.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## C. Meaning → Effect Slippage  \\\n**(Meaning must not equal leverage)**\\\n\\\n- ☐ Does inner coherence produce external success?\\\n- ☐ Is healing rewarded with influence, safety, or legitimacy?\\\n- ☐ Does acceptance, forgiveness, or love restore circulation or relevance?\\\n- ☐ Is “understanding” treated as a form of power?\\\n\\\n**If YES** → Meaning is being smuggled in as force.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## D. Expression Misuse  \\\n**(Expressions explain behavior, not outcomes)**\\\n\\\n- ☐ Is an expression framed as “the right way” to survive the system?\\\n- ☐ Do characters who adopt a specific expression outperform others?\\\n- ☐ Is an expression treated as a strategy rather than a coping shape?\\\n- ☐ Does the story imply moral superiority yields structural advantage?\\\n\\\n**If YES** → Expressions are being promoted to mechanics.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## E. Resistance Sanitization  \\\n**(Resistance reveals power; it does not erase it)**\\\n\\\n- ☐ Does resistance reduce pressure instead of increasing or exposing it?\\\n- ☐ Is opposition rewarded simply for existing?\\\n- ☐ Does truth-telling interrupt enforcement?\\\n- ☐ Does defiance succeed without cost, residue, or isolation?\\\n\\\n**If YES** → Layer 2 constraints are being violated via Layer 3.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## F. Withdrawal Illusion  \\\n**(Disengagement is not escape)**\\\n\\\n- ☐ Does withdrawal protect a character from consequences?\\\n- ☐ Is opting out framed as safety rather than exposure?\\\n- ☐ Does absence function as resistance rather than forfeiture?\\\n- ☐ Is isolation portrayed as freedom without loss?\\\n\\\n**If YES** → Punishment Logic is being bypassed.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## G. Emotional Resolution Fallacy  \\\n**(Closure ≠ victory)**\\\n\\\n- ☐ Does emotional resolution coincide with systemic resolution?\\\n- ☐ Is “letting go” treated as a way out of enforcement?\\\n- ☐ Does narrative closure imply stability or safety going forward?\\\n- ☐ Are loose ends tied because the character has made peace?\\\n\\\n**If YES** → Layer 3 has been mistaken for an ending.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## H. Final Sanity Check  \\\n**(The One Question That Catches Almost Everything)**\\\n\\\n- ☐ If this scene were stripped of the character’s internal experience, would the system behave the same way?\\\n\\\n**If NO** → Layer 3 has illegally influenced system behavior.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Pass Condition\\\n\\\nA scene **passes** Layer 3 integrity if:\\\n- The system behaves identically regardless of inner experience.\\\n- Emotional truth deepens cost, not outcome.\\\n- Expressions stabilize characters without granting leverage.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Usage Tip\\\n\\\nRun this checklist:\\\n- Once at outline\\\n- Once at midpoint\\\n- Once during final revision\\\n\\\nLayer 3 violations compound quietly.  \\\nEarly detection preserves the entire stack.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3781}]"
