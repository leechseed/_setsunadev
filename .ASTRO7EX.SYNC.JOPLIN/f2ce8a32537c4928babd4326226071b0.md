A metaphysical force\\\n2. A worldview\\\n3. A social apparatus (or anti-apparatus)\\\n4. A narrative pressure system\\\n\\\n| Power   | What It Fundamentally Does |\\\n|--------|----------------------------|\\\n| Grace  | Makes actions *legitimate* through bestowed alignment |\\\n| Gnosis | Makes systems *false* through revealed structure |\\\n| Technae | Makes reality *repeatable* through construction |\\\n| Wyrd | Makes outcomes *inevitable* without method |\\\n\\\nThis ensures power is **philosophical before mechanical**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Overlay: Four Powers × Invariants-First Design\\\n\\\n### Invariants-First Recap\\\nInvariants are **non-negotiable constraints on meaning**:\\\n- true in dialogue\\\n- true in character arcs\\\n- true in world history\\\n- true in systems\\\n\\\nThey are your IP’s **governor**.\\\n\\\n### The Overlay Relationship\\\n**Invariants say what must remain true.**  \\\n**The Four Powers make those truths unavoidable.**\\\n\\\nThink of it like this:\\\n\\\n- **Invariants** = Commander’s Intent (what the IP is about)\\\n- **Four Powers** = The operating environment that enforces that intent\\\n\\\n### Example Overlay\\\nIf an invariant is:\\\n> *Power always has a cost.*\\\n\\\nThe Four Powers guarantee that:\\\n- Grace creates obligation and desolation\\\n- Gnosis creates alienation and sterile insight\\\n- Technae creates rot and escalation\\\n- Wyrd creates collateral destiny and scapegoats\\\n\\\nNo author discretion required.  \\\nThe system enforces the invariant by default.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## How the Four Powers Govern Scale\\\n\\\nThe system works identically at every narrative level.\\\n\\\n### Sentence / Dialogue\\\nPower verbs encode meaning instantly:\\\n- *bless* (Grace)\\\n- *unveil* (Gnosis)\\\n- *forge* (Technae)\\\n- *proc* (Wyrd)\\\n\\\nA single word choice can signal legitimacy, corruption, or impending fallout.\\\n\\\n### Scene\\\nScenes become about:\\\n- paying a power’s cost\\\n- triggering its failure mode\\\n- provoking institutional response\\\n\\\nA scene “works” if power use leaves a trace.\\\n\\\n### Arc / Season\\\nArcs escalate by:\\\n- institutional capture\\\n- schism\\\n- arms race\\\n- humiliation of control\\\n\\\nNot by raw ability increases.\\\n\\\n### World / History\\\nWorld history becomes explainable through:\\\n- Grace desolations\\\n- Gnostic schisms\\\n- Technic rot\\\n- Wyrd collapses\\\n\\\nCivilizations don’t fall “because plot”—they fail structurally.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Why This Prevents Power Creep and Lore Rot\\\n\\\n### No Horizontal Bloat\\\nNew content must:\\\n- map to one of four ontologies\\\n- inherit its costs and failures\\\n- respect existing apparatus logic\\\n\\\nThis prevents infinite subclasses.\\\n\\\n### No Vertical Escalation\\\nPower doesn’t scale by magnitude.\\\nIt scales by:\\\n- legitimacy\\\n- distribution\\\n- institutional reach\\\n- collateral damage\\\n\\\nWhich keeps tension high without absurdity.\\\n\\\n### No Lore Without Teeth\\\nEvery artifact, rite, or faction:\\\n- must do something operational\\\n- must create pressure elsewhere\\\n- must reinforce an invariant\\\n\\\nIf it doesn’t, it’s dead content.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Narrative Capabilities the System Unlocks\\\n\\\nThis system enables:\\\n\\\n- **Institutional horror** (systems that function while rotting)\\\n- **Moral injury** (winning that costs identity)\\\n- **Schism-driven plots** (truth vs authority)\\\n- **Comedy as terror** (Wyrd humiliating governance)\\\n- **Tragedy without nihilism** (Grace still means something)\\\n- **Political theology without lectures**\\\n- **Fate without determinism**\\\n\\\nAll without tonal collapse.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Operational Use: How to Apply This While Writing\\\n\\\n### During Ideation\\\nAsk:\\\n- Which power is being invoked?\\\n- What obligation or injury follows?\\\n- Which apparatus reacts?\\\n\\\n### During Editing\\\nKill anything that:\\\n- bypasses a power’s cost\\\n- grants outcome without trace\\\n- solves conflict without institutional response\\\n\\\n### During Worldbuilding\\\nOnly add lore that:\\\n- enforces an invariant\\\n- creates second-order effects\\\n- escalates system pressure\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Summary: What the Four Powers Actually Do for the IP\\\n\\\nThe Four Powers framework is:\\\n\\\n- a **power ontology** that replaces magic and brute force\\\n- a **continuity lock** that prevents drift and creep\\\n- a **conflict engine** that never runs dry\\\n- a **meaning enforcement system** for your invariants\\\n- a **scale-bridging architecture** from sentence to civilization\\\n\\\n**Invariants define what the IP must mean.**  \\\n**The Four Powers make that meaning inevitable.**\\\n\\\nIf the invariants are your constitution,  \\\nthe Four Powers are the physics that make violating it impossible.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6776}]"
