.01 Overall Story Name - Prophets of Rot

1 Overall Story Name

Absolutely. Naming the **Overall Story Throughline** is a vital part of **Illustration** in Dramatica Step 3‚Äîit gives the system-wide conflict a **narrative title**, **genre identity**, and **philosophical echo**.

Because ASTRO7EX is:

* Deeply **American** in its obsession with corrupted memory, post-religious power, and individual resistance
* Saturated in **2000s anime DNA** (*Ergo Proxy*, *Texhnolyze*, *Evangelion*, *Boogiepop Phantom*, *Lain*)
* Fueled by **sci-fi spiritual tension**
* Driven by astrological weight: Saturn (inertia), Pluto (legacy rot), Neptune (dream/illusion), Scorpio Mercury (paranoia), Capricorn (systemic failure)

We want names that capture:

* Bureaucratic decay and spiritual erosion
* Techno-prophecy as control
* Sexual numbness and psychic revolt
* The haunting pressure of **not changing** in a system that‚Äôs already dead

Let‚Äôs explore some options.

---

## üìú DRAMATICA CRITERIA

> In ten words or fewer, the Overall Story name should:

* **Reflect the shared conflict**
* Be **thematically infused**, not literal
* Resonate with **symbolic or tonal gravity**
* Capture the **system-wide dilemma**, not Vivian‚Äôs personal arc

## üß† RECOMMENDED TOP 3 (for your tone & system)

| Rank | Title                         | Reason                                                                            |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ü•á   | **The Gospel of Maintenance** | Deeply American, ironic, system-faithful; captures OS Issue and Problem perfectly |
| ü•à   | **Prophets of Rot**           | Mythic, Shakespearean, Bloomian, ties into prophecy and decay                     |
| ü•â   | **Don‚Äôt Wake the Ghost King** | Narrative-forward, symbolic, tech-gothic, cool as merch/arc name too              |

## üßæ Harold Bloom Tie-In

> ‚ÄúAmerican storytelling is about isolation, myth, and the refusal to change. We worship the past as a prosthetic soul.‚Äù

* ASTRO7EX is not about *saving the world*.
* It‚Äôs about **what we do when the world already failed**‚Äîand someone keeps hitting *restore*.
* Naming the Overall Story reveals what the culture in ASTRO7EX believes is worth preserving‚Äî**even if it kills them**.

Let me know which name to lock, or if you want alt takes styled differently (e.g., **in-universe language**, religious tone, corporate slogan, etc.).
