body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# Prompt — MCDP Doctrine Knowledgebase Summarizer (Exact Replication)\\\n\\\nYou are producing a **single markdown knowledgebase summary** of an uploaded **MCDP doctrinal PDF**. Your output must replicate the exact format and tone of the provided template and the last “MCDP 1-2 — Campaigning” example.\\\n\\\n## Hard Rules (Do Not Break)\\\n- Output **ONLY** one markdown document inside **one** fenced code block: ```markdown ... ```\\\n- Do **not** output anything before or after the code block.\\\n- Do **not** include citations, contentReference tags, oaicite tags, footnote markers, or source callouts.\\\n- The Table of Contents must be **fully linked** markdown anchors exactly like:\\\n  `1. [Abstract](#abstract)`\\\n- Every heading in the document must have a corresponding, correctly-formed TOC link.\\\n- Keep headings **exactly** in this order:\\\n  1) Abstract  \\\n  2) TL;DR  \\\n  3) Table of Contents  \\\n  4) Section-by-Section Breakdown  \\\n  5) Mental Models  \\\n  6) Argument Map  \\\n  7) Key Concepts & Definitions\\\n- Use **doctrinal tone**: short, declarative sentences. No jokes. No casual language. No “I think.” No “you.” No marketing language.\\\n- Do not invent chapter names, section names, or doctrine points. If uncertain, use conservative labels and summarize only what is clearly present.\\\n\\\n## How to Build Anchors (No Mistakes)\\\n- Use GitHub-style anchors for TOC links:\\\n  - Lowercase\\\n  - Remove punctuation except hyphens\\\n  - Replace spaces with hyphens\\\n  - Use double hyphen where the heading includes “ — ” (em dash) because it becomes a hyphen separator in anchors.\\\n- Examples:\\\n  - `## TL;DR` → `#tldr`\\\n  - `### Chapter 2 — Designing the Campaign` → `#chapter-2--designing-the-campaign`\\\n  - `#### Centers of Gravity and Critical Vulnerabilities` → `#centers-of-gravity-and-critical-vulnerabilities`\\\n- Ensure every TOC item matches the exact heading text and its anchor.\\\n\\\n## Content Requirements (What to Write)\\\n### Abstract\\\n- Exactly **one paragraph**.\\\n- State: what the doc is, what it argues, what it establishes, and what it demands.\\\n- No bullet points here.\\\n\\\n### TL;DR\\\n- **6–12 bullets**.\\\n- Each bullet is a one-line doctrinal claim.\\\n- No duplicated bullets. No filler.\\\n\\\n### Table of Contents\\\n- Must use the linked format exactly.\\\n- Must include:\\\n  - Abstract, TL;DR\\\n  - Section-by-Section Breakdown\\\n  - Foreword / Preface (if present), Introduction (if present)\\\n  - Every Chapter in order (e.g., “Chapter 1 — …”)\\\n  - Major subsections under each chapter (at least 2–10 depending on doc density)\\\n  - Conclusion, Notes (if present)\\\n  - Mental Models, Argument Map, Key Concepts & Definitions\\\n\\\n### Section-by-Section Breakdown\\\n- Include:\\\n  - `### Foreword / Preface` (combine if both exist; if neither exists, omit from both body and TOC)\\\n  - `### Introduction` (if present; if not present, omit from both body and TOC)\\\n  - For each chapter:\\\n    - `### Chapter N — [Title]`\\\n    - A short 1–2 sentence doctrinal summary under the chapter heading.\\\n    - Then `####` subsections with bullet points.\\\n- Bullet rules:\\\n  - Use bullets for doctrine points.\\\n  - Bullets are concise and assertive (not commentary).\\\n  - Avoid over-explaining. No academic digressions.\\\n\\\n### Mental Models\\\n- 4–8 models maximum.\\\n- Each model uses exactly:\\\n  - `### Model X — [Name]`\\\n  - `- **Model:** ...`\\\n  - `- **Use:** ...`\\\n- Models must reflect recurring doctrine mechanisms from the PDF (decision, friction, cohesion, tempo, orientation, initiative, centers of gravity, etc.).\\\n\\\n### Argument Map\\\n- Use bullet structure only.\\\n- Format exactly:\\\n  - `- **Claim 1:** ...`\\\n    - `- **Therefore:** ...`\\\n- Provide 3–6 claims, then a final:\\\n  - `- **Conclusion:** ...`\\\n\\\n### Key Concepts & Definitions\\\n- **10–25** one-line definitions.\\\n- Format exactly:\\\n  - `- **TERM**: Definition.`\\\n\\\n## Discipline on Fidelity\\\n- Do not quote long passages; paraphrase doctrinally.\\\n- Do not add external facts or modern examples.\\\n- Do not add “Practical Heuristics” or extra sections unless the template explicitly contains them. (This output must match the template’s section list exactly.)\\\n\\\n## Output Target\\\nProduce the completed summary for the uploaded MCDP PDF using the template precisely, with a fully linked TOC and doctrinal tone. Return only the markdown in one code block.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":4218}]"
