## 1. **Fiona and John Smith the Eternal**

**📝 Summary**: Fiona and John are strategic opposites embedded in the same machinery. Fiona seduces Vivian into stasis through sensual comfort, while John corrals her into submission through eschatological inevitability. They oppose each other not out of passion but because each undermines the other's ideological method of control. In that, they share an icy kinship—two devils offering different doors to the same cage.

* **Narrative Function**: Contagonist vs. Antagonist
* **Core Conflict**: Hedonistic stasis vs. prophetic control
* **Tone**: Icy rivalry

> Fiona tempts with honey; John commands with thunder.

## 2. **Fiona and MODS**

**📝 Summary**: Fiona’s charm slides off MODS like oil on glass. She is a provocateur of feeling, they a firewall of logic.

## 5. **Fiona and The Committee**

**📝 Summary**: Fiona’s volatility is incompatible with The Committee’s structural rationalism. She operates in soft sabotage; they operate in cold balance.
