body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\" New Master Logline (Including Ghost Girl Twist Subtly)\\\n\\\n    After the lunar heist of the century, fixer-turned-goddess Vivian lives untouchable in the lava-tube cities of the Moon—until a hyperhuman assassin lobotomizes the memory of the job and leaves her for dead. She’s saved by a mysterious young admirer and sinks into drugs and distraction, numbing the hole the heist left behind. But when her former crewmate turns up brain-wiped, Vivian realizes she may be the last person alive who can stop what they unearthed: a buried supersoldier program tied to a mythic AI known as the Godking. As ultra-Mormon capitalists race to resurrect it and reclaim Earth, Vivian claws her way back to purpose—only to discover that the one voice keeping her sane may never have existed at all.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":782}]"
