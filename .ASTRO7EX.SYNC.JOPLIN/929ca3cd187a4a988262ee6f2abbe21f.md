## üß† Overview

In *ASTRO7EX*, the pursuit of the Overall Story Goal ‚Äî dismantling cosmic stasis and reclaiming narrative sovereignty ‚Äî depends entirely on the concept of *Doing*. These are not metaphorical reflections but explicit, violent, and recursive acts that must be performed. Each act exposes existential wounds and embodies the characters' ultimate defiance before cosmic oblivion.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Thematic Context of Requirement

* **Theory**: Goals demand sequences of embodied acts; agency is only claimed through motion.
* **Definition**: *Doing* is physical, active engagement ‚Äî existential movement as opposed to passive observation.
* **Dynamic Pair**: *Doing* vs. *Obtaining* ‚Äî ASTRO7EX requires endless acts of defiance before any fragment of "Obtaining" can even be imagined.

---

## üåÄ Doing as Requirement

* The story demands acts like system hacks, lunar heists, sacred infiltrations, and psychic sabotage.
* Each act transcends tactical function and becomes a cosmic protest against stasis.
* "Doing" is both a means and a revelation: each step forward tears the self deeper.

---

## üî• Character-Specific Requirements

* **Vivian**

  * Rewrites lunar vault protocols; physically disrupts MODS installations.
  * Self-mutilates as part of psychic infiltration rituals.
* **Myrtle**

  * Physically overwrites data vaults; acts as a ghost operative disrupting AI nexus points.
* **Nacho**

  * Executes hidden assassinations; performs blood-line rites to protect Vivian's psychic trail.
* **John Smith the Eternal**

  * Enacts mass sacrifice events; installs physical narrative tokens across lunar mythic nodes.
* **The Committee**

  * Stages violent purifications; coordinates exterminations of non-compliant data agents.
* **The MODS**

  * Launch viral nullification strikes; forcibly disrupt active rebel channels.

---

## üß¨ Psychic and Narrative Impact

* **Violent Self-Revelation**: Each act strips illusions, exposing raw psychic core.
* **Existential Spiral**: Doing accelerates character unraveling, looping deeper into labyrinthine decay.
* **Weaponized Agency**: Characters momentarily reclaim power through acts that simultaneously destroy them.

---

## üåë Philosophical and Mythic Framing

* **Promethean Acts**: Fire theft as violent Doing, each act a defiant theft against cosmic order.
* **Ritual Praxis**: Knowledge emerges through flesh and ruin rather than intellectual contemplation.
* **Labyrinth Descent**: Each act echoes deeper into personal and cosmic labyrinths ‚Äî an unending spiral toward existential void.

---

## üìñ Literary & Theoretical Context

* **Shakespeare**: Macbeth‚Äôs blood-soaked path; Lear‚Äôs bodily collapse on the heath.
* **Harold Bloom**: Doing as mythic misreading ‚Äî rewriting the self through violent acts.
* **McKee**: True character forged and revealed through destructive motion under crushing pressure.

| 2  | *The Anatomy of Story*                    | John Truby         | Acts embody moral argument; ASTRO7EX turns acts into cosmic moral crucifixions, burning identity for fragments of agency.                |
| 3  | *Save the Cat!*                           | Blake Snyder       | Plot beats as active milestones; ASTRO7EX warps them into spirals of existential violence rather than progressions.                      |

| 7  | *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*          | Joseph Campbell    | "Road of Trials" is perverted into cyclical ruptures rather than heroic growth.                                                          |
| 8  | *Screenplay*                              | Syd Field          | Story progress as Doing; ASTRO7EX‚Äôs progress as collapse rather than ascent.                                                             |
| 9  | *The Art of Dramatic Writing*             | Lajos Egri         | Action as premise solidification; ASTRO7EX‚Äôs acts are cosmic premise incarnations.                                                       |

| 12 | *Plot & Structure*                        | James Scott Bell   | Action as signposts; ASTRO7EX turns signposts into fractal collapse signals.                                                             |
| 13 | *Story Engineering*                       | Larry Brooks       | Structural acts as engineered soul explosions; each required act cracks the cosmic shell.                                                |
| 14 | *Aristotle‚Äôs Poetics*                     | Aristotle          | Praxis as final tragic realization; ASTRO7EX stretches praxis into existential protest.                                                  |

| 16 | *The Art of the Start*                    | Guy Kawasaki       | Acts as iterative launches; ASTRO7EX reframes them as recursive psychic deaths.                                                          |
| 17 | *Writing for Emotional Impact*            | Karl Iglesias      | Acts as soul-level confrontations; ASTRO7EX weaponizes these as emotional grenades.                                                      |
| 18 | *Mastering Suspense, Structure, and Plot* | Jane K. Cleland    | Action ratchets tension; ASTRO7EX twists this into spiraling dread and disintegration.                                                   |

## üü£ Dramatica Summary

In *ASTRO7EX*, the Overall Story's Requirement is encapsulated in *Doing* ‚Äî violent, embodied, and recursive acts that rip open cosmic inertia. Through Dramatica‚Äôs structural framework, Requirements are non-negotiable accomplishments paving the way to the Goal. Here, each Doing is a psychic incision: heists, data sabotage, ritual sacrifices, lunar assaults. Every act exposes raw narrative nerve endings, fracturing identity while forging temporary agency. This requirement embodies the core moral premise: meaning is violently carved, not granted. Acts become cosmic signatures, asserting transient existence against a sterile, mythic void.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

In *ASTRO7EX*, the Overall Story's Requirement demands unrelenting *Doing* ‚Äî not as progress but as existential dismemberment and defiant art. Each act is a violent calligraphy of self-annihilation and ghost assertion. Supported by rigorous theoretical models and astrological framing, these acts become the final evidence of each character‚Äôs tragic agency and cosmic resistance. In the end, Doing is not about winning but about refusing to be still.
