# 📘 Layer 0 — Ontological Reality

## Ontology
**A promise never kept does not exist.**

> Reality only recognizes what is enacted. Intent without execution has no ontological weight.

## Causality
**Resistance reveals power; it does not erase it.**

> Opposition exposes the true scale, structure, and response of power without guaranteeing its removal.

## Time / Accumulation
**Left alone, power grows.**

> Inaction and indecision advantage existing power structures through accumulation over time.

## Irreversibility / Cost
**You don’t walk away clean.**

> Every action leaves residue; payment alters the actor and permanently changes the state.

## Entropy / Decay
**Integrity requires maintenance.**

> Coherence, stability, and legitimacy persist only through continuous effort.

---

# 📘 Layer 1 — Value & Meaning Logic

## Reward Logic
**The system rewards inputs, not beliefs.**

> Only actions that enter the system are legible. Intent, sincerity, and conviction have no weight unless enacted.

## Punishment Logic
**The system punishes withdrawal by letting it fail.**

> Disengagement is permitted but unsupported; absence forfeits protection and allows failure to proceed unmitigated.

## Ignorance Logic
**The system ignores suffering.**

> Pain and loss do not register unless they alter outcomes; endurance alone carries no moral or systemic claim.

---

# 📘 Layer 2 — Power & Systemic Force

## Persistence
**Truth does not interrupt enforcement.**

> Knowing, revealing, or proving does not pause action; enforcement proceeds independently of awareness or legitimacy.

## Delegation
**Enforcement is outsourced.**

> Force is applied through intermediaries; responsibility is diffuse while outcomes remain intact.

## Enforcement
**The system isolates threats.**

> Disruption is not destroyed or debated; it is cut off from circulation, relevance, and reach.

---

# 📘 Layer 3 — Human Interface

## Compression
**Identity narrows to remain legible.**

> Under constraint, complexity is shed. The self contracts toward what can be tolerated, categorized, or passed through the system.

## Ritualization
**Repetition replaces causality.**

> When action no longer changes results, sequence preserves coherence and prevents collapse.

## Defiance Without Expectation
**Action continues without belief in success.**

> Choices are made despite certainty of loss; refusal is expressed through motion, not strategy.

## Transactional Intimacy
**Closeness is routed through cost.**

> Relationships form under leverage, risk, or exchange; affection persists, but with terms.

## Dissociation
**Feeling is reduced to maintain operation.**

> Emotional distance enables endurance when proximity would overwhelm capacity.

## Stubborn Continuity
**Presence is maintained without recognition.**

> The self remains despite exclusion, invisibility, or irrelevance.

## Quiet Delusion
**Private meaning is maintained without standing.**

> Significance is held internally without expectation of validation, confirmation, or effect.

---

# 📘 Layer 4 — Expression Mechanics

## Commit
**Choice hardens into responsibility.**

> An action is taken that cannot be undone without consequence; future options narrow and residue remains.

## Refuse
**Consent is withdrawn without replacement.**

> Participation stops. Risk and burden are pushed outward, forcing pressure to reroute or escalate.

## Reveal
**Knowledge surfaces at a cost.**

> Information becomes legible, redistributing threat and vulnerability—often to the benefit of existing power.

## Delay
**Waiting makes outcomes worse.**

> Resolution is deferred; options decay as accumulation favors whoever already holds advantage.

## Escalate
**Conflict expands when blocked.**

> Consequences intensify, exits narrow, and loss becomes more expensive.

## Isolate
**Circulation is cut off.**

> A subject may survive, but reach, relevance, and effect are severed.

## Transfer Risk
**Consequences are displaced.**

> Blame, exposure, or harm shifts to another carrier while outcomes persist.

## Close
**Paths are permanently foreclosed.**

> A future choice is eliminated entirely; recovery is no longer possible without loss.

---

# 📘 Layer 5 — Structural Argument

## Constraint
**No choice allows this outcome.**

> Across repeated attempts, the system prevents the result regardless of intent, strategy, or sacrifice.

## Cost
**Survival exacts permanent loss.**

> Endurance irreversibly removes something essential; residue compounds.

## Power
**Power reacts predictably when challenged.**

> Resistance triggers enforcement, delegation, or isolation—not reform.

## Legibility
**Only inputs are recognized.**

> Beliefs and pain do not alter outcomes unless translated into effect.

## Agency
**Choices alter outcomes, not constraints.**

> Decisions matter locally; the system remains unchanged.

## Persistence (Structural)
**Left unattended, dominance grows.**

> Accumulation advantages power; resistance decays without maintenance.

## Meaning
**Meaning can exist without effect.**

> Dignity and resolve persist internally even as the system remains unmoved.

## Collapse (Structural)
**Failure requires a specific condition.**

> Systems fail only when a dependency breaks.

---

# 📘 Layer 6 — Terminal States

## Containment
**The system holds.**

> Pressure is absorbed or isolated; structure remains intact.

## Attrition
**Survival continues at diminishing capacity.**

> Cost compounds until continuation becomes the burden.

## Exhaustion
**Opposition ceases without victory.**

> Action stops; nothing is resolved.

## Displacement
**The outcome relocates without improvement.**

> Dynamics persist elsewhere.

## Adaptation
**Disruption is absorbed and normalized.**

> Resistance becomes procedure; the system strengthens.

## Fragmentation
**The system remains, but continuity fails.**

> Local coherence breaks without total collapse.

## Collapse
**A sustaining condition fails.**

> The system can no longer reproduce itself.

## Replacement
**A new structure assumes function.**

> Power reorganizes without moral correction.
