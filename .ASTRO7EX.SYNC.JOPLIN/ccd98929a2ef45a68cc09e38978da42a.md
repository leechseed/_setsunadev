## üß† Overview

Nacho‚Äôs interests function as living expressions of his inner moral code rather than superficial preferences. Every like and dislike affirms his commitment to sovereignty, disciplined devotion, and spiritual guardianship. His attachments are never casual‚Äîthey are oaths. Drawing from *The Erotic Mind* (Morin), *King, Warrior, Magician, Lover* (Moore & Gillette), and *Iron John* (Bly), Nacho‚Äôs catalog of interests forms a quiet liturgy of masculine sanctity and restraint.
