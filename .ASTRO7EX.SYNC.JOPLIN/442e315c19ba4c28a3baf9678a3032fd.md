# SCENE STORY TEST — Keep, Lose, or Spiff Up

*(a.k.a. “Keep, Lose, or Spiff Up”)*

---

### **How to Use**
- **Keep** scenes that clearly satisfy **one or more** checklist items below.  
- **Spiff Up** scenes that need work to **prove their worth** against the checklist.  
- **Lose** scenes that **don’t add to the story** in any of these ways.

---

### **Scene Evaluation Checklist**
1. **New Information** — Does the scene provide new facts, revelations, or plot data?  
2. **New Emotion** — Does it explore a distinct emotional beat or tone shift?  
3. **Sequence Cohesion** — Does it hold a sequence together (setup/bridge/payoff)?  
4. **Memorable Set Piece** — Is there a standout moment that **also** drives story?  
5. **Audience Insight** — Does it give the audience new understanding or perspective?  
6. **Correct Placement** — Is the scene in the right place within the overall flow?  
7. **Intent Alignment** — Does the scene effectively execute its main intentions?  
8. **Self-Contained Mini-Story** — Does it tell a coherent beat with beginning/middle/end?
