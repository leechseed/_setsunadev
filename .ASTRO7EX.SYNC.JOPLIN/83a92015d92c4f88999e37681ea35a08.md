They don't engage; they persist. Their refusal to change becomes a passive form of horror, forcing Vivian to confront a world that will never validate her. ASTRO7EX becomes a story of resistance, not through battle, but through the relentless refusal to be silent in the face of dead logic.\\\n\\\n### **Core Concept**\\\n- **Fixed Attitude**: MODS embody the Dramatica concept of a *fixed attitude*—unchanging thought patterns that resist influence or growth.\\\n- **Function**: As the **Impact Character**, they force Vivian to confront the narrative without reciprocating growth or change.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### **Behavioral Tra\"],[0,\"it\"],[-1,\"’\"],[0,\"s \"],[-1,\"**an epistemological firewall** against story itself.
