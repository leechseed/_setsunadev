## ‚úÖ Summary

Across all characters, ASTRO7EX has achieved a highly layered character architecture, integrating psychological wounds, symbolic design, and Dramatica-based narrative logic. The extensive inclusion of **Narrative Astrology** (Natal Charts, Transits, Progressions) ensures cosmic and archetypal consistency. Each character operates not merely as a plot function but as a living embodiment of ASTRO7EX‚Äôs core thematic tension: corrupted memory versus chosen meaning. The progression thus far delivers a cast prepared to execute an interlocking narrative matrix of cosmic, psychological, and dramatic depth.
