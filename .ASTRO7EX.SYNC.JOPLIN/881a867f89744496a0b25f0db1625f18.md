 Story Synopsis Composition

## TITLE: Story Synopsis Composition

### **Definition**

A **Story Synopsis** is a compact, high-impact paragraph that establishes the **core narrative hook**, distilling dramatic conflict, stakes, and character into a brief setup. It is **not** a plot summary. It is a **functional story capsule**, used across screenplay treatments, Dramatica frameworks, project bibles, and development decks.

> A good synopsis isn’t about what happens. It’s about what *matters.*

### **Purpose of the Story Synopsis**

* Establish the **core dramatic conflict**
* Introduce **main character or character set**
* Define the **stakes**
* Clarify the **goal or dilemma**
* Evoke **tone and genre**
* **Hook attention** for further development or pitching

---

### **Core Components**

#### 1. **Backdrop & Context**

* Define the **state of the world**
* Anchor the setting, genre, or tone
* Optionally mention systems, institutions, or powers

#### 2. **Catalyst / Escalation**

* Introduce what **disturbs the status quo**
* Emphasize the threat, twist, or rising danger

#### 3. **Goal / Mission**

* Define what **must be done**
* Establish what’s being pursued, resisted, or prevented

#### 4. **Protagonist or POV Hook**

* Specify **who we follow**
* Clarify their **initial condition** or internal challenge

#### 5. **Stakes**

* Highlight **what’s at risk**
* Emotional, societal, existential, or relational consequences

#### 6. **Tone / Mood Signal**

* Implied through **language, scale, and phrasing**
* Signals genre flavor: grimdark, hopeful, absurd, etc.

### **Template Formula**

```text
It is a time of [conflict/state]. [Opposition or threat] has [world effect], leaving only [underdogs/outsiders] to resist.
With [new escalation], the stakes rise to [consequence].
[Protagonist(s)] must [mission or goal] to survive or defy fate.
But this is also the story of [character description] who [emotional arc or personal quest].
```

---

### **Writing Guidelines**

* Keep it **tight** (2–5 sentences)
* Use **active voice** and **evocative phrasing**
* Avoid excessive names, lore, or backstory
* Focus on **why this story matters**, not what happens next
* **Mirror the genre** in sentence rhythm, word choice, and tone

### **Examples**

#### **Canonical (Star Wars)**

> It is a time of rebellion. The evil Empire has most of the galaxy under its control except for a handful of rebels. However, with the Empire’s new weapon, even the last holdout may be destroyed. The Rebels must find a way to destroy the Death Star. Star Wars is also the story of a farm boy destined to become a hero.

#### **Custom (ASTRO7EX)**

> It is a time of artificial peace. The Space Ranger elite keep order in the outer systems, but only by discarding those deemed unworthy. When a forgotten training experiment known as ASTRO7EX is reactivated, seven kids from society’s bottom rung are forced into a program no one expects them to survive. The system has no place for them—but their pact might be the anomaly that breaks it. This is also the story of a child who believes meaning must be earned in blood.

### **Final Dictum**

> **A synopsis is not a pitch. It’s a promise.**
> It whispers: “This is the world. This is the fire. These are the ones who will burn.”
> **If your synopsis doesn't hum with potential energy, your story won’t detonate.**
