## Terminology Primer (Read First)

- **Lead Room / Look Room / Walk Room** → Empty space **in front** of the direction the subject faces or moves. Gives breathing room and prevents “walling them in.”
- **Headroom / Footroom / Chinroom** → Space above the head / below the feet / below the chin. Too much = drifting; too little = cramped.
- **Power Point** → High-payoff placement node (e.g., rule-of-thirds or phi grid intersections).
- **Edge Tension** → Anxiety created when important shapes sit **too close** to borders; can be used intentionally.
- **Kissing Tangent** → Subject edge barely touches another edge/shape; looks accidental and kills depth.
- **Amputation (Crop at Joint)** → Cropping **exactly** at wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, neck—reads like a mistake.
- **Bleed (Print)** → Artwork extends past the trim edge so there’s no white sliver after cutting. Typical: ~3 mm (≈1/8").
- **Safe Area (Screen/TV)** → Inner margin where text/logos won’t get cut off on devices. (Action-safe/title-safe; modern UIs still respect inner padding.)
- **Gutter/Spine** → The fold/binding area in books/mags; don’t park faces or key details there.
- **Object-fit: cover vs contain (Web)** → `cover` crops to fill; `contain` letterboxes to preserve the whole image.
- **Visual Weight** → Attention pull from **size**, **value contrast**, **saturation**, **edge sharpness**, **detail**, **faces/text**, **warmth**.

> Memorize: **Don’t crop at joints. Protect silhouettes. Leave room where the subject is going.**

---

## How to Use This Guide
- Decide **what the image is about** (one sentence). Place the subject to support that; crop to delete everything else.
- Pick an **armature** (thirds/phi/diagonals) from the Grids guide; then enforce with **value contrast** and **edge control**.
- Design borders like fences: **block exits**, keep **hot spots** inside, and **avoid tangents**.

---

## Strategy: Before You Place or Crop
1. **Intent** → Write the single focal statement.
2. **Include/Exclude List** → Three things you must show; three you will cut.
3. **Format Choice** → Pick aspect ratio by story (square = icon/monument, 16:9 = environment, 4:5 = vertical presence).
4. **Armature** → Thirds for safety, diagonals for energy, spiral for a guided reveal.
5. **Test Crop** → Make brutal crops early (50%, 25%) just to see what still reads. Then rebuild purposefully.

## Subject Placement — Rules that Actually Help

### 4.1 Centering with Intent
**Use when**  
Iconic, confrontational, symmetrical, or ritual scenes.

**How**  
- Center **and** level; make the subject **heaviest** (value/edge).  
- Add micro-asymmetry (pose, accent color) so it isn’t sterile.

**Fix if boring**  
- Shift to **near-symmetry** (tiny offset), or switch to a **diagonal** armature.

**Checklist**  
- Is the center **earned** with hierarchy (brightest/ sharpest at the subject)?

---

### 4.2 Power-Point Placement (Thirds / Phi)
**Use when**  
You want balanced, natural tension without centering.

**How**  
- Put the focal near a **node**; align horizon or key edges to a grid line.  
- Counterbalance with a smaller, hotter accent on the opposing line.

**Fix if generic**  
- Push farther from center or lean into **diagonals** to add energy.  
- Remember **values** still determine first read.

**Checklist**  
- Is the node-backed subject **also** the strongest value contrast?

---

### 4.3 Lead Room / Look Room / Walk Room
**Use when**  
Subjects face or move laterally. The viewer expects space **ahead** of them.

**How**  
- Leave more space **in front** than behind.  
- For fast motion, increase walk room; for contemplative poses, reduce.

**Fix if cramped**  
- Recompose/crop to add breathing room in front; reduce clutter there.

**Checklist**  
- Does the subject feel like they can **breathe** in their direction of travel?

---

### 4.4 Headroom, Footroom, and Chinroom
**Use when**  
Portraits and full-body frames.

**How**  
- Eyes near the **upper third** for portraits.  
- Don’t crowd the chin; keep **chinroom** so the jawline reads.  
- For full-length, give **footroom** to avoid toe amputation.

**Fix if floaty**  
- Reduce headroom or add a **foreground base** (desk, step) to ground them.

**Checklist**  
- Are head/chin/feet clear with intentional spacing?

---

### 4.5 Horizon Management Around People
**Use when**  
Outdoor scenes, urban frames, seascapes.

**How**  
- Keep horizons **off** necks/jaws; either **above the head** or **below the shoulders**.  
- Use horizon to control **power** (low horizon = sky/heroic; high horizon = ground/anchored).

**Fix if spearing**  
- Raise/lower the camera or the person; protect the silhouette.

**Checklist**  
- Is the silhouette clean from horizon mergers?

---

### 4.6 Foreground Anchors & Separation
**Use when**  
You want depth and a guided entry.

**How**  
- Place a **dark/soft** near object as an entry anchor.  
- Ensure **value separation** between foreground and subject; avoid kissing tangents.

**Fix if messy**  
- Simplify the anchor (softer edge, lower detail) or shift it to clear the subject’s contour.

**Checklist**  
- Does the anchor **lead to** (not fight) the subject?

---

### 4.7 Groups & Multi-Subject Placement
**Use when**  
Trios, teams, crowds.

**How**  
- Build **triangles/pyramids**; designate a leader (value/edge/height).  
- Stagger heads (no perfect rows); protect **face silhouettes** from mergers.

**Fix if chaotic**  
- Reduce one person’s contrast/detail; increase spacing around the leader’s face.

**Checklist**  
- Can you identify the leader in under a second?

---

### 4.8 Product/Still-Life Orientation & Label Bias
**Use when**  
Products must read quickly.

**How**  
- Angle objects to reveal **form** (3/4 view) and **label** flat-on where possible.  
- Give hero product more **area** and **contrast**; supporting items echo shape/scale.

**Fix if confusing**  
- Rotate to clarify the **primary face**; simplify background texture.

**Checklist**  
- Can a stranger read the brand/feature instantly?

---

## Cropping — The Discipline

### 5.1 Safe vs. Dangerous Crop Lines (Portraits)
**Safe zones**  
- Mid-forehead, above the eyebrow, mid-upper arm, **mid-thigh**, mid-calf.  
- Cropping a bit into hair or off the top of the head is fine.

**Danger zones (avoid)**  
- **Neck**, **chin**, **wrists**, **elbows**, **knees**, **ankles**, **fingers/toes**.  
- Exact joint crops look like accidents.

**Fixes**  
- Move in/out by a few inches to land in a **safe zone**.  
- If you must crop at a joint, **over-crop decisively** to make it stylized.

---

### 5.2 Action Crops (Speed, Power, Direction)
**Use when**  
Sports, dance, wildlife, vehicles.

**How**  
- Leave extra **walk room**; crop **behind** the motion, not ahead.  
- Consider dynamic **diagonal** crops; blur background to sell speed.

**Fix if sluggish**  
- Tighten the trailing edge; increase lead room; add motion blur.

**Checklist**  
- Does the crop amplify direction and speed?

---

### 5.3 Edge Discipline: Tangents, Kisses, and Exits
**What to avoid**  
- Subject edges barely **touching** borders or other shapes.  
- Bright/sharp corners that **pull out** the eye.

**How to fix**  
- **Commit**: bring the crop in tighter or give more air.  
- Darken/soften corners; add **blockers** or vignettes to keep the eye in.

**Checklist**  
- Any near-misses at borders? Fix them now.

---

### 5.4 Aspect Ratio Choices & Re-Crops
**Guidance**  
- **1:1 (Square)** → Iconic, centered power, tight negative space.  
- **4:5 / 5:4** → Vertical presence (portraits, posters).  
- **3:2 / 4:3** → Versatile classics (photo-native).  
- **16:9** → Cinematic breadth; watch empty flanks.  
- **2.39:1** → Panoramic; design along **diagonals** and anchor multiple beats.

**Re-cropping**  
- Anchor the **focal** so it survives **all** target ratios.  
- Save **alt crops** for vertical/horizontal deliverables; don’t rely on auto-crop.

---

### 5.5 Print vs Screen: Bleed, Safe Areas, and Gutter
**Print**  
- Add **bleed** (~3 mm / 1/8") around edges if color/image runs to the trim.  
- Keep text/logos inside **safe margin** (at least 4–6 mm / ~1/4").  
- Avoid faces/critical details in the **gutter/spine**.

**Screen/Video**  
- Respect **inner padding** for copy and UI (title-safe mindset).  
- Test on multiple devices/aspect ratios; watch notch/rounded-corner cutouts.

---

### 5.6 Responsive/Adaptive Cropping (Web & Apps)
**Principles**  
- Declare the **focal point** (metadata or art-direction crops).  
- Prefer **art-directed variants** over blind `object-fit: cover`.

**Tactics**  
- For hero images: provide **desktop 16:9**, **tablet 4:3**, **mobile 4:5/1:1** versions.  
- Keep text out of the **outer 10–15%** on all sides unless you control the container.

---

## Diagnostics & Stress Tests
- **1-Second Read** → Can a stranger name the subject instantly? If not, your placement/crop failed.
- **Border Patrol** → Scan edges for near-misses, tangents, hot corners. Fix or re-crop.
- **Lead-Room Check** → For faces/motion, is there space **ahead**? If not, shift.
- **Silhouette Pass** → Toggle to silhouette/Notan; if the subject merges, add separation or crop to isolate.
- **Alt-Ratio Preview** → Mock 1:1, 4:5, 16:9 crops. Does the focal survive all?
- **Flip Test** → Horizontal flip; lopsided headroom/lead-room jumps out.

---

## Exercises That Build Skill Fast
1. **Joint-Safe Portrait Set**  
   - Shoot/paint 6 crops of one subject hitting only **safe zones**. Compare readability.

2. **Lead-Room Ladder**  
   - Make 5 frames of a moving subject with increasing lead room. Pick the snap point where speed feels right.

3. **Edge Kill**  
   - Take a “tangent-y” image; produce **two** fixes: tighter decisive crop vs looser air crop. Annotate why one wins.

4. **Alt-Ratio Pack**  
   - Deliver one scene in **1:1**, **4:5**, **16:9**, **2.39:1**. Maintain the same focal and flow.

5. **Gutter Awareness**  
   - Design a two-page spread; move the hero face away from the **spine**; test readability when folded.

6. **Web Art-Direction**  
   - Export desktop/tablet/mobile crops with consistent focal anchoring; test with `cover` vs designed variants.

---

## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)
- **Cropping at Joints** → Looks like a mistake.  
  *Cure*: Move to mid-limb or over-crop decisively.

- **No Lead Room** → Subject suffocates.  
  *Cure*: Add space in front; tighten the trailing side.

- **Horizon Through Heads** → Kills silhouette.  
  *Cure*: Shift horizon up/down.

- **Hot Corners** → Eye exits.  
  *Cure*: Darken/soften; add blockers; crop in.

- **Centering by Habit** → Boring.  
  *Cure*: Use power points or diagonals—center only when it serves the message.

- **Auto-Crop Casualties** → Focal cut off on mobile.  
  *Cure*: Art-direct multiple aspect ratios; define focal metadata.

- **Edge Kisses** → Accidental tension.  
  *Cure*: Commit tighter or give air; never “almost.”

---

## Workflow & Setup (Overlays, Tools, Camera Habits)
- **Overlays**: Thirds/phi grids, diagonal armatures, **safe-area** guides, alt-ratio masks (1:1, 4:5, 16:9, 2.39:1).
- **Software**:  
  - Photoshop/Krita: make a **Crop Presets** set with overlay toggles; save **alt artboards** per ratio.  
  - Figma/Sketch: components with **safe paddings**; variants per breakpoint.  
  - InDesign: master pages with **bleed/safe** and **gutter** reminders.
- **Camera Habits**:  
  - Shoot **wider** than needed when deliverables are unknown (gives crop room).  
  - Level horizons unless intentionally Dutch.  
  - Watch borders in-frame; recompose **before** pressing the shutter.

---

## Cheat Sheet Summary
- Placement: **power point or diagonal** unless the center is **earned**.  
- Cropping: **don’t crop at joints**, protect silhouettes, **leave lead room**.  
- Borders are design tools: avoid tangents, block exits, tame hot corners.  
- Pick aspect ratio for the **story**, export **alt crops** for platforms.  
- Values/edges still trump: the subject must be the **highest-contrast, sharpest** area no matter the crop.

---

## Extended Glossary
- **Action-Safe / Title-Safe** → Inner zones where motion graphics/text won’t be cut off on displays; apply the idea as generous UI padding.  
- **Amputation** → An unintentional crop through a limb/joint—reads as error.  
- **Bleed** → Extra image past trim so print edges go to color; trimmed off after print.  
- **Chinroom** → Space below the chin so jawline reads cleanly.  
- **Edge Tension** → Psychological pull near borders; good for drama, bad when accidental.  
- **Gutter / Spine** → Binding area where content can disappear; avoid placing focal elements here.  
- **Headroom / Footroom** → Space above head / below feet; controls comfort and grounding.  
- **Kissing Tangent** → Edges barely touch; destroys depth/clarity.  
- **Lead Room / Look Room / Walk Room** → Space ahead of gaze/motion to imply future path.  
- **Power Point** → High-value placement node from grids (thirds/phi).  
- **Safe Area** → Inner margin for text/logos to avoid clipping or notch/rounded-corner loss.  
- **Silhouette** → The outer contour; must stay readable against background.  
- **Visual Weight** → Combined pull of size, value contrast, saturation, edge sharpness, detail, faces/text, and warmth.
