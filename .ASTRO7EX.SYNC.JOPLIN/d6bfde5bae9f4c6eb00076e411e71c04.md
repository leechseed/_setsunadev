### 1. **The Committee and Fiona**

**📝 Summary**: Fiona is the virus in The Committee's operating system. Her charm, adaptability, and emotional irrationality run counter to The Committee’s procedural rigidity. They attempt to regulate her presence, but she always finds the cracks in the frame. Their dynamic is a clash of intuition weaponized against logic.

* **Narrative Function**: Reason vs. Contagonist
* **Core Conflict**: Bureaucratic logic vs. emotional disruption
* **Tone**: Calculated frustration

> The Committee files a report. Fiona rewrites the margins.

### 3. **The Committee and MODS**
