He offers comfort, patience, and soothing certainty, the kind of man who'd help you plant a tree while gently warning you of your divine obligations. But beneath his fatherly kindness lies the dramatic function of the **Antagonist**: a being whose every word, every gesture, quietly opposes the pursuit of the story goal.\\\n\\\n> John Smith does not obstruct with forceâ€”he **ensures**. His methods are not coercive, but *inevitable*. He does not demand compliance; he renders it unnecessary by removing all viable alternatives. His eyes smile, but they never blink. His hands are open, but they close around the world. Through passivity, prophecy, and mechanized causality, John Smith stands as the **antagonistic embodiment of destiny**â€”a force that gently steers all action *away* from change by asserting that everything has already been decided.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1228}]"
