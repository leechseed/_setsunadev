Speak and confirm:\\\n\\\n   * You see **input activity** and **output activity** meters moving inside the app.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 3 – Voicemeeter Routing\\\n\\\n### 3.1 If You Used Strategy A (VB-Cable)\\\n\\\nRealtime VC Output → `CABLE Input` → (`CABLE Output` appears in Voicemeeter)\\\n\\\n1. In **Voicemeeter**:\\\n\\\n   * Set **Hardware Input 1** (or any free hardware input) to:\\\n     `CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`\\\n2. On that input strip:\\\n\\\n   * Enable **B1** (or whichever B-bus you decided is your “Discord mic”).\\\n   * OPTIONAL: enable **A1** so you can hear yourself through your headphones.\\\n\\\nResult:\\\n**Processed voice from Realtime VC** now goes into Voicemeeter, then out via **B1**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.2 If You Used Strategy B (Direct to Voicemeeter VAIO/AUX)\\\n\\\nRealtime VC Output → `Voicemeeter VAIO` (or AUX)\\\n\\\n1. In **Voicemeeter**:\\\n\\\n   * Look at the **Virtual Input** strip labeled `Voicemeeter VAIO` (or AUX).\\\n   * This strip should now receive audio when you talk.\\\n2. On that virtual input strip:\\\n\\\n   * Enable **B1** (or your chosen B-bus).\\\n   * OPTIONAL: enable **A1** to monitor yourself.\\\n\\\nResult:\\\n**Processed voice from Realtime VC** hits the VAIO/AUX strip and is sent out via **B1**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.3 Make B1 the “Discord Mic”\\\n\\\nIn Voicemeeter:\\\n\\\n* Confirm at the top/right section that **B1** is mapped to:\\\n  `Voicemeeter Output (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)` or similar name.\\\n\\\nThis is what Discord will see as your microphone.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 4 – Discord Settings\\\n\\\nIn **Discord → User Settings → Voice & Video**:\\\n\\\n1. **Input Device**:\\\n\\\n   * Set to: `Voicemeeter Output (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)`\\\n     (or `Voicemeeter AUX Output` if you used AUX/B2).\\\n\\\n2. **Output Device**:\\\n\\\n   * Whatever you normally use to hear Discord (headphones, Voicemeeter, etc.).\\\n\\\n3. Under **Input Sensitivity**:\\\n\\\n   * Turn OFF “Automatically determine input sensitivity.”\\\n   * Set the slider so normal speech passes easily, but background noise does not cut in/out.\\\n\\\n4. Under **Advanced**:\\\n\\\n   * Echo cancellation, noise reduction, etc. may **distort AI voices**.\\\n   * If your voice sounds crushed or unstable, try disabling:\\\n\\\n     * Noise Suppression\\\n     * Echo Cancellation\\\n     * Automatic Gain Control\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 5 – Test & Fine-Tune\\\n\\\n1. In Discord:\\\n\\\n   * Use **“Let’s Check” / “Mic Test”** or join a private voice channel alone.\\\n2. Speak:\\\n\\\n   * Check meters in **Realtime Voice Changer → Voicemeeter → Discord**:\\\n\\\n     * Realtime VC: input + output meters move.\\\n     * Voicemeeter: chosen input strip shows signal; B1 bus shows signal.\\\n     * Discord: input level bar moves.\\\n3. Adjust:\\\n\\\n   * Use **Voicemeeter’s fader** on the AI input strip to set loudness.\\\n   * Do **NOT** crank Windows mic levels and Voicemeeter both to 100%; balance them.\\\n\\\nIf friends say you’re too loud/quiet:\\\n\\\n* Adjust the **strip fader in Voicemeeter**, not Discord input sensitivity.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Issues\\\n\\\n* **No sound in Discord, but Realtime VC works:**\\\n\\\n  * Check Voicemeeter:\\\n\\\n    * Is the correct input strip active (CABLE/VAIO)?\\\n    * Is **B1** lit on that strip?\\\n  * Check Discord:\\\n\\\n    * Input Device = **Voicemeeter Output**, not your raw mic or CABLE.\\\n\\\n* **You hear yourself twice / with echo:**\\\n\\\n  * Disable any **“Listen to this device”** in Windows Sound settings.\\\n  * Make sure only **ONE path** is monitoring to your headphones (e.g., just A1 from Voicemeeter).\\\n\\\n* **Latency feels bad:**\\\n\\\n  * Lower buffer sizes in Voicemeeter and Realtime VC **gradually** until you get crackling, then bump it slightly back up.\\\n  * Keep all sample rates consistent (e.g., 48 kHz everywhere).\\\n\\\n* **Friends say your voice is cutting in/out:**\\\n\\\n  * In Discord, loosen input sensitivity or disable noise suppression.\\\n  * Make sure your AI output isn’t too quiet before it hits Discord (raise in Voicemeeter).\\\n\\\nRVC git: fyi chinese dev https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI\\\n\\\nvoice models hugging face: https://huggingface.co/models?other=rvc&sort=downloads\\\n\\\nvoicemeeter: https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm\\\n\\\nvb audio (virtual audio cables): https://vb-audio.com/Cable/\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6373}]"
