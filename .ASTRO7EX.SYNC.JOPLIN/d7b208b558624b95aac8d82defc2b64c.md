Summary Overview\\\n\\\nThe Main Character Plot Progression for *ASTRO7EX* has now been fully illustrated. Across all four Signposts and three Journeys, **Vivian's subjective experience has been mapped from her immediate crisis to a final acceptance of metamorphic reality**. The development arc aligns tightly with the Dramatica Steadfast character model: Vivian does not transform in the conventional sense, but rather *deepens her understanding and endurance of change*. Each phase sharpens her perspective and forces her into a new temporal relationship with grief, identity, and collapse.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üß± 2. Signpost Breakdown\\\n\\\n### **MC Signpost 1 ‚Äî *The Present***\\\n\\\n* Vivian is caught in the aftermath of a failed heist and a corrupted world.\\\n* Her survival is moment-to-moment: food, oxygen, betrayal.\\\n* Anxiety, surveillance, and shellshock define her immediate concerns.\\\n\\\n### **MC Signpost 2 ‚Äî *The Past***\\\n\\\n* Flashbacks bleed into hallucination as Vivian revisits her MAXWING indoctrination.\\\n* Guilt and betrayal emerge as core themes‚Äîespecially around Penelope and Fiona.\\\n* The revelation that her memories may be implanted destabilizes her timeline.\\\n\\\n### **MC Signpost 3 ‚Äî *The Future***\\\n\\\n* She begins to anticipate the DHR countdown.\\\n* Not driven by hope, but by inevitability‚Äîshe contemplates extinction, legacy, prophecy.\\\n* Her vision of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù takes on spiritual and strategic dimensions.\\\n\\\n### **MC Signpost 4 ‚Äî *How Things Are Changing***\\\n\\\n* Vivian becomes a mirror of the world's transformation.\\\n* The climax isn‚Äôt in action but in *observation*‚Äîbearing witness as the system mutates.\\\n* She reaches peace with change, ambiguity, and her own unknowability.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üß≠ 3. Journey Breakdown\\\n\\\n### **MC Journey 1 ‚Äî *The Present ‚Üí The Past***\\\n\\\n* Vivian begins in stasis but is pulled backward by trauma and loss.\\\n* Her present paranoia cracks open repressed memories of indoctrination and war.\\\n* Symbolically: from hiding to unburying.\\\n\\\n### **MC Journey 2 ‚Äî *The Past ‚Üí The Future***\\\n\\\n* After breaking through her history, she starts thinking ahead‚Äînot in terms of goals, but timelines.\\\n* She maps prophetic paths, mythic blueprints, and the implications of the AI Collapse.\\\n* The dead no longer haunt‚Äîthey *warn*.\\\n\\\n### **MC Journey 3 ‚Äî *The Future ‚Üí How Things Are Changing***\\\n\\\n* She lets go of control or prediction.\\\n* Instead, she tracks transformation: of herself, her comrades, the MODS, and MORN.\\\n* Her subjective lens moves from *destination* to *direction*.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üß¨ 4. Thematic Integration\\\n\\\n* **Bloomian Tragedy**: Vivian echoes the tragic American hero who cannot escape the myth she‚Äôs embedded in.\\\n* **McKee‚Äôs Causality Model**: Reveals true character via **persistent response to irreversible collapse**, not epiphany.\\\n* **Astrology**: Progressions show internal weathering, not enlightenment. Transits shake but do not reform.\\\n* **2000s Anime**: Lain, Texhnolyze, and Ghost in the Shell ‚Äî characters who become vessels of systemic awareness.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üìê 5.
