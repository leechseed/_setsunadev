## 1. Overview

This report finalizes all major Dramatica **Storyforming decisions** for ASTRO7EX. These choices define the **objective structure**, thematic depth, and narrative pressure within which all story events unfold. They also anchor the protagonist Vivian's internal arc within the broader psychological, metaphysical, and genre-informed systems at play.

## 2. Main Character Dynamics â€” Vivian

| Category            | Selected Option     | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Resolve**         | Steadfast            | Vivian never changes her core nature; she holds out for meaning despite collapse.  
| **Growth**          | Stop                 | She waits for the recursive memory violence to end, not for something new to begin.  
| **Approach**        | Do-er                | Vivian acts before she reflects; her behavior is kinetic, reactive, and fueled by survival.  
| **Problem Solving Style** | Intuitive       | She navigates the world through psychic instinct, trauma-derived logic, and emotional radar.

## 3. Plot Dynamics

| Plot Dynamic        | Selection              | Explanation |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Story Driver**    | Actions force Decisions| External pressures (lobotomies, AI awakenings) drive character choices.  
| **Story Limit**     | Optionlock             | The story closes in as options disappearâ€”not as time runs out.  
| **Story Outcome**   | Failure                | The system is not destroyedâ€”but its truth is exposed.  
| **Story Judgment**  | Good                   | Vivian finds inner peace and reclaims meaningâ€”even if the world doesnâ€™t change.

## 4. Overall Story Domain + Concern

| Layer             | Selection            | Meaning |
|-------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| **Domain**        | Situation / Activity  | The world is stuck in a decaying structure (Situation) with scattered attempts at rebellion (Activity).  
| **Concern**       | The Past / Understanding / Doing | Characters are haunted by buried systems, struggle to comprehend what happened, and lash out in desperation.

---

## 5. Overall Story Thematic Issue

| Layer         | Issue         | Meaning |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| **Primary**   | Interpretation | All characters act based on differing interpretations of a corrupted reality.  
| **Secondary** | Conditioning   | Behavior is programmed by culture, code, trauma, and ritual.  
| **Tertiary**  | Fate/Destiny   | The system simulates destinyâ€”but only because no one resists.

---

## 6. Overall Story Problem

| Layer         | Problem        | Meaning |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **Primary**   | Inertia         | The system refuses to die; structures remain in place despite collapse.  
| **Secondary** | Order           | False stability is enforced to cover up decay.  
| **Tertiary**  | Awareness (symptom) | Awareness becomes dangerous under false paradigms of truth.

---

## 8. Status

âœ… **Step 2: Storyforming COMPLETE**

> ASTRO7EX is now structurally locked from a Dramatica standpoint. All character arcs, thematic pressures, and plot resolutions are fully integrated into a coherent narrative logic. This prepares us for **Step 3: Encoding**, where specific scenes, moments, and story beats are infused with meaning via these abstract storyform decisions.
