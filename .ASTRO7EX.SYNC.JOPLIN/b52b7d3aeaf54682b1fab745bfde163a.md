The biggest value jump grabs the eye first.  \\\n- **Edge** ‚Üí The transition between two shapes/values/colors.  \\\n- **Edge Sharpness** ‚Üí How quickly that transition happens. Razor-sharp edges command attention; soft edges recede.  \\\n- **Micro-contrast** ‚Üí Small, local value differences (pores, fabric texture). Adds ‚Äúcrunch.‚Äù  \\\n- **Macro-contrast** ‚Üí Big, global value differences (subject vs background). Defines the overall read.  \\\n- **Saturation** ‚Üí Color intensity. Highly saturated areas pull attention‚Äîuse sparingly near the focal.  \\\n- **Color Temperature** ‚Üí Warm (reds/oranges) vs cool (blues/cyans). Warm advances, cool recedes (generally).  \\\n- **Visual Weight** ‚Üí How strongly something attracts attention (size, value contrast, saturation, detail, warm hue, faces/text, sharpness).  \\\n- **Negative Space** ‚Üí The ‚Äúempty‚Äù area around subjects. Used to isolate and clarify.  \\\n- **Figure‚ÄìGround** ‚Üí Clear separation of subject (figure) from background (ground).  \\\n- **Notan** ‚Üí Simplified design reduced to 2‚Äì3 flat values (black/gray/white) to check readability.  \\\n- **Kissing Tangent** ‚Üí Edges barely touch or align awkwardly; flattens depth and creates confusion.  \\\n- **Occlusion** ‚Üí Intentional overlap; one object blocks another to show depth.  \\\n- **Leading Lines** ‚Üí Lines (real or implied) that steer the eye toward the subject.  \\\n- **Rim Light** ‚Üí Thin highlight on an edge that separates a form from its background.  \\\n- **Silhouette** ‚Üí The readable outer shape of a subject; must be clear for instant recognition.\\\n\\\n> If a term appears below that isn‚Äôt in this primer, it will be defined in the **Extended Glossary**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## How to Use This Guide\\\n- **Pick one** weak area to improve per piece (e.g., ‚Äúthis week = Values‚Äù).  \\\n- **Work top-down**: Macro (Hierarchy, Contrast) ‚Üí Meso (Balance, Flow) ‚Üí Micro (Edges, Texture).  \\\n- **Test constantly**: Flip, Squint, Blur, and 3-Value Notan while composing‚Äînot after.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## The 8 Core Principles\\\n\\\n### 3.1 Hierarchy\\\n**Definition**  \\\nDeliberate ordering of attention: **Primary ‚Üí Secondary ‚Üí Tertiary**. One clear winner first.\\\n\\\n**Controls**  \\\nClarity, speed of read, narrative priority.\\\n\\\n**Symptoms of failure**  \\\n- ‚ÄúEverything is loud.‚Äù  \\\n- Viewers ask ‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to look at?‚Äù\\\n\\\n**Design methods**  \\\n- **Crown the hero**: Give the focal area the largest **value contrast** *and* the **sharpest edges**.  \\\n- **Demote competitors**: Reduce saturation/detail/edge sharpness away from the focal.  \\\n- **Scale steps**: Use distinct size ratios (e.g., 1.0 ‚Üí 0.6 ‚Üí 0.35).  \\\n- **Isolation**: Carve **negative space** around the hero.\\\n\\\n**Quick fixes**  \\\n- Add a light-on-dark or dark-on-light junction at the hero.  \\\n- Soften/blur competing areas by 20‚Äì50%.  \\\n- Pull a subtle vignette to mute the periphery.\\\n\\\n**Context**\\\n- *Photo/Film*: Key + rim on subject; background one stop flatter.  \\\n- *Illustration*: Brightest accent and sharpest edge live at the eyes/hands.  \\\n- *UI*: Single primary CTA; all others clearly secondary.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Can a stranger name the subject in 1 second? If not, reassign value/edge priority.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.2 Balance\\\n**Definition**  \\\nDistribution of **visual weight**. Two modes: **Symmetry** (calm) vs **Asymmetry** (dynamic).\\\n\\\n**Controls**  \\\nMood (stable vs energetic), comfort vs tension.\\\n\\\n**Symptoms of failure**  \\\n- Frame feels lopsided; eye slides out on the heavy side.  \\\n- Unintended tilt.\\\n\\\n**Design methods**  \\\n- **Symmetry**: Center, level, clean verticals/horizons; embrace monumental calm.  \\\n- **Asymmetry**: Counter a **big dull mass** with a **small high-contrast accent**.  \\\n- Keep heavy stuff off the extreme edges unless you *want* tension.\\\n\\\n**Quick fixes**  \\\n- Crop or nudge masses toward equilibrium; add a bright counterweight.  \\\n- Straighten horizons/verticals.\\\n\\\n**Context**\\\n- *Architecture*: Dead-center fa√ßade, axes aligned.  \\\n- *Street*: Large shadow block balanced by small lit figure.  \\\n- *Poster*: Massive character balanced by small bright title block.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Squint: do left/right (or top/bottom) halves feel intentional?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.3 Contrast\\\n**Definition**  \\\nDifferences that hook attention: **Value (king)** ‚Üí **Edge** ‚Üí **Color** ‚Üí **Detail**.\\\n\\\n**Controls**  \\\nFirst read, separation, drama.\\\n\\\n**Symptoms of failure**  \\\n- Muddy midtones everywhere; subject merges with background.  \\\n- ‚ÄúFlat‚Äù image even with good color.\\\n\\\n**Design methods**  \\\n- Place the hero at the **highest value contrast** in the frame.  \\\n- **Edge strategy**: Sharp where you want attention, soft elsewhere.  \\\n- Reserve **saturation** and **micro-contrast** for the focal; keep background simple.\\\n\\\n**Quick fixes**  \\\n- Toggle grayscale; fix value design before color.  \\\n- Add rim light or dark halo to clarify **silhouette** (avoid glowing outlines).  \\\n- Drop background contrast locally around the hero.\\\n\\\n**Context**\\\n- *Product*: Specular edges define form; backdrop matte and neutral.  \\\n- *Concept art*: Fog the distance (low contrast), punch the subject (high contrast).\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Blur to 10‚Äì20 px: does the focal still pop? If no, rework values.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.4 Unity vs Variety\\\n**Definition**  \\\nCohesion (**unity**) with controlled differences (**variety**) so the image isn‚Äôt boring or chaotic.\\\n\\\n**Controls**  \\\nCoherence, style signature, ease of parsing.\\\n\\\n**Symptoms of failure**  \\\n- All parts different ‚Üí noise.  \\\n- All parts same ‚Üí monotony.\\\n\\\n**Design methods**  \\\n- Choose a **dominant family** (value range, hue range, shape language).  \\\n- Add **2‚Äì3 deliberate variations** near the focal (accent hue, unique texture, shape break).  \\\n- Use repetition-with-variation: echo motifs at smaller scales.\\\n\\\n**Quick fixes**  \\\n- Reduce hue spread; stick to one temperature family.  \\\n- Add a single accent (color/shape) at the focal; remove extras elsewhere.\\\n\\\n**Context**\\\n- *Landscape*: Cool unity with a warm sunlit accent.  \\\n- *UI*: One typeface family; hierarchy via size/weight, not random fonts.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Summarize the piece‚Äôs ‚Äúfamily‚Äù in one sentence; if you can‚Äôt, unify.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.5 Movement / Flow\\\n**Definition**  \\\nThe **path the eye travels** via lines, curves, light, and beats.\\\n\\\n**Controls**  \\\nPacing, narrative order, emotional feel (grace vs attack).\\\n\\\n**Symptoms of failure**  \\\n- Eye exits the frame fast; key beats get skipped; dead ends.\\\n\\\n**Design methods**  \\\n- **Leading lines** toward the hero (roads, gazes, arms, props).  \\\n- **S-curves/diagonals** for grace/energy; avoid parallel monotony.  \\\n- Place **stepping stones** (secondary beats) that march toward the focal.\\\n\\\n**Quick fixes**  \\\n- Add dark/light blockers at exit edges; bend lines back inward.  \\\n- Rotate/repose figures and props to point to the hero.\\\n\\\n**Context**\\\n- *Comics*: Z-pattern guides panel order; balloons reinforce flow.  \\\n- *Photography*: Shoreline arcs to lighthouse; clouds echo direction.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Trace the eye with your finger: does it land on the hero and loop back?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.6 Emphasis\\\n**Definition**  \\\nStacking multiple cues at one spot to create **punch** (value, edge, color, detail, isolation).\\\n\\\n**Controls**  \\\nImpact, memorability, message priority.\\\n\\\n**Symptoms of failure**  \\\n- ‚ÄúNice, but nothing stands out.‚Äù  \\\n- Background steals the show.\\\n\\\n**Design methods**  \\\n- **Stack signals** at the focal: sharpest edge + biggest value jump + richest micro-contrast.  \\\n- **Isolate** the subject with negative space; simplify the surround.  \\\n- Use **unique color** (only saturated warm in a sea of cool neutrals).\\\n\\\n**Quick fixes**  \\\n- Remove micro-contrast from non-essentials.  \\\n- Add a small specular/edge accent on the subject; mute nearby areas.\\\n\\\n**Context**\\\n- *Poster*: One saturated accent on a desaturated scene.  \\\n- *Portrait*: Catchlights and crisp lashes; hair/background softened.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Reduce to a 3-value Notan: does emphasis still read? If not, re-stage.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.7 Rhythm / Repetition\\\n**Definition**  \\\nPattern and cadence from repeated shapes/intervals with **variation**.\\\n\\\n**Controls**  \\\nCohesion, visual ‚Äúbeat,‚Äù forward motion.\\\n\\\n**Symptoms of failure**  \\\n- Even, mechanical spacing; or chaotic clustering with no cadence.\\\n\\\n**Design methods**  \\\n- Establish a **motif** (arches, triangles, circles). Repeat at smaller scales.  \\\n- Use **progression** (big ‚Üí medium ‚Üí small) and **irregular spacing** to feel natural.  \\\n- Align beats with flow so rhythm pushes toward the focal.\\\n\\\n**Quick fixes**  \\\n- Break perfect symmetry in the pattern; drop or shift one element.  \\\n- Remove one beat where spacing is too even.\\\n\\\n**Context**\\\n- *Architecture*: Colonnade rhythm funnels into doorway focal.  \\\n- *Landscape*: Fence posts diminishing into distance as tempo makers.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Can you ‚Äútap‚Äù the cadence that accelerates toward the subject? If not, adjust spacing.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3.8 Depth\\\n**Definition**  \\\nIllusion of space via planes, overlap, scale, perspective, atmosphere, and light.\\\n\\\n**Controls**  \\\nImmersion, realism, subject separation.\\\n\\\n**Symptoms of failure**  \\\n- Flat scene; **kissing tangents**; subject blends with background.\\\n\\\n**Design methods**  \\\n- Always aim for **Foreground / Midground / Background**.  \\\n- **Occlusion**: overlap shapes cleanly; avoid edge-kisses.  \\\n- **Atmospheric perspective**: distance = lighter, lower contrast, lower saturation.  \\\n- **Lighting**: Rim light separates; shadow mass unifies; keep a readable **silhouette**.\\\n\\\n**Quick fixes**  \\\n- Add a foreground silhouette or subtle vignette to create a near plane.  \\\n- Lift background blacks and desaturate by 10‚Äì30% to push it back.\\\n\\\n**Context**\\\n- *Film*: Haze + backlights for layers; extras as mid-plane texture.  \\\n- *Concept art*: Big foreground frame ‚Üí mid action ‚Üí distant landmark.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Can you label 3 planes instantly? If not, add overlap or value stepping.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Cross-Principle Triage (Fix Any Image in 60‚Äì90s)\\\n\\\n1. **Hierarchy** ‚Üí Boost value/edge at hero; demote competitors.  \\\n2. **Contrast** ‚Üí Check in grayscale; put the biggest value jump at the focal.  \\\n3. **Flow** ‚Üí Turn lines inward; add exit blockers.  \\\n4. **Balance** ‚Üí Add/relocate a counterweight; straighten tilt.  \\\n5. **Depth** ‚Üí Add foreground layer; push background with atmosphere.  \\\n6. **Unity/Variety** ‚Üí Commit to one palette/shape family; permit one accent.  \\\n7. **Emphasis** ‚Üí Stack cues (value, edge, detail) only at the hero.  \\\n8. **Rhythm** ‚Üí Break even spacing; step sizes toward focal.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Diagnostic Tests & Tools\\\n\\\n- **Squint Test** ‚Üí Reduces detail; checks **value** hierarchy quickly.  \\\n- **Grayscale Toggle** ‚Üí If the read dies in gray, color was doing the heavy lifting (bad sign).  \\\n- **Blur Test (10‚Äì20 px)** ‚Üí Ensures macro-read and focal survive without edges.  \\\n- **Flip Test (horizontal)** ‚Üí Reveals balance issues, tangents, awkward angles.  \\\n- **3-Value Notan** ‚Üí Force design into black/gray/white; fix readability there first.  \\\n- **Edge Audit** ‚Üí Mark the 5 sharpest edges; they should cluster at/near the focal.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Exercises That Build Skill Fast\\\n\\\n1. **Daily Thumbnails** (10‚Äì20, 2 min each) ‚Üí Explore Hierarchy/Flow before detail.  \\\n2. **Notan Studies** (3 values) ‚Üí From refs and masters; value design first.  \\\n3. **Tangent Hunt** ‚Üí Print; circle every kissing tangent; redraw to overlap or separate.  \\\n4. **One-Focal Drill** ‚Üí Make 3 comps where the focal is undeniable in 1 sec.  \\\n5. **Edge Control** ‚Üí Paint with only soft edges; then add 10 hard edges exactly where needed.  \\\n6. **Atmosphere Ramps** ‚Üí Practice pushing backgrounds back with value/saturation steps.  \\\n7. **Rhythm Lines** ‚Üí Lay beats that accelerate toward focal; adjust spacing until it ‚Äútaps.‚Äù\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)\\\n\\\n- **Golden-ratio worship** ‚Üí It‚Äôs a tool, not a religion. Cure: prioritize value design.  \\\n- **Centering by habit** ‚Üí Boredom. Cure: thirds/triangles/diagonals with intent.  \\\n- **Midtone soup** ‚Üí No value hierarchy. Cure: push lights/darks; define a Notan.  \\\n- **Kissing tangents** ‚Üí Flatness. Cure: occlude or separate decisively.  \\\n- **Busy backgrounds** ‚Üí Focal lost. Cure: desaturate/soften/simplify background.  \\\n- **Edge noise** ‚Üí Random crispness. Cure: hard edges only at focal, soft elsewhere.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Mini-Process: Compose on Purpose\\\n\\\n1. **Intent** ‚Üí Write the sentence: *‚ÄúThe viewer must see ____ first.‚Äù*  \\\n2. **Choose an armature** ‚Üí Thirds, triangle, diagonal, or spiral‚Äîjust one.  \\\n3. **Notan** ‚Üí Lock the 3-value design.  \\\n4. **Place the focal** ‚Üí Highest value contrast + sharpest edges live here.  \\\n5. **Flow** ‚Üí Lay leading lines/stepping stones toward the focal.  \\\n6. **Balance** ‚Üí Add counterweight; avoid edge heaviness.  \\\n7. **Depth** ‚Üí Fore/Mid/Back with atmosphere and occlusion.  \\\n8. **Edge & Color pass** ‚Üí Hardness and saturation concentrated at the focal.  \\\n9. **Diagnostics** ‚Üí Squint, grayscale, blur, flip. Fix what fails.  \\\n10. **Polish** ‚Üí Micro-contrast only where the eye should linger.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Extended Glossary\\\n\\\n- **Accent (Color/Value)** ‚Üí Localized spike in saturation or brightness to attract attention.  \\\n- **Ambient Occlusion (Art shorthand)** ‚Üí Soft darkening where forms meet; increases depth.  \\\n- **Atmospheric Perspective** ‚Üí Distant objects lose contrast/saturation and shift cooler/lighter.  \\\n- **Background Compression** ‚Üí Making background values cluster together to reduce noise.  \\\n- **Counterweight** ‚Üí A small but potent element (usually higher contrast/saturation) balancing a large mass.  \\\n- **Detail Hierarchy** ‚Üí Highest texture near focal; simplified elsewhere.  \\\n- **Dominant Family** ‚Üí The prevailing value range, hue range, or shape language that unifies a piece.  \\\n- **Edge (Hard/Soft/Lost)** ‚Üí Hard = abrupt; Soft = gradual; Lost = edge disappears into neighbor value.  \\\n- **Focal (Focal Area)** ‚Üí The intended first stop of the viewer‚Äôs eye.  \\\n- **Gesture (Visual)** ‚Üí Overall directional thrust of forms/figures.  \\\n- **Haloing (Bad)** ‚Üí Unnatural outline glow around subject; avoid except for subtle separation.  \\\n- **Local Value** ‚Üí Subject‚Äôs inherent value independent of light (e.g., black coat vs white shirt).  \\\n- **Negative Space (Active)** ‚Üí Intentional emptiness shaping the subject and controlling rhythm.  \\\n- **Occlusion** ‚Üí Overlap creating depth; the front form ‚Äúoccludes‚Äù the back.  \\\n- **Pictorial Depth** ‚Üí The 2D illusion of 3D space using planes, perspective, and atmosphere.  \\\n- **Silhouette** ‚Üí Recognizable outer contour; readability skyrockets with a clean silhouette.  \\\n- **Specular Highlight** ‚Üí Bright reflection on glossy surfaces; potent emphasis tool.  \\\n- **Stepping Stones** ‚Üí Secondary accents/beats arranged to lead to the focal.  \\\n- **Tangent (Kissing)** ‚Üí Two shapes/lines meet awkwardly; kills depth‚Äîseparate or overlap.  \\\n- **Value Key** ‚Üí Overall value ‚Äúmood‚Äù (high-key = light, low-key = dark, mid-key = midtones).  \\\n- **Vignette** ‚Üí Subtle edge darkening or softening to keep attention inside the frame.  \\\n- **Visual Weight** ‚Üí The combined pull of size, contrast, saturation, detail, warm hue, faces/text, sharpness.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n> Study these, run the tests, do the drills. You‚Äôll stop ‚Äúhoping‚Äù images work and start **making** them work‚Äîon purpose.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":16555}]"
