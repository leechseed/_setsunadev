Gives breathing room and prevents “walling them in.”\\\n- **Headroom / Footroom / Chinroom** → Space above the head / below the feet / below the chin. Too much = drifting; too little = cramped.\\\n- **Power Point** → High-payoff placement node (e.g., rule-of-thirds or phi grid intersections).\\\n- **Edge Tension** → Anxiety created when important shapes sit **too close** to borders; can be used intentionally.\\\n- **Kissing Tangent** → Subject edge barely touches another edge/shape; looks accidental and kills depth.\\\n- **Amputation (Crop at Joint)** → Cropping **exactly** at wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, neck—reads like a mistake.\\\n- **Bleed (Print)** → Artwork extends past the trim edge so there’s no white sliver after cutting. Typical: ~3 mm (≈1/8\\\").\\\n- **Safe Area (Screen/TV)** → Inner margin where text/logos won’t get cut off on devices. (Action-safe/title-safe; modern UIs still respect inner padding.)\\\n- **Gutter/Spine** → The fold/binding area in books/mags; don’t park faces or key details there.\\\n- **Object-fit: cover vs contain (Web)** → `cover` crops to fill; `contain` letterboxes to preserve the whole image.\\\n- **Visual Weight** → Attention pull from **size**, **value contrast**, **saturation**, **edge sharpness**, **detail**, **faces/text**, **warmth**.\\\n\\\n> Memorize: **Don’t crop at joints. Protect silhouettes. Leave room where the subject is going.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## How to Use This Guide\\\n- Decide **what the image is about** (one sentence). Place the subject to support that; crop to delete everything else.\\\n- Pick an **armature** (thirds/phi/diagonals) from the Grids guide; then enforce with **value contrast** and **edge control**.\\\n- Design borders like fences: **block exits**, keep **hot spots** inside, and **avoid tangents**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Strategy: Before You Place or Crop\\\n1. **Intent** → Write the single focal statement.\\\n2. **Include/Exclude List** → Three things you must show; three you will cut.\\\n3. **Format Choice** → Pick aspect ratio by story (square = icon/monument, 16:9 = environment, 4:5 = vertical presence).\\\n4. **Armature** → Thirds for safety, diagonals for energy, spiral for a guided reveal.\\\n5. **Test Crop** → Make brutal crops early (50%, 25%) just to see what still reads. Then rebuild purposefully.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Subject Placement — Rules that Actually Help\\\n\\\n### 4.1 Centering with Intent\\\n**Use when**  \\\nIconic, confrontational, symmetrical, or ritual scenes.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Center **and** level; make the subject **heaviest** (value/edge).  \\\n- Add micro-asymmetry (pose, accent color) so it isn’t sterile.\\\n\\\n**Fix if boring**  \\\n- Shift to **near-symmetry** (tiny offset), or switch to a **diagonal** armature.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Is the center **earned** with hierarchy (brightest/ sharpest at the subject)?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.2 Power-Point Placement (Thirds / Phi)\\\n**Use when**  \\\nYou want balanced, natural tension without centering.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Put the focal near a **node**; align horizon or key edges to a grid line.  \\\n- Counterbalance with a smaller, hotter accent on the opposing line.\\\n\\\n**Fix if generic**  \\\n- Push farther from center or lean into **diagonals** to add energy.  \\\n- Remember **values** still determine first read.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Is the node-backed subject **also** the strongest value contrast?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.3 Lead Room / Look Room / Walk Room\\\n**Use when**  \\\nSubjects face or move laterally. The viewer expects space **ahead** of them.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Leave more space **in front** than behind.  \\\n- For fast motion, increase walk room; for contemplative poses, reduce.\\\n\\\n**Fix if cramped**  \\\n- Recompose/crop to add breathing room in front; reduce clutter there.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Does the subject feel like they can **breathe** in their direction of travel?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.4 Headroom, Footroom, and Chinroom\\\n**Use when**  \\\nPortraits and full-body frames.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Eyes near the **upper third** for portraits.  \\\n- Don’t crowd the chin; keep **chinroom** so the jawline reads.  \\\n- For full-length, give **footroom** to avoid toe amputation.\\\n\\\n**Fix if floaty**  \\\n- Reduce headroom or add a **foreground base** (desk, step) to ground them.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Are head/chin/feet clear with intentional spacing?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.5 Horizon Management Around People\\\n**Use when**  \\\nOutdoor scenes, urban frames, seascapes.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Keep horizons **off** necks/jaws; either **above the head** or **below the shoulders**.  \\\n- Use horizon to control **power** (low horizon = sky/heroic; high horizon = ground/anchored).\\\n\\\n**Fix if spearing**  \\\n- Raise/lower the camera or the person; protect the silhouette.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Is the silhouette clean from horizon mergers?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.6 Foreground Anchors & Separation\\\n**Use when**  \\\nYou want depth and a guided entry.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Place a **dark/soft** near object as an entry anchor.  \\\n- Ensure **value separation** between foreground and subject; avoid kissing tangents.\\\n\\\n**Fix if messy**  \\\n- Simplify the anchor (softer edge, lower detail) or shift it to clear the subject’s contour.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Does the anchor **lead to** (not fight) the subject?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.7 Groups & Multi-Subject Placement\\\n**Use when**  \\\nTrios, teams, crowds.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Build **triangles/pyramids**; designate a leader (value/edge/height).  \\\n- Stagger heads (no perfect rows); protect **face silhouettes** from mergers.\\\n\\\n**Fix if chaotic**  \\\n- Reduce one person’s contrast/detail; increase spacing around the leader’s face.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Can you identify the leader in under a second?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4.8 Product/Still-Life Orientation & Label Bias\\\n**Use when**  \\\nProducts must read quickly.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Angle objects to reveal **form** (3/4 view) and **label** flat-on where possible.  \\\n- Give hero product more **area** and **contrast**; supporting items echo shape/scale.\\\n\\\n**Fix if confusing**  \\\n- Rotate to clarify the **primary face**; simplify background texture.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Can a stranger read the brand/feature instantly?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Cropping — The Discipline\\\n\\\n### 5.1 Safe vs. Dangerous Crop Lines (Portraits)\\\n**Safe zones**  \\\n- Mid-forehead, above the eyebrow, mid-upper arm, **mid-thigh**, mid-calf.  \\\n- Cropping a bit into hair or off the top of the head is fine.\\\n\\\n**Danger zones (avoid)**  \\\n- **Neck**, **chin**, **wrists**, **elbows**, **knees**, **ankles**, **fingers/toes**.  \\\n- Exact joint crops look like accidents.\\\n\\\n**Fixes**  \\\n- Move in/out by a few inches to land in a **safe zone**.  \\\n- If you must crop at a joint, **over-crop decisively** to make it stylized.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5.2 Action Crops (Speed, Power, Direction)\\\n**Use when**  \\\nSports, dance, wildlife, vehicles.\\\n\\\n**How**  \\\n- Leave extra **walk room**; crop **behind** the motion, not ahead.  \\\n- Consider dynamic **diagonal** crops; blur background to sell speed.\\\n\\\n**Fix if sluggish**  \\\n- Tighten the trailing edge; increase lead room; add motion blur.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Does the crop amplify direction and speed?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5.3 Edge Discipline: Tangents, Kisses, and Exits\\\n**What to avoid**  \\\n- Subject edges barely **touching** borders or other shapes.  \\\n- Bright/sharp corners that **pull out** the eye.\\\n\\\n**How to fix**  \\\n- **Commit**: bring the crop in tighter or give more air.  \\\n- Darken/soften corners; add **blockers** or vignettes to keep the eye in.\\\n\\\n**Checklist**  \\\n- Any near-misses at borders? Fix them now.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5.4 Aspect Ratio Choices & Re-Crops\\\n**Guidance**  \\\n- **1:1 (Square)** → Iconic, centered power, tight negative space.  \\\n- **4:5 / 5:4** → Vertical presence (portraits, posters).  \\\n- **3:2 / 4:3** → Versatile classics (photo-native).  \\\n- **16:9** → Cinematic breadth; watch empty flanks.  \\\n- **2.39:1** → Panoramic; design along **diagonals** and anchor multiple beats.\\\n\\\n**Re-cropping**  \\\n- Anchor the **focal** so it survives **all** target ratios.  \\\n- Save **alt crops** for vertical/horizontal deliverables; don’t rely on auto-crop.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5.5 Print vs Screen: Bleed, Safe Areas, and Gutter\\\n**Print**  \\\n- Add **bleed** (~3 mm / 1/8\\\") around edges if color/image runs to the trim.  \\\n- Keep text/logos inside **safe margin** (at least 4–6 mm / ~1/4\\\").  \\\n- Avoid faces/critical details in the **gutter/spine**.\\\n\\\n**Screen/Video**  \\\n- Respect **inner padding** for copy and UI (title-safe mindset).  \\\n- Test on multiple devices/aspect ratios; watch notch/rounded-corner cutouts.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5.6 Responsive/Adaptive Cropping (Web & Apps)\\\n**Principles**  \\\n- Declare the **focal point** (metadata or art-direction crops).  \\\n- Prefer **art-directed variants** over blind `object-fit: cover`.\\\n\\\n**Tactics**  \\\n- For hero images: provide **desktop 16:9**, **tablet 4:3**, **mobile 4:5/1:1** versions.  \\\n- Keep text out of the **outer 10–15%** on all sides unless you control the container.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Diagnostics & Stress Tests\\\n- **1-Second Read** → Can a stranger name the subject instantly? If not, your placement/crop failed.\\\n- **Border Patrol** → Scan edges for near-misses, tangents, hot corners. Fix or re-crop.\\\n- **Lead-Room Check** → For faces/motion, is there space **ahead**? If not, shift.\\\n- **Silhouette Pass** → Toggle to silhouette/Notan; if the subject merges, add separation or crop to isolate.\\\n- **Alt-Ratio Preview** → Mock 1:1, 4:5, 16:9 crops. Does the focal survive all?\\\n- **Flip Test** → Horizontal flip; lopsided headroom/lead-room jumps out.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Exercises That Build Skill Fast\\\n1. **Joint-Safe Portrait Set**  \\\n   - Shoot/paint 6 crops of one subject hitting only **safe zones**. Compare readability.\\\n\\\n2. **Lead-Room Ladder**  \\\n   - Make 5 frames of a moving subject with increasing lead room. Pick the snap point where speed feels right.\\\n\\\n3. **Edge Kill**  \\\n   - Take a “tangent-y” image; produce **two** fixes: tighter decisive crop vs looser air crop. Annotate why one wins.\\\n\\\n4. **Alt-Ratio Pack**  \\\n   - Deliver one scene in **1:1**, **4:5**, **16:9**, **2.39:1**. Maintain the same focal and flow.\\\n\\\n5. **Gutter Awareness**  \\\n   - Design a two-page spread; move the hero face away from the **spine**; test readability when folded.\\\n\\\n6. **Web Art-Direction**  \\\n   - Export desktop/tablet/mobile crops with consistent focal anchoring; test with `cover` vs designed variants.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)\\\n- **Cropping at Joints** → Looks like a mistake.  \\\n  *Cure*: Move to mid-limb or over-crop decisively.\\\n\\\n- **No Lead Room** → Subject suffocates.  \\\n  *Cure*: Add space in front; tighten the trailing side.\\\n\\\n- **Horizon Through Heads** → Kills silhouette.  \\\n  *Cure*: Shift horizon up/down.\\\n\\\n- **Hot Corners** → Eye exits.  \\\n  *Cure*: Darken/soften; add blockers; crop in.\\\n\\\n- **Centering by Habit** → Boring.  \\\n  *Cure*: Use power points or diagonals—center only when it serves the message.\\\n\\\n- **Auto-Crop Casualties** → Focal cut off on mobile.  \\\n  *Cure*: Art-direct multiple aspect ratios; define focal metadata.\\\n\\\n- **Edge Kisses** → Accidental tension.  \\\n  *Cure*: Commit tighter or give air; never “almost.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Workflow & Setup (Overlays, Tools, Camera Habits)\\\n- **Overlays**: Thirds/phi grids, diagonal armatures, **safe-area** guides, alt-ratio masks (1:1, 4:5, 16:9, 2.39:1).\\\n- **Software**:  \\\n  - Photoshop/Krita: make a **Crop Presets** set with overlay toggles; save **alt artboards** per ratio.  \\\n  - Figma/Sketch: components with **safe paddings**; variants per breakpoint.  \\\n  - InDesign: master pages with **bleed/safe** and **gutter** reminders.\\\n- **Camera Habits**:  \\\n  - Shoot **wider** than needed when deliverables are unknown (gives crop room).  \\\n  - Level horizons unless intentionally Dutch.  \\\n  - Watch borders in-frame; recompose **before** pressing the shutter.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Cheat Sheet Summary\\\n- Placement: **power point or diagonal** unless the center is **earned**.  \\\n- Cropping: **don’t crop at joints**, protect silhouettes, **leave lead room**.  \\\n- Borders are design tools: avoid tangents, block exits, tame hot corners.  \\\n- Pick aspect ratio for the **story**, export **alt crops** for platforms.  \\\n- Values/edges still trump: the subject must be the **highest-contrast, sharpest** area no matter the crop.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Extended Glossary\\\n- **Action-Safe / Title-Safe** → Inner zones where motion graphics/text won’t be cut off on displays; apply the idea as generous UI padding.  \\\n- **Amputation** → An unintentional crop through a limb/joint—reads as error.  \\\n- **Bleed** → Extra image past trim so print edges go to color; trimmed off after print.  \\\n- **Chinroom** → Space below the chin so jawline reads cleanly.  \\\n- **Edge Tension** → Psychological pull near borders; good for drama, bad when accidental.  \\\n- **Gutter / Spine** → Binding area where content can disappear; avoid placing focal elements here.  \\\n- **Headroom / Footroom** → Space above head / below feet; controls comfort and grounding.  \\\n- **Kissing Tangent** → Edges barely touch; destroys depth/clarity.  \\\n- **Lead Room / Look Room / Walk Room** → Space ahead of gaze/motion to imply future path.  \\\n- **Power Point** → High-value placement node from grids (thirds/phi).  \\\n- **Safe Area** → Inner margin for text/logos to avoid clipping or notch/rounded-corner loss.  \\\n- **Silhouette** → The outer contour; must stay readable against background.  \\\n- **Visual Weight** → Combined pull of size, value contrast, saturation, edge sharpness, detail, faces/text, and warmth.  \\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":15748}]"
