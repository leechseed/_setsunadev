MCDP 1-1 — Strategy (Knowledgebase Summary)

# MCDP 1-1 — Strategy (Knowledgebase Summary)

## Abstract
MCDP 1-1 teaches strategy as disciplined thought under political constraint. Strategy is both a process and a product: it interrelates ends and means, and it yields a way of using means to achieve political ends. Strategic success—not tactical brilliance—is the proper measure. War serves policy. A faulty strategy can waste victory; tactical excellence cannot redeem strategic failure. Marines may not author national strategy, but they execute actions with strategic consequences. They must therefore understand the strategic environment, the relationship of ends and means, the recurring strategic opposites that frame real choices, and the hazards that routinely corrupt strategy-making.

## TL;DR
- Strategy is the interrelation of **ends and means**; it is both a **process** and a **product**.
- War serves policy; therefore **strategic success** is the standard, not tactical performance.
- The strategic environment is complex, but not unknowable; **strategic constants and norms** provide a point of departure.
- Ends must be matched to means; when the match fails, either the ends or the means must change.
- Strategy is interactive; it is formed against an opponent and inside political limits.
- Strategic choices often appear as **opposites** (offense/defense, symmetrical/asymmetrical, deterrence by denial/reprisal, etc.).
- Strategy-making is constrained by moral criteria (e.g., just war) and undermined by recurring pitfalls (panaceas, process worship, fait accompli, paralysis vs recklessness).
- There is no mechanical substitute for judgment; education and contemplation remain essential.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### Foreword
- Purpose: provide Marines a common understanding of military strategy and the thinking required to examine political and military factors.
- Limits: not a solver for current problems, not a description of current U.S. strategy, not a checklist of techniques; it is education for self-education.
- Structure preview: strategic environment; ends and means; strategic opposites; the making of strategy.

### Introduction — The Study of Strategy
- War serves policy; therefore the correct standard is strategic success. Tactical excellence can be wasted by faulty strategy.
- Marines must understand strategy because they support senior decisionmakers, must explain purpose and constraints, and act in a world where actions can have immediate strategic implications.
- Modern visibility compresses the distance between battlefield action and strategic consequence.

### Chapter 1 — The Strategic Environment
- Strategy is made in a political environment shaped by rational intent and by forces that do not submit to neat calculation.
- The environment is complex, but not wholly unique each time. Strategic constants and norms provide footing for analysis.

#### Strategic Constants and Norms
- Constants and norms describe the “normal” patterns of strategic situations; they are the point of departure for analysis even in turbulence.

#### The Physical Environment
- Geography, resources, distances, lines of communication, and spatial relationships impose enduring constraints and opportunities. Strategy must make nature work for us.

#### National Character
- National character changes slowly and shapes predictable tendencies in policy and war. It influences what a state is willing and able to do.

#### Clausewitz’s Trinity
- Strategy must contend with three forces: people/emotion, chance and commanders, and government/policy. Ignoring any one produces theory divorced from reality.

### Chapter 2 — Strategy: Ends and Means
- Strategy links political ends to available means. It is both thinking and output.
- Ends and means constrain each other. When they do not match, strategy must change or it will fail.

#### Strategy Defined
- Strategy is the process of interrelating ends and means; the product is the resulting way of using means to achieve ends.

#### Ends
- Ends are political objectives. War’s aims are political by definition.

#### Means
- Means include instruments of power, time, information, will, alliances, and force; strategy chooses how they will be used to achieve ends.

#### National Strategy and Military Strategy
- Military strategy is subordinate to national strategy. National strategy coordinates instruments of national power (and force) to secure policy objectives.

### Chapter 3 — Strategic Opposites
- Many strategic decisions are best understood as opposites: offense/defense; symmetrical/asymmetrical; deterrence by denial/reprisal; standardized/tailored; strategy by intent/by default; and the evaluation of opposing strategies.
- Strategy is interactive. Choices are made against an adversary’s choices, not in isolation.

### Chapter 4 — The Making of Strategy
- Strategy-making is a practical discipline: assessment, objectives, means, strategic concepts, and the roles of those who make strategy.
- Strategy-making is constrained by moral criteria and undermined by recurring pitfalls.

#### Moral Criteria
- Strategy is not value-neutral. Just war considerations and moral constraints shape what is acceptable and sustainable.

#### Pitfalls
- Common failure modes include panaceas, mistaking process for product, fait accompli thinking, confusion about limited vs unlimited war, and the swing between paralysis and recklessness.

### Conclusion
- Marines must understand strategic context to interpret constraints (such as ROE), to advise leaders, and to avoid actions that damage national interests—without becoming timid.
- No system replaces judgment. Education, experience, and continual contemplation remain essential.
- The requirement is thinking Marines capable of acting with strategic awareness.

## Mental Models

### Model 1 — Ends–Means Fit
- **Model:** Strategy is the fit between political ends and available means.
- **Use:** When the fit fails, change the ends, change the means, or accept failure.

### Model 2 — Climate vs Weather
- **Model:** The strategic environment is turbulent, but constants and norms provide a stable point of departure for analysis.
- **Use:** Establish the baseline first; then interpret events against it.

### Model 3 — The Clausewitz Trinity
- **Model:** Strategy operates within the field created by people/emotion, chance/commanders, and government/policy.
- **Use:** Any plan that assumes away one element is already unsound.

### Model 4 — Opposites as Decision Frames
- **Model:** Many strategic choices are competing logics, not minor adjustments.
- **Use:** Identify the real pair of opposites before selecting a course.

### Model 5 — The Short Distance
- **Model:** Tactical acts can yield strategic effects rapidly under modern observation.
- **Use:** Anticipate second-order effects without surrendering initiative.

## Argument Map
- **Claim 1:** War serves policy; therefore strategic success is the proper measure.
  - **Therefore:** Tactical brilliance can be squandered by poor strategy.
- **Claim 2:** Strategy is the disciplined interrelation of ends and means, as process and product.
  - **Therefore:** Strategy demands continuous adjustment when ends and means diverge.
- **Claim 3:** The strategic environment is complex but analyzable through constants and norms, physical conditions, national character, and the trinity.
  - **Therefore:** Strategy begins with context and constraint, not with preferred tactics.
- **Claim 4:** Strategy-making is vulnerable to predictable pitfalls and bounded by moral criteria.
  - **Therefore:** No mechanical process guarantees sound strategy; judgment and education are indispensable.
- **Conclusion:** Marines must think strategically in execution because actions can carry immediate political and strategic consequence.

- **Strategic Environment:** The political field in which rational intent interacts with forces not fully reducible to calculation.
- **Strategic Constants and Norms:** Recurring elements of strategic situations that provide a baseline for analysis.
- **Physical Environment:** Geography, resources, distances, and lines of communication that constrain and enable strategy.
- **National Character:** Slow-changing traits that shape typical strategic behavior and preferences.
- **Clausewitz Trinity:** People/emotion, chance/commanders, and government/policy—forces always present in war and strategy.
- **National Strategy:** The coordination of instruments of national power (and force) to secure policy objectives.
- **Military Strategy:** The employment of armed forces to secure national policy objectives through force or threat of force.
