body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# PROLOGUE STORYFORM — EPISODE 2\\\n**Working Title:** The Ancient Wallet Job  \\\n**Function:** Shift from street-level survival to *manipulation & planning*; install MODS as the standing IC force; light the DHR countdown that Ep. 3 must execute against.\\\n\\\n## Story Dynamics\\\n- **Driver:** Action → a chain-analysis sweep and MODS audit hit first; choices follow\\\n- **Limit:** Timelock → a DHR “heartbeat” ping initializes a silent countdown window\\\n- **Outcome:** Success → the heist architecture is conceived and a lead secured\\\n- **Judgment:** Bad → personal cost deepens; trust corrodes; lines blur\\\n- **MC Resolve/Growth/Approach/Style:** Steadfast • Stop • Do-er • Linear\\\n\\\n## Throughlines\\\n\\\n### Overall Story (OS)\\\n- **Domain:** Psychology (Manipulation)\\\n- **Concern:** Conceptualizing (engineering the wallet-recovery schema)\\\n- **Issue:** State of Being vs. Sense of Self\\\n- **Problem / Solution:** **Avoid** → **Pursuit**\\\n- **Symptom / Response:** **Support** ↔ **Oppose**\\\n- **Goal:** Design a viable plan to recover an *ancient* bitcoin wallet (custody unknown)\\\n- **Consequence:** Being co-opted into MODS compliance (becoming part of the protocol)\\\n- **Requirements:** Cold-read the custody chain; map air-gapped routes; recruit a clean “front”; procure **analog failsafes** (Faraday crates, mu-metal sleeves, wind-up timelocks, burner paper keys); seed dead-drops; secure a non-digital rendezvous\\\n- **Forewarnings:** Prototype plans collapse under surveillance; “dust” transactions tag their scouts; port scanners cross-index aliases; quiet arrests nearby\\\n- **Catalyst / Inhibitor:** Responsibility / Commitment\\\n- **Benchmark:** Becoming (crew “becomes” criminals, martyrs… or ghosts)\\\n\\\n### Main Character (MC) — *Vivian*\\\n- **Domain:** Universe (Situation) — semi-legit now, but paperless past lingers; resources scarce\\\n- **Concern:** Present (exposure today; thin margins; watchlists)\\\n- **Issue:** Openness vs. Prejudice\\\n- **Problem / Solution:** **Uncontrolled** → **Control**\\\n- **Unique Ability:** Approach (decisive, analog-first gambits that reduce digital surface)\\\n- **Critical Flaw:** Attitude (contempt for gatekeepers poisons alliances)\\\n\\\n### Impact Character (IC) — *MODS* (the System)\\\n- **Domain:** Mind (Fixed Attitude) — encoded refusal to change; “truth = protocol”\\\n- **Concern:** Memory (immutable logs; audit trails; retroactive guilt)\\\n- **Issue:** Closure vs. Denial\\\n- **Problem / Solution:** **Non-Accurate** → **Accurate**  \\\n  *(their brittle exactness exposes itself when reality won’t fit the ledger)*\\\n- **IC Function:** Reframe definitions; nullify premises; force submission to record\\\n\\\n### Relationship (RS) — *Vivian ↔ MODS*\\\n- **Domain:** Physics (Activity)\\\n- **Concern:** Obtaining (access, keys, clearances, physical custody)\\\n- **Issue:** Morality vs. Self-Interest\\\n- **Problem / Solution:** **Hinder** → **Help**\\\n- **Benchmark:** Doing (workarounds, analog rituals, dirty ops)\\\n\\\n## Plot Progressions (Signposts → brief beats)\\\n\\\n### OS (Psychology / Conceiving → Being → Becoming → Conceptualizing)\\\n1. **Conceiving:** A rumor surfaces: a “dead” wallet address signs a heartbeat—DHR pings; Vivian senses legacy money and leverage.  \\\n2. **Being:** They don roles—broker, archivist, janitor—run social-engineering passes; MODS policy nodes keep “politely” denying premises.  \\\n3. **Becoming:** Masks stick; a crew member compromises a value; Vivian trims the roster to reduce attack surface.  \\\n4. **Conceptualizing:** Under pressure, an analog-heavy heist design “clicks”: shard retrieval via off-grid relays, paper key splits, Faraday handoff.\\\n\\\n### MC (Universe / Past → Progress → Present → Future)\\\n1. **Past:** She weaponizes the E1 abandonment—no more naïve permissions; only results.  \\\n2. **Progress:** Scavenged intel improves… until a surveillance brushback freezes their digital leads.  \\\n3. **Present:** Pinpoint the live window before DHR recycles; pick the city-to-coast corridor with lowest scanner density.  \\\n4. **Future:** She accepts the cost: burning covers and maybe people—to move this plan into action.\\\n\\\n### IC (Mind / Memory → Conscious → Preconscious → Subconscious)\\\n1. **Memory:** MODS cites immutable logs to deny provenance and travel; “records disagree.”  \\\n2. **Conscious:** Their “concerns” are policy flags masquerading as ethics; they stall with procedure.  \\\n3. **Preconscious:** Auto-blocks fire mid-call; silent throttling; keyphrases trigger denies without human review.  \\\n4. **Subconscious:** Bedrock motive revealed: *stasis* (no change, no exception, no precedent).\\\n\\\n### RS (Physics / Learning → Understanding → Doing → Obtaining)\\\n1. **Learning:** Vivian maps how to “talk around” the protocol—never assert, only imply.  \\\n2. **Understanding:** She realizes **silence** is MODS’ weapon; absence of reply is the ruling.  \\\n3. **Doing:** She builds an **analog ritual**: pre-agreed knocks, paper seals, wind-up clocks, windowed drop sites.  \\\n4. **Obtaining:** First shard of access is secured in meatspace—proof the ritual can beat the record.\\\n\\\n## Bridge to Ep. 3\\\n- **Flip to OS: Physics (Activity):** the plan *must* be executed now—live runs, moving parts.  \\\n- **Standing IC:** MODS escalate from audits to interdiction; they’re the wall Ep. 3 slams against.  \\\n- **Countdown Lit:** The DHR clock is running; with one shard in hand and the route charted, Ep. 3 opens mid-motion under **Understanding/Conditioning** pressure.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5369}]"
