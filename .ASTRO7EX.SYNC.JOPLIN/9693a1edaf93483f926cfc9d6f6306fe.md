An AI that assimilates organic life for the sake of binary efficiency. So what this neutrino trap does is that its timed specifically with three pulsars. rapidly spinning stars or whatever. And when it is disrupted, that secret xenospecies that saved humanity, activates a failsafe where like idk cool artifiacts can be found around the world to hold back the borg while the aliens hopefully come to help. The idea is that cherub cannot be destroyed. It can only be hidden. The future aliens are actually a race of perfect human clones. The same person just over and over again .Like Horatio from that Paradox game.\\\n\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":4139,\"start2\":4139,\"length1\":12,\"length2\":752}]"
