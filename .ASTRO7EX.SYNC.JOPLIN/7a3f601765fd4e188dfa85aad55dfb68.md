Justice / Power / Legitimacy\\\n  - Idealism / Corruption / Survival\\\n  - Law / Violence / Consensus\\\n\\\n### Six-Force Systems\\\n- Two triads stacked\\\n- Used for:\\\n  - large IPs\\\n  - multi-season arcs\\\n  - institutional narratives\\\n- Creates **orthogonal pressure**, not simple opposition\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Mental Models Used\\\n\\\n### Fractals\\\n- The same invariant must appear at every scale\\\n- Sentence → Scene → Arc → World\\\n\\\n### Systems Persistence\\\n- Systems do not fail because they are evil\\\n- They persist because they are **self-reinforcing**\\\n\\\n### Wicked Problems\\\n- No clean solutions\\\n- Every “fix” produces new harm\\\n- Justice cannot be finalized\\\n\\\n### Constraint-First Design\\\n- Meaning emerges from limits\\\n- Freedom without constraint dissolves coherence\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Process Breakdown (Replicable)\\\n\\\nThis is the **exact process**, expressed as steps:\\\n\\\n1. **Observe Reality Honestly**\\\n   - Identify what *actually happens*, not what should\\\n   - Example: “People in power get away with it”\\\n\\\n2. **Reject Moral Fantasy**\\\n   - Do not assume fairness, balance, or cosmic justice\\\n\\\n3. **Identify Persistent Forces**\\\n   - What keeps recurring no matter who is in charge?\\\n\\\n4. **Create Polarity**\\\n   - Force A vs Force B (they cannot both win)\\\n\\\n5. **Stabilize with a Third Force**\\\n   - What mediates, distorts, or legitimizes the conflict?\\\n\\\n6. **Stress-Test Across Scale**\\\n   - Dialogue\\\n   - Individual behavior\\\n   - Institutions\\\n   - History\\\n\\\n7. **Decide on System Size**\\\n   - Triad if focused\\\n   - Six-force if expansive\\\n\\\n8. **Lock as Non-Negotiable**\\\n   - No exceptions\\\n   - No “but this time”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Triads vs Six-Force Systems\\\n\\\n### Triads\\\n- Cleaner\\\n- Strong thematic clarity\\\n- Easier to maintain\\\n- Higher stability\\\n\\\n### Six-Force Systems\\\n- Higher expressive power\\\n- Better for institutional decay\\\n- More failure modes\\\n- Requires active governance\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Stability Ranking Logic\\\n\\\nFrom **most stable** to **most volatile**:\\\n\\\n1. **Single Invariant**\\\n   - Maximum clarity\\\n   - Minimal expressive range\\\n\\\n2. **Triad**\\\n   - Optimal balance of meaning and motion\\\n   - Best default choice\\\n\\\n3. **Six-Force System**\\\n   - Powerful but fragile\\\n   - Requires discipline and enforcement\\\n\\\nUnmanaged six-force systems collapse into noise.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## When to Use Which Structure\\\n\\\n- **Short work / single arc** → Triad\\\n- **Multi-season IP** → Six-Force\\\n- **Institutional critique** → Six-Force\\\n- **Character-driven tragedy** → Triad\\\n- **Mythic allegory** → Triad\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Deliverable Output of the Method\\\n\\\nWhen applied correctly, the method yields:\\\n\\\n- A fixed set of **Non-Negotiable Invariants**\\\n- A polarity map\\\n- Either:\\\n  - one triad, or\\\n  - two stacked triads\\\n- A kill-filter for ideas\\\n- Coherence across scale\\\n- A system that does not lie about reality\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Prompt Handoff for Continuation\\\n\\\nUse the following verbatim to continue work in a new system or model:\\\n\\\n> You are continuing the development of a **Six-Force Invariant System** for narrative and systems design.  \\\n>  \\\n> The method is constraint-first, polarity-driven, and scale-tested.  \\\n>  \\\n> Do NOT introduce genre tropes, hero’s journeys, or moral resolutions.  \\\n>  \\\n> Your task is to:\\\n> 1. Propose candidate triads\\\n> 2. Rank them by stability\\\n> 3. Test them across scale\\\n> 4. Recommend whether a triad or six-force system is optimal\\\n> 5. Enforce non-negotiability  \\\n>  \\\n> Assumptions:\\\n> - Justice is expected to fail\\\n> - Systems persist through self-reinforcement\\\n> - Meaning emerges from constraint, not resolution\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5876}]"
