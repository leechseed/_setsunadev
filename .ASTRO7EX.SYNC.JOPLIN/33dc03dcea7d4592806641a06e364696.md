[Quick Start Checklist](#quick-start-checklist)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Purpose\\\nGive you a **hard, practical governance mechanism** for creative work at any scale—dialogue line, scene, arc, season, entire world—without pretending the domain isn’t wicked and chaotic.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Core Concept\\\n**Invariants** are **constraints on meaning** that must remain true across every scale of the IP:\\\n- True in a **line of dialogue**\\\n- True in a **character arc**\\\n- True in the **world history**\\\n- True in the **systems** (economy, politics, tech, religion, violence, institutions)\\\n\\\nIf an idea violates an invariant, it dies—even if it’s cool.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Step 1 — Define Your Non-Negotiable Invariants (3–5)\\\n### Rules\\\n- Max **3–5**. If you write 12, you wrote “preferences,” not invariants.\\\n- They are **not lore facts** (“the city has 7 districts”).\\\n- They are **meaning constraints** (“power always has a cost”).\\\n- Each invariant must be:\\\n  - **Speakable** (can appear as dialogue)\\\n  - **Playable** (can shape choices/actions)\\\n  - **Historical** (can explain why the world became what it is)\\\n  - **Systemic** (creates feedback loops and consequences)\\\n\\\n### Example Invariant Formats\\\n- “Power always has a cost.”\\\n- “Memory is unreliable.”\\\n- “Systems outlive people.”\\\n- “Identity is performative.”\\\n- “Violence solves problems but creates rot.”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## How Invariants Prevent Scale Drift\\\nScale drift happens when:\\\n- Micro-writing (lines/scenes) starts optimizing for local coolness\\\n- Macro-worldbuilding optimizes for encyclopedic accumulation\\\n- The two stop agreeing on what the story *means*\\\n\\\n**Invariants are your compatibility layer.**\\\nThey let you make *any* addition—character, faction, tech, event—and immediately test:\\\n- Does this deepen the invariant?\\\n- Does it challenge it in a way that still confirms it?\\\n- Or does it contradict the invariant (therefore breaking the IP’s meaning)?\\\n\\\nIf it contradicts, you cut it—no debate, no cope.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## A Simple Governance Loop (So Your “Mania Muse” Doesn’t Drive Off a Cliff)\\\nYou don’t suppress the Dionysian drive. You **timebox it** and **hand it off** to a governor.\\\n\\\n### Loop\\\n1. **Diverge (Dionysian / Mania Muse)**  \\\n   Generate options fast. No judgment.\\\n2. **Converge (Apollonian / Editor)**  \\\n   Apply invariants as a kill-filter.\\\n3. **Integrate (Systems Thinking / Architect)**  \\\n   Ask: what does this change cause elsewhere? (second-order effects)\\\n4. **Commit (Operator / Producer)**  \\\n   Lock the decision into canon and move forward.\\\n\\\n### The Governor Rule\\\nThe governor is not “a vibe.” It’s your invariants.  \\\n**Invariants set pace. Muse supplies material.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Scaling From Sentence → Scene → Season → World\\\nUse the same invariant test at every level.\\\n\\\n### 1) Sentence / Dialogue\\\nA line is “on-IP” if it either:\\\n- states an invariant,\\\n- implies it,\\\n- or contradicts it in a way the story will punish/correct.\\\n\\\n**Test:** “Could this line exist in a different IP with different invariants?”  \\\nIf yes, rewrite it until it could not.\\\n\\\n### 2) Scene\\\nA scene earns its existence if it:\\\n- forces a choice where **invariants impose cost**\\\n- or reveals an invariant through consequences\\\n\\\n**Test:** “If I removed this scene, would an invariant be less true?”\\\n\\\n### 3) Arc / Season\\\nAn arc works if it:\\\n- escalates pressure on invariants\\\n- increases systemic consequences (feedback loops, blowback, compounding costs)\\\n\\\n**Test:** “Does the arc *tighten* the invariant, or does it dilute it with side-quests?”\\\n\\\n### 4) World / Lore\\\nWorldbuilding is valid if it:\\\n- is a machine that **makes invariants inevitable**\\\n- produces recurring outcomes that confirm meaning\\\n\\\n**Test:** “Does the world *enforce* the invariant even when characters resist?”\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Synergy: MCDP Doctrine + Systems Thinking\\\nMarine doctrine is useful here because it’s built for **uncertainty, friction, and changing conditions**—which is exactly your wicked creative field.\\\n\\\n### 1) Doctrine as “Invariants” (Commander's Intent)\\\nMCDP-style thinking emphasizes guiding action with **purpose and intent** rather than brittle scripts. That maps cleanly to your invariants: they are your IP’s “commander’s intent” for meaning.  \\\n- MCDP 1 **Warfighting** frames a philosophy of war and decision-making under uncertainty. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\\\n\\\n### 2) Planning as a Conceptual Framework (Not a Perfect Script)\\\nMCDP 5 **Planning** explicitly treats planning as preparation for an uncertain future, not prediction. That matches how you should treat narrative planning: you plan to **adapt**, not to “lock the universe.” :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}\\\n\\\n### 3) Campaigning = Linking Tactics to Strategy (Micro to Macro)\\\nMCDP 1-2 **Campaigning** is basically “how to connect many smaller actions to higher goals.” That is exactly your problem: sentence/scene (tactics) must serve arc/world meaning (strategy). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}\\\n\\\n### 4) Tactics = Local Action, Real Consequences\\\nMCDP 1-3 **Tactics** is about winning battles—local decisions with compounding consequences. That maps to scene-writing: a scene should create **irreversible pressure** that rolls forward. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}\\\n\\\n### Practical Synthesis\\\n- **Invariants** = intent / doctrine (what must remain true)\\\n- **Scenes** = tactical actions (local decisions)\\\n- **Arcs/Seasons** = campaigns (sequencing actions toward meaning)\\\n- **Lore/World systems** = the operating environment (constraints + feedback)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Required Reading (Actual Books)\\\n\\\n### A) Systems Thinking (Read these first)\\\n1. **Thinking in Systems: A Primer** — Donella H.
