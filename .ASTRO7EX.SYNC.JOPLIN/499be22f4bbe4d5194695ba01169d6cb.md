# Exercise T — Beat-Sheet Nonlinear Structure Rewrite

Experiment with nonlinear storytelling by applying one or more of these methods to your beat sheet:

---

### **1. Reverse Sequences**
- **Prompt:** Move backward from Sequence 8 to Sequence 1.  
- **Rewrite:** [Describe what changes when the story is told in reverse order.]  

---

### **2. Flash from Sequence 8**
- **Prompt:** Insert part of Sequence 8 into Sequence 1 as a “flash.”  
- **Rewrite:** [Define how this sets up the goal of Sequence 1 and reframes the later reveal.]  

---

### **3. Jump Time**
- **Prompt:** Mix and match sequences to create nonlinear jumps in time/place.  
- **Rewrite:** [Describe the new timeline and how it still tracks logically.]  

---

### **4. Change POV per Sequence**
- **Prompt:** Switch main character perspective per sequence (for ensemble stories).  
- **Rewrite:** [List whose POV drives each sequence.]  

---

### **5. Convergence Points**
- **Prompt:** Create places where characters converge at act breaks or sequence breaks.  
- **Rewrite:** [Describe the physical or thematic connection where they intersect.]
