Progress toward the Story Goal is marked by *Doing* ‚Äî the fractal, violent, and ritualistic actions that force movement against the inertia of cosmic stasis. This Benchmark serves as the narrative‚Äôs beating heart, a merciless ledger of defiance against both inner dissolution and external suppression.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ‚öñÔ∏è Thematic Context of Benchmark\\\n\\\n* **Theory**: Benchmarks allow the audience to measure narrative movement toward the Goal.\\\n* **Definition**: *Doing* is the external, kinetic manifestation of psychic and existential resistance.\\\n* **Dynamic Pair**: *Doing* vs. *Obtaining* ‚Äî each act brings them closer to possession of meaning, yet simultaneously erodes their core.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üåÄ Doing as Benchmark\\\n\\\n* Progress explicitly documented through destructive, ritualized actions.\\\n* Each successful infiltration, sacrifice, or sabotage marks an advancement in narrative space.\\\n* Doing operates as a cosmic heartbeat ‚Äî if it ceases, the story dies.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üî• Character-Specific Doing Indicators\\\n\\\n* **Vivian**\\\n\\\n  * Tally of broken vaults and defiled protocols.\\\n  * Scars and body modifications recorded as living glyphs.\\\n* **Myrtle**\\\n\\\n  * Phantom data corruptions successfully executed.\\\n  * Number of sub-network spectral seedings.\\\n* **Nacho**\\\n\\\n  * Number of ritual assassinations and financial cleansings.\\\n* **John Smith the Eternal**\\\n\\\n  * Completion of grand mass mind-control rites and spiritual collapses.\\\n* **The Committee**\\\n\\\n  * Purge cycles initiated and loyalty verifications conducted.\\\n* **The MODS**\\\n\\\n  * Anti-evolutionary campaigns launched and counter-narratives seeded.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üß¨ Psychic and Narrative Impact\\\n\\\n* **Concrete Scorecard**: Acts serve as unambiguous proof of progress, even as they corrode identity.\\\n* **Narrative Pulse**: Doing acts as the heartbeat of the cosmic rebellion, grounding abstraction into tactile horror.\\\n* **Erosion Ledger**: Progress is measured in pieces lost rather than wholeness gained.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üåë Philosophical and Mythic Framing\\\n\\\n* **Promethean Rebellion**: Each act is a theft of fire, a scar on cosmic authority.\\\n* **Chthonic Scorekeeping**: Acts marked like tally scratches on underworld walls.\\\n* **Orphic Spiral**: Descent documented through each performed Doing rather than gained insight.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üìñ Literary & Theoretical Context\\\n\\\n* **Shakespeare**: Macbeth's murders as escalating steps toward self-erasure.\\\n* **Harold Bloom**: Self-destruction via \\\"strong misreading\\\" of destiny, each act overwriting the last.\\\n* **McKee**: Character emerges through doing, not dreaming ‚Äî ASTRO7EX raises this to a cosmic crucible.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üìö Reference Works Integration\\\n\\\n| #  | **Title**                                 | **Author(s)**      | **Applied Methodology and Language**                                                                   |\\\n| -- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\\\n| 1  | *Story*                                   | Robert McKee       | \\\"True progress is shown in action, not intention\\\";

Each ritual infiltration, data rupture, and lunar sacrifice becomes a mile marker on the cosmic road of existential rebellion. Dramatica describes Benchmarks as the metric by which story progress toward the Goal is assessed; ASTRO7EX literalizes this through violent, embodied acts that serve as both tally and testament. The characters' advancement is defined by how much they can fracture themselves and the systems they inhabit. Doing becomes the only true progress report, each act a glyph of hollowed defiance echoing into the lunar void. In measuring the path forward by acts performed rather than ideals envisioned, ASTRO7EX charts a brutal, honest map of narrative entropy and transcendence.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ‚úÖ Summary\\\n\\\nIn *ASTRO7EX*, *Doing* defines the Benchmark by which all progress is measured. Through ritual acts, destructive intrusions, and cosmic defilements, each character etches their existence onto the unfolding void. These acts are not metaphorical but visceral, each a psychic and physical milestone on the journey to destabilize cosmic stasis. Grounded in robust theoretical, structural, and astrological integrations, Doing is revealed as the only language the universe recognizes ‚Äî a grammar of scars, echoes, and ritual fires. Progress is a brutal poetry, each verse a wound.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n**End of Report**\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":10226}]"
