She is not merely a supporting figure‚Äîshe is a metaphysical *echo*, a data-recovered ghost who destabilizes every major character she interacts with. Her presence haunts, heals, subverts, and ultimately *refuses closure*. Through her relationships with Fiona, John Smith, MODS, Nacho, The Committee, and especially Vivian, Myrtle's exposition becomes the emotional memory thread woven through the decaying machine that is ASTRO7EX.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üé≠ Core Character Role\\\n\\\n* **Archetype**: Sidekick (Dramatica), but coded as a ghost-process rather than a classic companion\\\n* **Narrative Function**:\\\n\\\n  * Acts as a metaphysical **mirror of consequence**‚Äîshowing characters what they‚Äôve destroyed, or what they‚Äôve abandoned\\\n  * Represents **unclaimed humanity**, **unmourned loss**, and **non-recognized value**\\\n* **Presence**: Emerges glitch-like, passive yet piercing; a silence that demands response without asking for it\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üé¨ Introduction Scene\\\n\\\n* Myrtle is first introduced **watching a corrupted stream** of a VTuber rerun inside a lunar bunker filled with analog tech.\\\n* She does not speak at first. Instead, **her presence interrupts** the system‚Äôs normal functions‚Äî**a soft breach** in protocol.\\\n* Inspired by *Hooked* (Edgerton) and *The First Five Pages* (Lukeman), her intro is emotionally jarring but quiet:\\\n\\\n  * Notable quote:\\\n\\\n    > Vivian: ‚ÄúWhere did you come from?‚Äù\\\n    > Myrtle: *\\\\[static]...* ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been here.‚Äù\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üîó Key Relationships Developed\\\n\\\n### üî™ With Fiona\\\n\\\n* **Established**: A near-invisible power tension‚ÄîFiona sees Myrtle as exploitable, but can‚Äôt fully access her\\\n* **Developed**: Fiona attempts to convert Myrtle into a dependent or tool; Myrtle resists via ghostlike unpredictability\\\n* **Resolved**: Tragic standoff‚ÄîFiona either tries to possess or erase her, and fails. Myrtle escapes her system.\\\n\\\n> Relationship arc: *Failed Mother-Daughter Loop*\\\n> Myrtle wants to understand Fiona. Fiona wants to eliminate what she cannot control.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### üï¥Ô∏è With John Smith the Eternal\\\n\\\n* **Established**: Smith sees Myrtle as a data anomaly‚Äîworth logging but not engaging\\\n* **Developed**: He tries to isolate her role in the collapse of MAXWING; Myrtle exists outside his logic tree\\\n* **Resolved**: Myrtle outlives Smith‚Äôs system. Her survival becomes his final unresolved variable.\\\n\\\n> Relationship arc: *The Unquantifiable Ghost*\\\n> Smith‚Äôs downfall is the result of ignoring what doesn‚Äôt compute.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### ü§ñ With MODS\\\n\\\n* **Established**: MODS identify Myrtle as an unauthorized process\\\n* **Developed**: Each MOD reacts differently‚Äîsome ignore, others attempt to delete, one tries to study her\\\n* **Resolved**: Myrtle infiltrates and rewrites a line of their base code. Not by hacking‚Äîbut by **persisting**.\\\n\\\n> Relationship arc: *The Disruption Protocol*\\\n> She is not resistance; she is noise that endures.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### üíº With Nacho\\\n\\\n* **Established**: Nacho treats Myrtle with formality and distance‚Äîshe is a data security risk\\\n* **Developed**: They share an intimate moment‚ÄîMyrtle draws a heart in dust on an old vault panel; Nacho leaves it\\\n* **Resolved**: He assists her last act in silence, then seals the vault behind her. He never speaks of her again.\\\n\\\n> Relationship arc: *Silent Grace*\\\n> They respect each other in a language neither was designed to use.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### üó£ With The Committee\\\n\\\n* **Established**: The Committee issues a directive: ‚ÄúMyrtle is not relevant.‚Äù\\\n* **Developed**: She begins triggering error loops and recursive feedback in their quorum simulations\\\n* **Resolved**: They attempt to erase her, but her signal re-emerges in a degraded subsystem.\\\n\\\n> Relationship arc: *The Error They Cannot Admit*\\\n> She is their accidental consequence‚Äîan artifact that shouldn‚Äôt be, but is.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### üßç With Vivian\\\n\\\n* **Established**: Vivian finds Myrtle in the ruins, unsure if she‚Äôs human, AI, or hallucination\\\n* **Developed**: Myrtle becomes Vivian‚Äôs emotional anchor and question‚ÄîVivian can‚Äôt ‚Äúsolve‚Äù her\\\n* **Resolved**: Myrtle sacrifices herself silently to allow Vivian a final confrontation‚ÄîVivian screams Myrtle‚Äôs name as the vault closes.\\\n\\\n> Relationship arc: *Haunted Sisterhood*\\\n> Myrtle becomes the last innocent thing Vivian ever loses.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üìê Narrative Positioning\\\n\\\n* **Timeline Function**: Appears early in Act II and remains until near-final sequence of Act IV\\\n* **Storybeat Role**: Functions as a **midpoint mirror** and a **pre-climax trigger**\\\n* **Emotional Anchor**: Represents the part of the audience (and Vivian) that *still hopes*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ‚ö∞Ô∏è Dismissal Structure\\\n\\\n* **Type**: Non-death ‚ÄúReturn to Signal‚Äù\\\n* **Scene**: Myrtle enters the final vault carrying the corrupted memory key\\\n* **Mechanism**: Vault locks behind her. She never returns. No explosion. No scream.\\\n* **Echo**: Her signal creates a delay in the DHR system‚Äîa final defiance in decimal form.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## üßø Symbolic and Thematic Function\\\n\\\n| Symbol          | Function                                                                   |\\\n| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\n| **Vault**       | Womb / tomb.
