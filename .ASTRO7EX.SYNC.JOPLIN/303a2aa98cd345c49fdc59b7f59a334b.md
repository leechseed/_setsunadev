## Narrative Invariants (Two-Tier Model)
---

This series operates under two classes of narrative invariants:

1. **Mechanical Narrative Invariants** — non-negotiable structural laws enforced by plot outcomes.
2. **Experiential Narrative Invariants** — persistent human truths that emerge from repeated contact with those laws.

Mechanical invariants govern what can happen.
Experiential invariants govern what it means.
