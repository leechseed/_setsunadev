## Overview

Non-Negotiable Invariants are the primary mechanism for maintaining coherence across scale in wicked, chaotic creative domains.  
They function as **constraints on meaning**, not as lore facts, themes, or plot rules.

Their role is to prevent **scale drift**—the breakdown that occurs when micro-level content (dialogue, scenes) and macro-level content (world history, lore) operate under different assumptions.

---

## Definition: Non-Negotiable Invariants
---


**Non-Negotiable Invariants** are a small, fixed set of statements (3–5 maximum) that must remain true across all levels of resolution within a project.

They are:
- Not negotiable
- Not contextual
- Not aesthetic
- Not optional

They define what *cannot be contradicted*, regardless of how the work evolves.

---

## Invariant Constraints

Each invariant must satisfy all of the following:

- Be true in a **single line of dialogue**
- Be true across a **character arc**
- Be true in **world history**
- Be true regardless of tone, genre shift, or medium

If an element violates an invariant, it is removed immediately—regardless of originality or appeal.

---

## Examples of Valid Invariants

*(Examples only; not prescriptive)*

- **Power always has a cost**
- **Memory is unreliable**
- **Systems outlive people**
- **Identity is performative**
- **Violence solves problems but creates rot**

Each example constrains meaning rather than describing events or lore.

---

## Scale Enforcement Rules

Invariants operate identically at every scale.

| Scale Level | Enforcement Question |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Word | Does this phrasing imply a belief that violates an invariant? |
| Dialogue | Does this line contradict a non-negotiable truth? |
| Scene | Does the outcome reinforce or undermine an invariant? |
| Character Arc | Is the character shaped by or exempt from the invariant? |
| World History | Does the long-term result align with invariant consequences? |

No scale is exempt from enforcement.

---

## Failure Conditions

A project is considered unstable if:

- New invariants are introduced mid-development
- Invariants are applied selectively
- Lore exceptions override invariant constraints
- “Rule of cool” supersedes invariant integrity

Any of the above indicates uncontrolled scale drift.

---

## Operational Use

Non-Negotiable Invariants are used to:

- Filter ideas during ideation
- Kill content during revision
- Resolve conflicts between micro and macro design
- Maintain coherence during expansion
- Enable confident pruning without loss of direction

They are evaluated continuously, not episodically.

---

## Summary

Non-Negotiable Invariants are the **governing layer** of meaning in chaotic creative systems.  
They do not create content.  
They decide what is allowed to survive.

**If it violates an invariant, it does not belong.**
