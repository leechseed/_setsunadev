Fiona represents seductive diversion—a path of controlled pleasure and detour. Myrtle, though distant and ghostly, radiates **genuine devotion** to Vivian’s emotional trajectory. Their interactions are not loud but loaded. Across whispered datafeeds, side glances, and brief but loaded standoffs, the two navigate a **chilly psychic rivalry** for influence—each representing opposing models of feminine alignment.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🎯 Structural Objective\\\n\\\n* **Function**: Reveal Myrtle’s inner loyalty and spiritual resonance by contrasting her with Fiona’s erotic logic and emotional misdirection.\\\n* **Narrative Purpose**: Their relationship serves as a **test of allegiance**—a trial of what kind of support Vivian will accept.\\\n* **Philosophical Arc**: *“Devotion without desire vs. desire without devotion.”*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧱 Dramatica Role Alignment\\\n\\\n| Character | Archetypal Role | Narrative Function                           |\\\n| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\\\n| Fiona     | Contagonist     | Detour, Seduction, Spiritual Disruption      |\\\n| Myrtle    | Sidekick        | Loyalty, Emotional Anchor, Witness to Change |\\\n\\\nTheir opposition lies in **who gets to stand beside Vivian—and why**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🌱 Establishing the Relationship\\\n\\\n### Scene Reference: *Dustfield Broadcasts, Segment 11*\\\n\\\n* Fiona first becomes aware of Myrtle while reviewing low-level interference patterns during Vivian’s blackout periods.\\\n* Myrtle does not speak.
