It argues that logistics is integral to operations, inseparable from maneuver and command, and essential to sustaining tempo and freedom of action in war. The publication defines logistics in operational terms, explains its relationship to uncertainty, friction, and decisionmaking, and emphasizes the need for responsiveness, adaptability, and integration with tactical and operational plans. It demands that commanders treat logistics as a command responsibility and plan for sustainment as deliberately as for combat.\\\n\\\n## TL;DR\\\n- Logistics directly enables combat power and operational tempo.\\\n- Logistics is an integral part of operations, not a separate function.\\\n- Uncertainty and friction dominate logistical environments.\\\n- Responsiveness and adaptability are more important than efficiency alone.\\\n- Logistics must support maneuver and initiative.\\\n- Commanders are responsible for logistical effectiveness.\\\n- Sustainment shapes what operations are possible.\\\n- Logistics planning must anticipate change and disruption.\\\n- Successful operations depend on the continuous flow of support.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Table of Contents\\\n1.
