## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines and distinguishes **three separate narrative systems** used to design, evaluate, and sustain long-form storytelling:

- **Mechanical Narrative Invariants**  
- **Experiential Narrative Invariants**  
- **Narrative Doctrine**

These systems are **complementary but non-overlapping**.  
Each answers a different question, operates at a different level, and serves a distinct function.

Confusing or collapsing these systems leads to tonal drift, thematic contradiction, or ideological capture.

---

## 2. System I — Mechanical Narrative Invariants

### Definition  
**Mechanical Narrative Invariants** describe what is *structurally true* in the story world regardless of character belief, morality, or intention.

They govern:
- Causality  
- Power behavior  
- Accumulation over time  
- Cost and irreversibility  
- Systemic persistence and failure  

They are enforced through **outcomes**, not dialogue or interpretation.

### Key Properties
- Non-negotiable  
- Impersonal  
- Unaware of meaning or justice  
- Resistant to exception  
- Observable through repetition  

### Function
Mechanical invariants define **what must happen** when certain conditions are met.

They operate like physical laws:
- Characters may misunderstand them
- Characters may resist them
- Characters may deny them  

—but outcomes remain consistent.

### What They Are Not
- They are not morals  
- They are not themes  
- They are not lessons  
- They are not ideological positions  

They do not care what *should* happen.

## 3. System II — Experiential Narrative Invariants

### Definition  
**Experiential Narrative Invariants** describe what people *learn to believe* after living under mechanical invariants long enough.

They are not enforced by the system itself, but by **memory, repetition, and survival**.

### Key Properties
- Subjective but consistent  
- Learned, not declared  
- Emotionally internalized  
- Often informal or unspoken  
- Shared across characters and audience  

### Function
Experiential invariants define **what it feels like** to exist in the world governed by the mechanics.

They explain:
- Why characters act cautiously or desperately  
- Why hope persists without payoff  
- Why meaning survives without leverage  

They are the **psychological residue** of structure.

### What They Are Not
- They do not change outcomes  
- They do not grant power  
- They do not override mechanics  

Experiential invariants **interpret** reality; they do not control it.

## 4. System III — Narrative Doctrine

### Definition  
**Narrative Doctrine** is the internal decision framework used by the creator to choose *which stories are permitted* under the established reality.

It is not a property of the story world.  
It is a constraint on authorship.

### Key Properties
- Meta-level  
- Invisible to characters  
- Not enforced by plot  
- Not spoken in dialogue  
- Operates through refusal  

### Function
Narrative doctrine defines:
- Which resolutions are disallowed  
- Which arcs are avoided  
- Which assumptions are rejected  
- Which narrative conveniences are refused  

Doctrine prevents **creative drift** when multiple valid narrative options exist.

### What It Is Not
- It is not an invariant  
- It is not a theme  
- It is not ideology  
- It is not messaging  

Doctrine governs **choice**, not truth.

## 5. Relationship Between the Three Systems

These systems form a strict hierarchy:

1. **Mechanical Invariants** — determine outcomes  
2. **Experiential Invariants** — determine perception  
3. **Narrative Doctrine** — determines authorial decisions  

Rules of interaction:
- Doctrine may never contradict mechanical invariants  
- Experiential invariants may never override mechanics  
- Doctrine filters choices before scenes are written  

Each system constrains the one below it without collapsing into it.

---

## 6. Common Failure Modes

### Collapse of Systems
- Treating experiential truth as mechanical fact  
- Treating doctrine as in-world belief  
- Treating ideology as invariant  

### Symptoms
- Systems that “learn” or “feel”  
- Trauma that grants leverage  
- Exposure that halts enforcement  
- Meaning that produces power  

These failures reduce narrative integrity.

---

## 7. Usage Notes

- Mechanical invariants are validated through repetition  
- Experiential invariants are validated through consistency of feeling  
- Narrative doctrine is validated through refusal, not assertion  

A story may succeed emotionally while failing structurally if these systems are confused.

This document exists to prevent that confusion.
