Overview\\\n\\\nThis report documents the finalized **Main Character Choices** for Vivian in the Dramatica systemâ€™s **Storyforming phase**. These decisions define the foundation of her emotional and thematic role in ASTRO7EX and determine how her internal arc will resonate with the audience, opposition, and narrative design.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 2. Main Character Resolve\\\n\\\n- **âœ… Choice:** **Steadfast**\\\n\\\n> Vivian does **not** change her worldview.  \\\n> She endures, resists, and holds to her personal truth in the face of overwhelming opposition.\\\n\\\n**Astrological Justification:**\\\n- â˜¿ Mercury in Scorpio + â™„ Saturn in Capricorn â†’ Deep internal certainty and resistance to external change.\\\n- ðŸŒ™ Pisces Moon â†’ Vulnerable emotional core protected by endurance mechanisms.\\\n\\\n**Narrative Insight:**  \\\nVivian is the fixed point around which the story spins. The world pushes her to break; she does not.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 3. Main Character Growth Direction\\\n\\\n- **âœ… Choice:** Holding out for something to **Stop**\\\n\\\n> Vivian waits for something externalâ€”systemic, oppressive, falseâ€”to **end**.  \\\n> Her journey is defined by resistance, not pursuit.\\\n\\\n**Astrological Justification:**\\\n- â™‡ Pluto themes dominate her emotional logic: she waits for the machine to die before she can live.\\\n- Internal patterning implies suppression, not desire.\\\n\\\n**Narrative Insight:**  \\\nVivian is not waiting for hope. She is enduring the end of a cycleâ€”of memory, prophecy, controlâ€”and she refuses to move until it breaks.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 4. Main Character Approach\\\n\\\n- **âœ… Choice:** **Do-er**\\\n\\\n> Vivian responds to personal problems by **acting externally**â€”sabotage, theft, resistance, disruption.\\\n\\\n**Astrological Justification:**\\\n- â™‚ Aries Mars â†’ Externalized survival instinct.\\\n- â†‘ Gemini Rising â†’ Kinetic, fast-twitch, reactive behavior patterns.\\\n- â˜¿ Scorpio Mercury â†’ Her thoughts donâ€™t stay thoughtsâ€”they become actions.\\\n\\\n**Narrative Insight:**  \\\nEven her numbness is kinetic. Sheâ€™s always *doing something*, even if itâ€™s destruction.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 5. Main Character Problem-Solving Style\\\n\\\n- **âœ… Choice:** **Intuitive**\\\n\\\n> Vivian processes the world through **relational, symbolic, and emotional pattern recognition** rather than step-by-step logic.\\\n\\\n**Astrological Justification:**\\\n- ðŸŒ™ Pisces Moon + â˜¿ Scorpio Mercury â†’ Subconscious pattern-reading, emotionally driven cognition.\\\n- â˜‰ Libra Sun â†’ Weighs harmony, not data.\\\n- â™„ Saturn in Capricorn â†’ Internal coherence, not external proof.\\\n\\\n**Narrative Insight:**  \\\nShe doesn't analyzeâ€”she *senses*. Her moves are poetic, emotional, and deeply nonlinear.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 6.
