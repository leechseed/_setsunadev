You are not your name. You are the war inside your own head—and it’s winning.”**\\\n\\\n*Fight Club* is a manifesto disguised as a mental breakdown. It weaponizes identity crisis, anti-capitalist rage, and repressed masculinity into a destructive loop of self-destruction and rebirth. The true enemy is not society—but the part of you that accepted it.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3707}]"
