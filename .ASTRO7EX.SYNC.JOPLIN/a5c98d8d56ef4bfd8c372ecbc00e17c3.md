Statement of Position\\\n\\\nThis manifesto exists to bind creative decision-making.\\\n\\\nIt is not an argument.  \\\nIt is not a critique written for approval.  \\\nIt is not an attempt to reform institutions or audiences.\\\n\\\nIt is a declaration of refusal.\\\n\\\nThis work rejects narratives that exist to soothe, correct, or morally equilibrate reality.  \\\nIt adopts a stance of **continuity over equilibrium**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 2. Diagnosis: The Rot in Contemporary Mass Narrative\\\n\\\nContemporary Western mass media increasingly treats storytelling as an instrument of correction.\\\n\\\nStories are expected to:\\\n- Heal audiences\\\n- Teach systems to behave\\\n- Balance moral accounts\\\n- Reward authenticity\\\n- Convert exposure into reform\\\n\\\nThis framework produces narratives that are:\\\n- Therapeutic rather than truthful  \\\n- Moralizing rather than observant  \\\n- Equilibrating rather than descriptive  \\\n\\\nSystems are portrayed as broken because they are unfair,  \\\nrather than unfair because they persist.\\\n\\\nThis is not realism.  \\\nIt is consolation disguised as critique.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 3. Foundational Assertion\\\n\\\n**Systems do not seek balance.  \\\nThey seek continuity.**\\\n\\\nWhen pressured, systems:\\\n- Preserve operation\\\n- Localize damage\\\n- Accept unequal outcomes\\\n- Sacrifice participants\\\n- Adapt interfaces, not cores\\\n\\\nNarratives that insist otherwise do not challenge power.  \\\nThey sentimentalize it.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 4. Prohibitions\\\n\\\nWe do not tell stories where:\\\n\\\n1. Exposure halts enforcement or produces reform by default.  \\\n2. Suffering earns systemic recognition or moral credit.  \\\n3. Institutions learn, repent, or self-correct through awareness.  \\\n4. Trauma unlocks exceptional leverage or immunity.  \\\n5. Justice arrives through balance, symmetry, or restoration.  \\\n6. Meaning alters outcomes simply by being sincere.  \\\n7. The system is portrayed as confused rather than operational.\\\n\\\nThese narratives are prohibited not because they are immoral,  \\\nbut because they are dishonest.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 5. Permissions\\\n\\\nWe allow stories where:\\\n\\\n1. Systems continue functioning despite visible harm.  \\\n2. Unequal outcomes preserve institutional continuity.  \\\n3. Individuals adapt without being healed.  \\\n4. Meaning survives internally without producing leverage.  \\\n5. Quiet moments clarify identity without softening consequence.  \\\n\\\nThese stories do not resolve injustice.  \\\nThey reveal its structure.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 6. North-Star Sentence\\\n\\\n**This work tells stories about people surviving systems that do not want to be fixed.**\\\n\\\nAll creative decisions are evaluated against this line.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 7. Status\\\n\\\n**Manifesto Locked.**\\\n\\\nThis document binds future choices.  \\\nDeviation requires conscious rejection, not convenience.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3105}]"
