it does not change logic.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## The Narrative Scale Ladder\\\n\\\nCanonical progression:\\\n\\\n> **Sentence → Beat → Scene → Episode → Arc → Season → World**\\\n\\\nEach rung:\\\n- Contains all lower rungs  \\\n- Introduces broader consequence  \\\n- Activates more persistent effects  \\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Responsibilities at Each Scale\\\n\\\n### 1\"],[0,\". **Se\"],[-1,\"qu\"],[1,\"nt\"],[0,\"ence\"],[-1,\"s compound cost and exposure.**\\\n\\\n4. **Arcs prove the system survives people.**\\\n\\\n5. **Seasons show institutional counter-moves.**\\\n\\\n6. **The world enforces invariants without heroes.**\"],[1,\"**\\\n**Unit of pressure**\\\n\\\nResponsible for:\\\n- Intent\\\n- Implication\\\n- Micro power shifts\\\n- Tone consistency\\\n\\\nMust ensure:\\\n- Every line *does something*\\\n\\\nMust not:\\\n- Explain the world\\\n- State theme\\\n- Resolve conflict\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 2. **Beat**\\\n**Unit of change**\\\n\\\nResponsible for:\\\n- Micro cause → effect\\\n- Decision or realization\\\n- Momentum\\\n\\\nMust ensure:\\\n- A before/after difference\\\n\\\nMust not:\\\n- Reset emotional state\\\n- Stall motion\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 3. **Scene**\\\n**Unit of conflict**\\\n\\\nResponsible for:\\\n- Opposing goals\\\n- Escalation\\\n- Cost\\\n\\\nMust ensure:\\\n- Someone loses something\\\n- Resistance is present\\\n\\\nMust not:\\\n- Introduce new world rules\\\n- End cleanly for all parties\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 4. **Episode**\\\n**Unit of inquiry**\\\n\\\nResponsible for:\\\n- Testing a belief or assumption\\\n- Revealing behavioral patterns\\\n- Consequence propagation\\\n\\\nMust ensure:\\\n- A question is pressured, not solved\\\n\\\nMust not:\\\n- Restore the status quo\\\n- Deliver final answers\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 5. **Arc**\\\n**Unit of transformation**\\\n\\\nResponsible for:\\\n- Irreversible change\\\n- Closed-off options\\\n- Compounded consequence\\\n\\\nMust ensure:\\\n- Characters or systems are no longer the same\\\n\\\nMust not:\\\n- Allow cost-free growth\\\n- Undo prior damage\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 6. **Season**\\\n**Unit of argument**\\\n\\\nResponsible for:\\\n- Making a claim about how the world works\\\n- Stress-testing that claim\\\n- Clarifying cost or failure\\\n\\\nMust ensure:\\\n- A coherent thematic stance emerges\\\n\\\nMust not:\\\n- Introduce new moral physics\\\n- Contradict prior invariants\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n### 7. **World**\\\n**Unit of permanence**\\\n\\\nResponsible for:\\\n- History\\\n- Systems\\\n- Rule enforcement beyond characters\\\n\\\nMust ensure:\\\n- The world functions without protagonists\\\n\\\nMust not:\\\n- Bend rules for favorites\\\n- Retcon consequences\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## What Scaling Does *Not* Do\\\n\\\nScaling must never:\\\n- Introduce exceptions  \\\n- Rewrite causality  \\\n- Change moral logic  \\\n- Override systemic power  \\\n\\\nIf scaling requires new rules, the foundation is broken.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Common Scaling Failures\\\n\\\n- **Lore dump at scene scale** → world logic introduced too early  \\\n- **Theme stated in dialogue** → season logic forced into sentence  \\\n- **Reset episodes** → arc consequences avoided  \\\n- **Hero fixes the system** → world scale violated  \\\n\\\nMost “writing problems” are actually **scale violations**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Scaling Diagnostic Questions\\\n\\\nUse these to debug fast:\\\n\\\n- What changed at this scale that could not change at a lower one?\\\n- Did consequence radius increase?\\\n- Did any rule appear that was not already enforced below?\\\n- Is this moment too small or too large for its scale?\\\n\\\nIf it feels “off,” it’s almost always a scale mismatch.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Relationship to Invariants (Preview)\\\n\\\nScaling does **not** create invariants.  \\\nIt **activates** them across wider territory.\\\n\\\n- Invariants define *what is always true*  \\\n- Scaling defines *how far the truth reaches*  \\\n\\\nThe next knowledgebase entry will formalize how **scaling interacts with narrative layers and invariants**.\\\n\\\n---\"],[0,\"\\\n\"]],\"start1\":1,\"start2\":1,\"length1\":300,\"length2\":4554}]"
