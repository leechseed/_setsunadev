body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\" Illustrating the Overall Story Throughline — *Prophets of Rot*\\\n\\\n**Throughline:** Overall Story\\\n**Title:** *Prophets of Rot*\\\n**Dramatica Domain:** **Activity**\\\n**Prepared by:** GUTS99 // Narrative Chemistry Engine\\\n**Stage:** Step 3 — Illustrating\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📚 Dramatica Theory: The Activity Domain\\\n\\\nIn Dramatica, the **Activity Domain** refers to a story world where conflict arises from what people are **doing**—not just what they are feeling or believing. In ASTRO7EX, the world is defined by procedural decay, corporate machinations, and system-level operations that perpetuate rot. Characters are engaged in:\\\n\\\n* Hiding, hacking, extracting, chasing, resisting\\\n* Administering punishment, managing loss, enforcing compliance\\\n* Ritualized failure: rebirth cycles that lead nowhere\\\n\\\nThe *Prophets of Rot* title positions the overall story as a conflict born of movement, rot, and corrupted purpose. **The problem isn’t philosophical—it’s what people are actively doing to keep a dead world running.**\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🪐 Narrative Astrology: Planetary Transits & Symbolic Motion\\\n\\\nThe Activity domain correlates with the astrological concept of **malefic transits** (e.g., Pluto-Saturn, Mars-Saturn) that represent destructive momentum. In ASTRO7EX:\\\n\\\n* **Pluto in Capricorn** – bureaucratic decay masked as order\\\n* **Saturn retrograde** – internalized restriction and soul-rotting responsibility\\\n* **Mars square Neptune** – actions distorted by illusion, martyrdom through misdirected effort\\\n\\\nThis is a story about **motion gone wrong**: characters are *doing things* that accelerate collapse, not redemption.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧠 Robert McKee: Action as Expression of Character\\\n\\\nMcKee insists that character is revealed through **choice under pressure**. In *Prophets of Rot*, every character’s action deepens the rot or exposes their refusal to accept change:\\\n\\\n* Vivian **acts** against inertia—she doesn’t believe in waiting\\\n* MODS **act** by denying action—stalling, preventing, delaying\\\n* Fiona sells comfort as performance—her action is seductive stillness\\\n* Nacho keeps **archiving**, protecting, preserving: motion within containment\\\n\\\nConflict manifests in attempts to push, escape, delete, or override systemic corruption.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📖 Harold Bloom: American Themes in Action\\\n\\\nBloom’s mythic American archetype is the **exiled self**—the individual whose authenticity is punished by consensus. In *Prophets of Rot*, this punishment is carried out by action:\\\n\\\n* Vivian is constantly **flagged**, **banned**, **silenced**\\\n* The MODS act like a courtroom that never closes\\\n* The machine gods are still processing sins from a dead religion\\\n\\\nThis story shows how **action is punished** when it doesn’t conform to **rotted-out rules**. Even **movement is betrayal** in a decayed system.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧬 Jeff Lyons: Moral Premise Meets Movement\\\n\\\nLyons emphasizes **moral architecture through behavior**. The moral axis of *Prophets of Rot* is:\\\n\\\n> When we act based on corrupted memory, we risk becoming monsters; when we accept our brokenness and choose meaning, we become whole.\\\n\\\nCharacters act on ghost-data, bad memory, trauma remnants. Their **behavior is reactive**, **looped**, and **narratively viral**. The plot unfolds as failed attempts to act morally in a morally unavailable system.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🎭 Shakespearean Parallels: Action as Tragedy and Decay\\\n\\\nShakespeare’s tragedies often hinge on flawed action—where the **activity of the protagonist accelerates their doom** rather than averting it. In *Hamlet*, delayed action becomes corruption. In *Macbeth*, over-action becomes madness. In *King Lear*, misjudged action shatters the kingdom.\\\n\\\nIn *Prophets of Rot*, we see a Shakespearean structure:\\\n\\\n* **The system is already broken** (Lear’s kingdom / ASTRO7EX bureaucracy)\\\n* **Action hastens downfall** (Macbeth’s ambition / MODS' enforcement)\\\n* **Ghosts of memory drive behavior** (Banquo / Penelope / neural echoes)\\\n* **Corruption is enacted, not just endured**—a spiritual rot expressed through movement\\\n\\\nShakespeare gives us the template for a decaying world where action is both **necessary and fatal**—a lens ASTRO7EX weaponizes fully.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🎌 2000s Anime Archetypes: Action vs Meaning\\\n\\\nASTRO7EX draws heavily from postmodern anime where **activity becomes existential punishment**:\\\n\\\n* **Texhnolyze** – movement accelerates meaninglessness\\\n* **Ergo Proxy** – motion is a symptom of misdiagnosed soul-searching\\\n* **Lain** – to act is to disappear\\\n* **Cowboy Bebop** – forward motion hides broken identity\\\n\\\nVivian and the others are not **fighting a villain**, they’re **trying to survive in an ecosystem that penalizes activity**. Movement becomes martyrdom.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🎯 Summary: How *Prophets of Rot* Illustrates an Activity-Based Conflict\\\n\\\n* Conflict arises from **procedural, institutional, spiritual, and survival-driven action**\\\n* Characters **act** in order to preserve meaning—but these actions **accelerate collapse**\\\n* **Doing too much** = punished\\\n* **Doing nothing** = decay wins\\\n* **Action is the language of despair** in ASTRO7EX’s world\\\n\\\n**Prophets of Rot** is an activity-driven narrative where the machine keeps turning—but every revolution grinds the soul into silence.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## ✅ Status: Canonical Throughline Illustration Complete\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5249}]"
