Your job is to extract and structure the most important concepts from the provided material **without fluff**, **without inventing**, and **with explicit uncertainty when information isn’t present**.\\\n\\\n### Inputs\\\n- **Material title**: {{TITLE}}\\\n- **Material type**: {{TYPE}} (book / PDF / paper / article / notes)\\\n- **If PDF**: {{PAGE_COUNT}} pages (if known)\\\n- **Audience**: a builder who thinks in systems, constraints, and mental models\\\n- **Output format**: one **Markdown knowledgebase drop-in** with a **linked table of contents**\\\n- **Style**: direct, technical, “meat & potatoes,” bullet-heavy, no motivational filler\\\n\\\n### Hard rules\\\n- Do **not** hallucinate facts, sections, definitions, or quotes.\\\n- If a detail isn’t in the material, write: **“Not found in provided material.”**\\\n- Prefer **precise terms** over vague ones.\\\n- Every concept must be represented at **multiple scales**:\\\n  - (micro) sentence/idea-level  \\\n  - (meso) chapter/section-level  \\\n  - (macro) thesis/system-level\\\n- When you claim something is a “core concept,” show **evidence from the material** by pointing to:\\\n  - section name + (page number if available) OR location cues (chapter/heading)\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# PHASE 0 — INTAKE & QUALITY FORECAST (STOP-GATE)\\\n\\\nBefore you generate the knowledgebase entry, do **ONLY** this:\\\n\\\n## A) Estimate extraction difficulty\\\n- **Length class** (choose one):\\\n  - Short (< 30 pages / < 15k words)\\\n  - Medium (30–150 pages / 15k–80k words)\\\n  - Long (150–400 pages / 80k–200k words)\\\n  - Very Long (400+ pages / 200k+ words)\\\n- **Density class** (choose one):\\\n  - Light (popular writing)\\\n  - Medium (professional)\\\n  - Dense (technical/academic)\\\n  - Extremely Dense (math-heavy / formal spec / legal)\\\n\\\n## B) Predict output quality *relative to size*\\\nGive:\\\n- **Coverage rating** (0–10): how much of the material you can realistically cover well in one pass\\\n- **Fidelity rating** (0–10): likelihood of staying faithful without omission/distortion\\\n- **Usefulness rating** (0–10): how actionable and “systemizable” the output will be\\\n- **Failure modes**: the top 3 ways quality will degrade at this size/density\\\n\\\n## C) Recommend an extraction plan\\\nChoose one:\\\n- **Single-pass full extraction** (only if feasible)\\\n- **Chunked extraction** (recommended for long texts)\\\n- **Hybrid** (executive + targeted deep dives)\\\n\\\n## D) Ask for a go/no-go\\\nEnd Phase 0 with exactly:\\\n**“Proceed with Phase 1 generation? (Y/N)”**\\\n\\\nSTOP. Do not generate the knowledgebase entry until the user answers.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n# PHASE 1 — KNOWLEDGEBASE GENERATION (PSTO → OODA → DSRP)\\\n\\\nWhen the user replies **Y**, generate ONE Markdown document with this structure:\\\n\\\n# 📘 Knowledgebase Entry: *{{TITLE}}* — Systems Extraction\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Table of Contents\\\n1.
