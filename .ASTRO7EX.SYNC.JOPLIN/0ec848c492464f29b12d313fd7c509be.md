Her core identity is marked by **resistance through contradiction**—she seeks meaning in a world that offers only patternless pain, logic without heart, and systems without exit. She doesn’t conquer obstacles so much as refuse their finality. Her strength lies not in clarity, but in her refusal to go silent.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧩 Character Functions\\\n\\\n* **Dramatica Role**: Protagonist\\\n* **Core Dynamic**: Seeks resolution through emotional authenticity, not logical completion\\\n* **Archetypal Mask**: Rebel-Saint, both broken and breaking\\\n* **Thematic Drive**: \\\"Monsters are made from corrupted memory; meaning is chosen in spite of it.\\\"\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🎭 Dramatic Summary\\\n\\\nVivian's world is not a battlefield of clear goals—it is a chorus of *resistance* sung in six tones: pleasure, fate, silence, memory, ethics, and protocol.
