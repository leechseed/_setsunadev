## Purpose of Ontological Layers

Ontological layers define **what kinds of truths exist in a story and which truths outrank others**.

They exist to:
- Prevent rule confusion  
- Stop character exceptionalism  
- Enforce thematic and systemic coherence  
- Provide a stable foundation for scaling  

If scaling answers *how far consequences spread*, ontology answers *what cannot change*.

## What “Ontological” Means in Narrative

In this framework, **ontology** refers to:

> The hierarchy of constraints that govern narrative reality, independent of presentation or taste.

Ontological layers answer questions like:
- What must always be true?
- What may change, and at what cost?
- What cannot be overridden by clever writing?

Ontological layers are **not story beats or techniques**.  
They are **structural facts about how the narrative universe operates**.

---

## The Ontological Layer Stack (Lowest → Highest)

From most fundamental (least flexible) to most expressive (most flexible):

> **Reality → Meaning → Power → Experience → Expression → Argument → Perception**

Lower layers constrain higher layers.  
Higher layers may express or interpret lower layers, but never alter them.

## Layer-by-Layer Definitions

---

## Layer 0 — Ontological Reality
**(Hard constraint layer)**

### Definition  
The fundamental rules of existence in the story world.

### Governs
- Reality / ontology  
- Time  
- Causality  
- Permanence  
- Entropy / decay  
- Scale invariance  

### Core Question  
> *What is true even if no one is alive to witness it?*

### Invariants Belong Here
- Time does not reverse  
- Actions have irreversible consequences  
- Decay cannot be fully halted  

### Failure Mode
- Retcons  
- Exceptions for protagonists  
- World rules that change to save plot

---

## Layer 1 — Value & Meaning Logic
**(Moral constraint layer)**

### Definition  
The system by which actions gain or lose significance.

### Governs
- Meaning  
- Values  
- Moral logic  
- Hope vs futility  
- Purpose  

### Core Question  
> *What does the universe reward, punish, or ignore?*

### Invariants Belong Here
- Success carries cost  
- Power corrupts outcomes  
- Hope is not guaranteed  

### Failure Mode
- Theme drift  
- Moral reversals without consequence  
- Genre incoherence

---

## Layer 2 — Power & Systemic Force
**(Authority and enforcement layer)**

### Definition  
The structures that determine who can cause change.

### Governs
- Power  
- Authority  
- Violence  
- Coercion  
- Institutions  
- Systems and enforcement  

### Core Question  
> *Who gets to decide what happens—and why?*

### Invariants Belong Here
- Power is asymmetrical  
- Systems resist disruption  
- Authority persists beyond individuals  

### Failure Mode
- Power fantasy escalation  
- Lone-hero system fixes  
- Unopposed protagonists

---

## Layer 3 — Human Interface
**(Experiential layer)**

### Definition  
How ontological rules are experienced by individuals.

### Governs
- Characters  
- Identity  
- Desire  
- Agency  
- Relationships  
- Trauma and emotion  

### Core Question  
> *What does it feel like to live under these constraints?*

### Important Rule  
> This layer **does not define invariants**.  
> It manifests constraints imposed by lower layers.

### Failure Mode
- Characters overriding systems  
- Psychology rewriting reality  
- “Special” characters immune to rules

---

## Layer 4 — Expression Mechanics
**(Transmission layer)**

### Definition  
How pressure and meaning move moment-to-moment.

### Governs
- Dialogue  
- Silence  
- Subtext  
- Action  
- Decision  
- Conflict mechanics  

### Core Question  
> *How is pressure transmitted right now?*

### Invariants Belong Here
- Speech is action  
- Conflict escalates  
- Silence has force  

### Failure Mode
- Decorative dialogue  
- Static scenes  
- Exposition replacing action

---

## Layer 5 — Structural Argument
**(Proof layer)**

### Definition  
How the story demonstrates its claim over time.

### Governs
- Structure  
- Progression  
- Arcs  
- Turning points  
- Throughlines  
- Payoff logic  

### Core Question  
> *What claim is the story making, and how does it prove it?*

### Invariants Belong Here
- Change is irreversible  
- All perspectives matter  
- Outcomes follow choices  

### Failure Mode
- Episodic drift  
- Unproven themes  
- False climaxes

---

## Layer 6 — Delivery & Perception
**(Epistemic layer)**

### Definition  
How the audience receives and interprets the story.

### Governs
- Point of view  
- Tone  
- Genre framing  
- Audience contract  
- What is hidden or unsaid  

### Core Question  
> *How is meaning framed for the audience?*

### Invariants Belong Here
- Fairness  
- Consistency  
- Earned payoff  

### Failure Mode
- Tone whiplash  
- Broken audience trust  
- Misdirection without setup

---

## Rules of Interaction Between Layers

1. **Lower layers constrain higher layers**  
2. **Higher layers express lower layers**  
3. **No layer may override a lower layer**  
4. **Violations propagate upward and destabilize scale**

If a higher layer requires changing a lower one, the system is broken.

---

## Common Ontological Violations

- Character growth altering moral physics  
- Tone demanding rule exceptions  
- Structure retconning causality  
- Dialogue explaining away systemic limits  

Most narrative incoherence is ontological, not stylistic.

---

## How Ontological Layers Support Scaling (Preview)

- Small scale activates higher layers only  
- Large scale activates deeper layers simultaneously  
- Scaling widens consequence radius without changing ontology  

The next knowledgebase entry will formalize **how scaling and ontological layers interact**.
