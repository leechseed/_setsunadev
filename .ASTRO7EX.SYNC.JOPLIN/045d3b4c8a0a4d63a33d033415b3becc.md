body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"Here’s exactly what I need from you to move forward cleanly, plus every open-ended question that affects the design. If you answer these (or upload the files that implicitly answer them), we can stop guessing and just build.\\\n\\\n## What to upload (minimum)\\\n\\\n1. **Your repo as a zip** (preferred), or at least these files:\\\n\\\n   * `app.py` (or whatever runs Streamlit)\\\n   * `db.py` / `database.py` (anything that connects to Postgres)\\\n   * `schema.sql` / `migrations/` folder if it exists\\\n   * `archetype_text.py` (the big dictionaries)\\\n   * any “logic” module: `astro_logic.py`, `bfas_logic.py`, etc.\\\n   * `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`\\\n2. **A database dump OR schema + seed**\\\n\\\n   * Best: `pg_dump --schema-only` and `pg_dump --data-only` (sanitized)\\\n   * Or: the SQL that creates tables + the SQL that inserts reference rows\\\n\\\nIf you can’t zip the repo, upload the folder contents as multiple files—still workable, just more annoying.\\\n\\\n## What I need from your environment (facts, not vibes)\\\n\\\n* What OS are you on (Windows/macOS/Linux)?\\\n* How are you running Postgres (local install / Docker / cloud)?\\\n* Postgres version?\\\n* Python version?\\\n* What’s the *one command* you run to start the app?\\\n\\\n## The real fork in the road (you must pick one direction)\\\n\\\n* Do you want to **stabilize the current V1 app first** (so it runs correctly today)?\\\n* Or do you want to **jump to Schema V2 immediately** (ref tables + library tables, less Python dict reliance)?\\\n\\\nBoth are valid. But mixing them mid-flight causes chaos.\\\n\\\n## Open-ended questions I need answered\\\n\\\n### A) Scope & “definition of done”\\\n\\\n1. What’s the next milestone you actually want?\\\n\\\n   * “App runs and shows planet/sign descriptions correctly”\\\n   * “Schema V2 exists + seeded + app reads from it”\\\n   * “Full migration: all lore + wiring + character data”\\\n2. What is the *minimum feature set* you consider “working”?\\\n3. What parts are “nice to have later” vs “must ship now”?\\\n\\\n### B) Source-of-truth rules\\\n\\\n4. In the end state, is the **source of truth**:\\\n\\\n   * Python dictionaries, or\\\n   * the Postgres tables?\\\n5. Are you okay with the DB being editable and becoming canon (meaning text changes live in DB)?\\\n6. Do you want versioning of lore text (history of changes) or just overwrite?\\\n\\\n### C) Data model decisions (this is where migrations succeed or die)\\\n\\\n7. What are the *canonical entities*?\\\n\\\n   * Planets only? Planets + nodes (SN) + Chiron + asteroids?\\\n8. Are things like `SN_...` and `CHIRON_...` treated as “planets” or a different category (“bodies/points”)?\\\n9. Do your variable keys always follow a strict pattern like `SUN_IDENTITY_AXIS`?\\\n10. Is `variable_key` globally unique forever, or can it change?\\\n11. Do you need to support multiple “libraries” (different lore packs / styles / tones)?\\\n12. Do you need multi-project support (ASTRO7EX vs other projects) inside the same DB?\\\n\\\n### D) Lore structure specifics\\\n\\\n13. For each zodiac sign, do you want to store:\\\n\\\n* just a sign description\\\n* plus the huge per-variable lore text\\\n* plus additional metadata (tags, tone, style, difficulty)\\\n\\\n14. Is lore text expected to be:\\\n\\\n* one paragraph per (planet, sign, variable)\\\n* or multiple entries per slot (variants)?\\\n\\\n15. Do you need templating in lore text (like `{character_name}` substitutions), or is it plain text?\\\n\\\n### E) Wiring / trait math specifics\\\n\\\n16. Where does the “wiring” currently live (which file/table)?\\\n17. Are weights static, or do you want them tunable by the user?\\\n18. Are weights per:\\\n\\\n* variable_key only\\\n* or variable_key + planet\\\n* or variable_key + sign\\\n* or variable_key + planet + sign\\\n\\\n19. Do you want resonance to scale linearly (volume/6) or something else?\\\n20. What is the authoritative list of BFAS traits/facets you support?\\\n\\\n### F) Character workflow (how users create/edit a character)\\\n\\\n21. How do you choose placements right now?\\\n\\\n* dropdowns? sliders? computed from birth time?\\\n\\\n22. Do you plan to compute placements from real natal chart data eventually?\\\n23. Can a user override placements manually?\\\n24. Do you need multiple characters, and do characters belong to “users” (auth/multi-user), or is this local solo?\\\n\\\n### G) Migration constraints\\\n\\\n25. Do you need to preserve existing character data from V1 tables?\\\n26. Is it okay if we wipe and reseed (dev-only), or must this be a safe migration?\\\n27. Do you want idempotent seeding (safe to run repeatedly without duplicates)?\\\n\\\n### H) UI expectations\\\n\\\n28. What must the UI show on the “planet card” / “sign card”?\\\n\\\n* title\\\n* description\\\n* variable breakdown\\\n* resonance controls\\\n\\\n29. Should the UI be able to **edit** lore text, or read-only?\\\n\\\n### I) Security / deployment\\\n\\\n30. Is this strictly local, or will you deploy it anywhere?\\\n31. Are you okay moving all credentials to `.env` and never hardcoding them again?\\\n32. Do you want Docker support?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## If you want the fastest path\\\n\\\nAnswer just these 6 first (everything else can follow):\\\n\\\n1. V1 stabilize or V2 migrate?\\\n2. Repo zip uploaded? (yes/no)\\\n3. Postgres version + how it’s running\\\n4. Where is the wiring currently defined? (file/table name)\\\n5. Are `SN` and `CHIRON` “planets” in your mental model?\\\n6. Must preserve existing DB character data or can we wipe dev DB?\\\n\\\nIf you upload the repo zip + a schema dump, I can stop asking most of this because the code will answer it.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5292}]"
