body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# Anal Gape Training – Depth, Control, and Endurance Protocol\\\n\\\n## Objective\\\nSafely and progressively train your body to accommodate deeper, wider anal penetration. Develop both passive gape (relaxed openness) and active control (muscular surrender).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Required Tools\\\n- Set of graduated plugs or dildos (3–6 sizes)\\\n- Water-based lubricant\\\n- Towel + pillow + mirror (optional)\\\n- Cleaning and sanitizing supplies\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Standard Session Protocol (20–30 min)\\\n1. **Preparation (5 min)**\\\n   - Hot shower or warm compress to relax muscles\\\n   - External anal massage (slow circular motion)\\\n   - Deep nasal breathing, pelvic rocking\\\n\\\n2. **Insertion Phase (10–20 min)**\\\n   - Begin with smallest plug or finger\\\n   - Insert slowly, breathe through resistance\\\n   - Hold each size for 3–5 minutes\\\n   - Advance sizes only when the current one feels comfortable and relaxed\\\n   - Do not force. **Gape is earned, not shoved.**\\\n\\\n3. **Stretch Phase (Optional, 5–10 min)**\\\n   - Insert largest tolerable toy\\\n   - Hold position, relax entire body\\\n   - Rotate gently or push/pull slightly for adaptation\\\n\\\n4. **Cooldown (3–5 min)**\\\n   - Remove toy slowly\\\n   - Light abdominal massage\\\n   - Sit or lie in reclining bound angle position\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Weekly Progression Guidelines\\\n| Week | Largest Size Tolerated | Hold Duration | Notes |\\\n|------|------------------------|----------------|-------|\\\n| 1    | Small plug             | 3–5 min        | Focus on breath and fear response |\\\n| 2    | Medium plug            | 5 min          | Increase lube, deepen pelvic relaxation |\\\n| 3    | Large plug             | 7–10 min       | Add mirror, build visual confidence |\\\n| 4    | X-Large / Deep Toy     | 10+ min        | Train endurance, stillness, opening reflex |\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Optional Enhancements\\\n- **Mirror Viewing**: Watch gape develop to build ownership\\\n- **Tapered Toys**: Hold at widest point for controlled tension\\\n- **Edging Pairing**: Link anal fullness to arousal without orgasm\\\n- **Breath-Moaning**: Exhale fully with sound to relax deeper\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Safety Reminders\\\n- Never train without full hygiene and toy sanitation\\\n- Stop if pain, bleeding, or involuntary cramping occurs\\\n- Use only non-porous toys with flared bases\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## Final Note\\\nTrue gape is not brute force — it's the art of letting go.  \\\nYou are training your body to open, hold, and **invite**.\\\n\\\n**Stretch slow. Relax deeper. Submit further.**\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2394}]"
