If yes, fold or cut.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## G) Montage/Reflection Integration (scene-safe)\\\nUse reflection beats as **scenes that obey the rules** (they still shift).\\\n\\\n- **RB Scene Job:** reveal world rule • externalize inner cost • reframe plan.  \\\n- **RB Scene Disruption:** music drop / visual glitch / timer tick alters intent.  \\\n- **RB Exit:** new readiness or new doubt → pushes next action.\\\n\\\n**RB Scene Card (mini):**  \\\n- **JOB:** ___  \\\n- **IMAGES (6–12):** line list  \\\n- **SOUND BED (3):** ___ / ___ / ___  \\\n- **SHIFT:** ___ (what changes in Vivian’s readiness/plan?)  \\\n- **HOOK:** ___\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## H) Pacing Controls (fast toggles)\\\n- **Speed up:** shorter lines, concrete verbs, cut conjunctions, punchy paragraphing.  \\\n- **Slow down:** longer syntax, sensory layering, space between actions.  \\\n- **Tension without speed:** withhold micro-info (what’s behind the door?) while action continues.  \\\n- **Clarity rescue:** “who/doing/where” rewrite on first line of any muddy block.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## I) Dramatica Alignment (per scene)\\\n- **OS (Physics/Obtaining):** Is the **work** visible? (tethers, burns, bribes)  \\\n- **MC (Universe/Present):** Is **constraint** on-screen? (paperless, ration caps)  \\\n- **IC (Fisherman/Mind):** One **correction** or value test in-frame.  \\\n- **RS (Psychology/Becoming):** Does this interaction **nudge** ward→operator?\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## J) Two Fast Examples (form only; fill with your details)\\\n**Action Paragraph (fast):**  \\\n> She straps. Breath clouds. Cable sings. A green tie flutters—the warning—then the hull kicks.\\\n\\\n**Reflective Paragraph (slow):**  \\\n> The tannoy lies in a warm hiss, counting tides that never match the dock. Her gloves remember the seam where the patch won’t hold.\\\n\\\n*(Swap with your images; keep the rhythm logic.)*\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## K) Session Flow (30–40 min loop)\\\n1) Fill **Scene Card** (5 min).  \\\n2) Run **Scene Sprints** 1–4 (15 min).  \\\n3) Draft scene (10–15 min).  \\\n4) Run **Paragraph Sprints** 2–3 + **Quality Gates** (5 min).  \\\n5) If reflective: fill **RB mini-card** (3 min) and ensure a **shift**.\\\n\\\n> Output: Scenes that turn. Paragraphs that carry charge. A beginning that doesn’t stall.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5856}]"
