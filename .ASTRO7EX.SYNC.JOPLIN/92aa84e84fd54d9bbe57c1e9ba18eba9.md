## **Application Grid**
| Seq/Scene | Device (FB/VO) | Rule Invoked (short name) | Appearance Trigger (emotion/structure/plot) | On-Screen Signal (format/motif) | New Info Delivered? (Y/N + what) | Redundant with Dialogue? (Y/N) | Notes/Fixes |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
|           |                 |                           |                                             |                                  |                                  |                               |            |
|           |                 |                           |                                             |                                  |                                  |                               |            |

## **Consistency Checklist**
- [ ] The device has **one clear rule** (or a tightly defined pair).  
- [ ] It **adds** info/irony/subtext not available in present-tense action.  
- [ ] **Appearance triggers** are consistent and legible.  
- [ ] Visual/aural **grammar** signals the device every time.  
- [ ] No **duplication** of information already in dialogue/action.  
- [ ] The device supports **theme** and **structure** (teaser/act breaks/end).  
- [ ] If bookended, **opening and closing** VO mirror or evolve each other.
