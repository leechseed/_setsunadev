## Terminology Primer (Read First)

- **Flow / Path** ‚Üí The intended **sequence** of attention through the frame.  
- **Entry / Exit** ‚Üí Where the eye first **enters** and finally **leaves** the image.  
- **Stepping Stones** ‚Üí Secondary accents staged to **lead** to the focal.  
- **Choke Point** ‚Üí A narrow high-contrast passage that **forces** the eye toward a target.  
- **Loop-Back** ‚Üí A design that **returns** attention to the focal instead of letting it exit.  
- **Reading Direction Bias** ‚Üí Viewers scan according to culture (LTR vs RTL). Design Z/F patterns accordingly.  
- **Value Contrast** ‚Üí Difference in light/dark; the #1 magnet for attention.  
- **Edge Sharpness** ‚Üí Crispness of boundaries; sharp = stronger pull.  
- **Vector** ‚Üí Any directional cue (line, gaze, gesture, motion blur, perspective).  
- **Saliency** ‚Üí The summed ‚Äúpull‚Äù from value, color, edge, detail, faces/text, etc.

> Rule: **Value contrast decides first stop; vectors decide direction; edges lock fixation.**

---

## How to Use This Guide
- Choose **one dominant** flow pattern that fits the subject and aspect ratio; layer **one or two** minor helpers.
- Make flow visible at the **Notan (3-value)** stage before detailing. If it doesn‚Äôt read there, it won‚Äôt read later.
- Always design **Entry ‚Üí Focal ‚Üí Secondary ‚Üí Loop-Back**. Add blockers if the eye leaks at borders.

---

## Choosing a Flow (Decision Map)

- **Elegant, sensual, scenic** ‚Üí **S-Curve**, **C-Curve**.  
- **Hero reveal / growth / vortex** ‚Üí **Spiral** (inward).  
- **Action, traversal, stairs, roads** ‚Üí **Zig-Zag**, **Diagonal Thrust**, **Vertical Cascade**.  
- **Screen/UI/poster scanning** ‚Üí **Z-Pattern** (LTR) or mirrored for RTL; **F-Pattern** for text.  
- **Monumental clarity** ‚Üí **L-Composition**, **Horizontal Sweep**.  
- **Impact/explosion or sanctity** ‚Üí **Radial Burst** (outward) or **Inward Radial**.  
- **Duality/tension/bounce** ‚Üí **Figure-8 / Axis-and-Orbit**.

## Patterns ‚Äî Construction, Feel, Use, Fixes

### 4.1 S-Curve / Serpentine
**What**  
A smooth S-shaped path that **meanders** to the focal.

**Feel**  
Graceful, sophisticated, ‚Äúline of beauty.‚Äù

**Build**  
- Lay an **S** using shoreline/road/gesture.  
- Put the **largest value jump** near the S‚Äôs **tightest turn** at the focal.  
- Keep edges softer at the entry, crisper near the focal.

**Mistakes**  
Over-straightening; competing micro-curves that dilute the main S.

**Fixes**  
Simplify side details; echo the S at smaller scales only near the focal.

**Contexts**  
Landscapes, fashion poses, creature spines, car ads.

**Checklist**  
- Can you trace one continuous S to the focal without detours?

---

### 4.2 C-Curve (Hook / Embrace)
**What**  
A single arc that **hooks** the viewer into a contained focal.

**Feel**  
Protective, intimate, or predatory (hook).

**Build**  
- Use a **curved foreground** or limb to cradle the focal.  
- Darker arc, brighter focal inside the bowl; edges sharpen toward the core.

**Mistakes**  
Focal merging with the arc; arc brighter than focal.

**Fixes**  
Drop arc contrast; add rim to focal; separate silhouettes.

**Contexts**  
Portraits with arm/veil framing, product with curved props.

**Checklist**  
- Does the arc **point and cradle** the subject rather than compete?

---

### 4.3 Circular Orbit (Loop)
**What**  
A round path that **circulates** attention around a center.

**Feel**  
Stable, meditative; can feel stagnant if misused.

**Build**  
- Arrange elements on a **ring**; keep center slightly **hotter** or cooler to set hierarchy.  
- Break the ring subtly near the focal to **enter**.

**Mistakes**  
Perfect uniformity; no entry point.

**Fixes**  
Create a **gap** or accent; vary one segment‚Äôs value/texture as an entry.

**Contexts**  
Wreaths, team clusters, UI dials, group shots around a table.

**Checklist**  
- Where do you enter, and does the loop return to focal?

---

### 4.4 Spiral (Inward/Outward Growth)
**What**  
Logarithmic spiral that **funnels** into (or bursts from) a core.

**Feel**  
Inevitable pull (inward), dynamism (outward).

**Build**  
- Match spiral orientation to gesture; **tight coil = focal**.  
- Step value/edge intensity along the arm toward the coil.

**Mistakes**  
Spiral forced against subject gesture; coil off target.

**Fixes**  
Mirror/rotate; move the focal **into the coil**; simplify outside turns.

**Contexts**  
Key art, product reveals, landscape rivers, smoke/light trails.

**Checklist**  
- Do lines **follow** the spiral and terminate at the coil?

---

### 4.5 Zig-Zag / Switchback
**What**  
Angular **left-right** steps climbing toward the focal.

**Feel**  
Energetic, rugged, progressive.

**Build**  
- Place **stepping stones** (value accents) in a staggered path.  
- Each step **decreases spacing** and **increases** sharpness toward the focal.

**Mistakes**  
Even spacing; last step pointing off-frame.

**Fixes**  
Vary intervals; rotate last step **toward** the focal.

**Contexts**  
Mountain trails, stairs, rally banners, manga action panels.

**Checklist**  
- Can you count clean beats that **accelerate** to the subject?

---

### 4.6 Z-Pattern (Screens, Posters)
**What**  
LTR cultures scan **left‚Üíright, down, left‚Üíright**.

**Feel**  
Clear, commercial, directive.

**Build**  
- Put **hook** at top-left, **hero/focal** at top-right or center-right, **secondary** mid-diagonal, **CTA/logo** bottom-right.  
- Value path brightens along the Z.

**Mistakes**  
Crowding mid-diagonal; burying the CTA.

**Fixes**  
Open whitespace on the diagonal; punch the bottom-right.

**Contexts**  
Hero web pages, posters, key art with tagline ‚Üí logo.

**Checklist**  
- Can you read hook ‚Üí hero ‚Üí CTA in one sweep?

*(Mirror for RTL languages.)*

---

### 4.7 F-Pattern (Text-Heavy Layouts)
**What**  
Readers scan like an **F**: top line(s), then down the left, skimming subheads.

**Feel**  
Efficient, informational.

**Build**  
- Align headings/subheads to an **F spine**; place key images on upper bars.  
- Keep side content low-contrast; highlight in-line links near top bars.

**Mistakes**  
Important content below the fold without anchors above.

**Fixes**  
Surface essentials in the **top bar**; use subheads as stepping stones.

**Contexts**  
Blogs, docs, dashboards, news.

**Checklist**  
- Are the **first two bars** doing the heavy lifting?

---

### 4.8 L-Composition (Corner Anchor)
**What**  
Strong **vertical + horizontal** forming an L that **cradles** content.

**Feel**  
Grounded, architectural, editorial clarity.

**Build**  
- Use building edge/tree (vertical) + horizon/desk (horizontal).  
- Place focal near the **corner** of the L; darken the legs outward.

**Mistakes**  
Focal sitting on the leg (tangent), not inside the corner.

**Fixes**  
Pull focal **inboard**; adjust values so legs recede.

**Contexts**  
Cityscapes, desk/product shots, UI hero with nav column.

**Checklist**  
- Does the L **hold** the focal without kissing tangents?

---

### 4.9 Diagonal Thrust (Baroque ‚Üó / Sinister ‚Üò)
**What**  
Dominant diagonal drives **directional energy**.

**Feel**  
Forward/up (‚Üó) or falling/foreboding (‚Üò).

**Build**  
- Align major edges/gestures to the chosen diagonal; add **reciprocals** to prevent monotony.  
- Place focal near a **diagonal‚Äìreciprocal** node.

**Mistakes**  
Everything parallel (boring); lines pointing out.

**Fixes**  
Introduce cross-beats; curve tips inward; add blockers at exits.

**Contexts**  
Sports/action, chase scenes, dynamic fashion/editorial.

**Checklist**  
- Is one diagonal clearly dominant, with counters to keep the eye inside?

---

### 4.10 Radial Burst / Inward Radial
**What**  
Lines **radiate** from or **converge** into a hub.

**Feel**  
Explosion (out), sanctum or destiny (in).

**Build**  
- Outward: hub hot, arms diminishing outward.  
- Inward: arms lead in; hub has **highest value jump**.

**Mistakes**  
Noisy arms overpowering hub; hub cluttered.

**Fixes**  
Simplify the hub; taper arm contrast; odd number of rays for cadence.

**Contexts**  
Mandalas, sunbursts, boss arenas, car wheels, title starbursts.

**Checklist**  
- Does the hub clearly **win**?

---

### 4.11 Figure-8 / Lemniscate
**What**  
A **double-loop** path that criss-crosses at a **pivot**.

**Feel**  
Duality, tension, romance, rivalry.

**Build**  
- Two loops with a **high-contrast crossing**; focal sits on or just after the pivot.  
- Balance loops with asymmetry (one smaller/hotter).

**Mistakes**  
Equal loops (stagnant); pivot too weak.

**Fixes**  
Heat one loop; boost value at pivot; add gaze vectors across the cross.

**Contexts**  
Two-character scenes, product vs environment, ‚Äúbefore/after‚Äù visuals.

**Checklist**  
- Do you feel a **bounce** through the pivot back to the focal?

---

### 4.12 Axis-and-Orbit (Center of Gravity)
**What**  
A dominant subject (axis) with **orbiting** accents.

**Feel**  
Authority, magnetism.

**Build**  
- Strong central focal (value/edge); smaller accents orbit with decreasing weight.  
- Use subtle arcs to connect satellites back to the axis.

**Mistakes**  
Satellites too bright/sharp; axis underemphasized.

**Fixes**  
Soften/ desaturate satellites; add rim/contrast to axis.

**Contexts**  
Hero product with accessories, leader with team, logo lockups.

**Checklist**  
- Is the axis undeniably **heavier** than any satellite?

---

### 4.13 Vertical Cascade
**What**  
Top-to-bottom **steps** (waterfall, stairs, banners).

**Feel**  
Descent, gravity, drama, hierarchy.

**Build**  
- Stage beats decreasing in size/spacing; brightest/ sharpest near the **target**.  
- Use mist/blur downward to suggest speed or weight.

**Mistakes**  
Even spacing; bottom exit.

**Fixes**  
Add a blocker or upward curl at the end; boost target contrast.

**Contexts**  
Waterfalls, skyscraper sequences, long UI menus.

**Checklist**  
- Do beats **accelerate** and then **stop** at the goal?

---

### 4.14 Horizontal Sweep
**What**  
Left-to-right or right-to-left **band** movement.

**Feel**  
Calm, breadth, travel; or relentless drive if contrasted hard.

**Build**  
- Keep horizon clean; use **value gradient** along the band toward focal.  
- Add foreground anchors to start the sweep.

**Mistakes**  
Horizon through heads; no start anchor.

**Fixes**  
Lower/raise horizon; plant a foreground lead-in.

**Contexts**  
Panoramas, convoy shots, timeline UIs.

**Checklist**  
- Is there a clear **start**, **mid anchor**, and **destination**?

---

## Diagnostics & Stress Tests
- **1-Second Read** ‚Üí Name the focal; if not, your flow is noise.  
- **Blur & Grayscale** ‚Üí The path should survive without color/texture.  
- **Arrow Pass** ‚Üí Draw arrows over every vector; kill/re-aim any outward arrows.  
- **Leak Test** ‚Üí Mask the center; do corners pull? Add blockers/vignettes.  
- **Beat Count** ‚Üí For step-flows (Zig-Zag/Cascade), count beats‚Äîare intervals **uneven** and **accelerating**?  
- **Pivot Strength** ‚Üí For Figure-8/Axis-Orbit, is the pivot/axis the **highest contrast** region?

---

## Exercises That Build Skill Fast
1. **One Scene, Five Flows**  
   - Recompose the same subject as S, Spiral, Zig-Zag, L, Diagonal. Compare in grayscale blur.

2. **Entry/Exit Lab**  
   - Make three versions that **enter** from different edges but end at the same focal. Study which reads fastest.

3. **Beat Builder**  
   - Lay a Zig-Zag with 5 beats. Vary spacing to accelerate. Swap which beat is brightest and note changes.

4. **Pivot Duel**  
   - Stage a Figure-8 for two characters; move the pivot and watch how power dynamics flip.

5. **Radial Surgery**  
   - Design a messy radial, then remove 30% of rays while preserving impact.

6. **Z vs F**  
   - Create a landing page twice: Z-pattern and F-pattern. A/B check first-click heat.

7. **Horizon Discipline**  
   - Shoot/paint 10 frames changing only horizon height; annotate how flow and mood change.

---

## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)
- **Multiple Competing Flows** ‚Üí Muddled path.  
  *Cure*: Pick **one** dominant; demote or delete the rest.

- **Color-Only Flow** ‚Üí Dies in grayscale.  
  *Cure*: Rebuild the path with **values and edges** first.

- **Even Beats** ‚Üí Marching band monotony.  
  *Cure*: Irregular intervals; crescendo toward focal.

- **Hot Corners / Edge Leaks** ‚Üí Attention exits.  
  *Cure*: Blockers, inward vectors, value compression at borders.

- **Forced Spiral** ‚Üí Overlay religion.  
  *Cure*: Match the spiral to the **gesture** or switch to triangle/diagonal.

- **Horizon Spearing Subjects** ‚Üí Kills silhouettes.  
  *Cure*: Move horizon; protect outlines.

---

## Workflow & Setup (Overlays, Apps, Camera/Lens)
- **Overlays**: PNG sets for **S**, **spiral**, **Z**, **F**, **L**, **diagonal armatures**, **radial**. Toggle them during thumbnails.  
- **Photoshop/Krita**: Use **Gradient Map** and **Gaussian Blur** for path tests; keep a ‚ÄúFlow‚Äù layer group (arrows, blockers, vignettes).  
- **Procreate**: Import flow overlays; use **Liquify/Push** to nudge vectors without redrawing.  
- **Cameras**:  
  - **Wide lenses** exaggerate lines (S, diagonal, L).  
  - **Tele lenses** compress for **Zig-Zag beats** and **Axis-Orbit**.  
  - Assign a custom button to toggle **level** and **grid**; use **AF point** to keep focal sharp.  
- **Storyboard/UI**: Build Z/F master templates; snap modules to them; test with grayscale wireframes first.

---

## Cheat Sheet Summary
- Pick **one** pattern that fits subject + aspect.  
- Build the route in **values**; reinforce with **edges**; steer with **vectors**.  
- Design **Entry ‚Üí Focal ‚Üí Secondary ‚Üí Loop-Back**; add blockers at exits.  
- For step-flows, **uneven intervals** and **acceleration** beat uniformity every time.  
- If it fails the **blur + grayscale + flip** triad, it‚Äôs not ready.
