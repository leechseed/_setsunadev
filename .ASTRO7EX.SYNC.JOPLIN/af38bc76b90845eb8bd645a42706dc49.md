## üß† Overview

Myrtle‚Äôs skills and occupations represent a unique narrative paradox: she is designed as an emotional echo and spiritual amplifier rather than a traditional agent of action. Her functions prioritize reception, subtle influence, and psychic containment over assertion or conquest. The addition of narrative astrology deepens this framework, casting Myrtle as an astral empath whose entire existence orbits around others' inner worlds and unspoken wounds.

## ‚úÖ Summary

Myrtle‚Äôs skills and occupations define her as a passive, supportive archetype whose power lies in being an emotional mirror and spiritual sanctuary rather than a leader or aggressor. Her abilities revolve around emotional absorption, resonance, and quiet influence, positioning her as an indispensable yet invisible backbone to ASTRO7EX's emotional structure. The narrative astrology reinforces this, depicting Myrtle as an ethereal constellation of service and echo, a ghost woven from others' forgotten grief and quiet hope.

## üåÄ Dramatica Summary (Paragraph Form)

Within the Dramatica framework, Myrtle‚Äôs skills and occupations reinforce her Sidekick role through soft power and spectral support rather than traditional heroic competencies. Her capacity for emotional resonance, empathic absorption, and quiet presence enables her to serve as both a stabilizing influence and a haunting mirror to Vivian‚Äôs internal journey. Rather than directly advancing plotlines through decisive action, Myrtle shapes the emotional landscape in which the story unfolds, inviting characters and audience alike to engage with vulnerability and collective grief. Her design as an emotional ghost and support entity makes her essential to ASTRO7EX‚Äôs deeper narrative argument about corrupted memory and the quiet, often invisible costs of devotion and self-erasure.
