ADDING BEGINNING

# ☕ Coffee Break Beginnings Kit — Ep.1 “Slumside Core”
**Use this to build a *pilot-caliber beginning* that moves like a thriller and breathes like a memory.**  
(Short sprints. No lore dumps. Concrete actions.)

---

## 0) The Five Commandments of Openings (Desk Card)
1. **Promise** — State tone/genre/stakes in the first 5 pages.  
2. **Disruption** — Begin with change; *something* is already shifting.  
3. **Micro-Story Scene** — Setup → conflict → beat of resolution → bigger question.  
4. **Character in Motion** — Open with the MC *doing* something that matters.  
5. **Voice & Clarity** — A distinct voice + zero confusion beats cleverness.

Tape this above your screen. Every opening choice must serve these.

## 1) Opening Placement Map (pilot first 12–15 min / ~12–15 pages)
- **p1–2: Cold Open (Disruption Onset)**  
  - Image punch + concrete action. (No “once upon a time” text.)
- **p3–5: Orientation & Promise**  
  - Who/where/what’s changing (through action), plus tone.  
- **p5–7: Inciting Incident**  
  - The “AI core ping / skyfall” opportunity hits.
- **p7–9: Stakes & Plan A**  
  - Quick, visible goal and immediate resistance.
- **p9–11: Reversal / Complication**  
  - Mudlark pressure or crew friction escalates.
- **p11–13: Commitment Beat**  
  - Vivian *chooses* (not drifts) to proceed → Act 1 door closes.
- **p13–15: Launch Into Run**  
  - Kinetic handoff into the body of the episode.

*Swap minute/page labels to your format if needed.*

## 2) Reflective/Montage Beats for a “Beginning”
Slot short breathers to deepen world/voice without stalling momentum.

- **RB-1 (p4–5) — Early Breather:** *Ritual Micro-Choreo*  
  - Insert-heavy: hands, paper keys, oilskin, breath on visor.  
  - **Purpose:** Establish *rules of place* via objects.
- **RB-2 (p8–9) — Choice Pause:** *Choice-Tilt*  
  - 6–10 images implying yes/no costs (no VO).  
  - **Purpose:** Externalize inner stakes before midpoint fray.

> Duration: 20–45s each; 6–12 shots; minimal/no dialogue; one new rule per beat.

---

## 3) First-Five-Pages Checklist (tick before moving on)
- [ ] **Actioned Orientation:** We know where we are, who’s moving, and what just changed.  
- [ ] **Promise Delivered:** Genre/tone unmistakable (grimy near-future salvage thriller).  
- [ ] **Tactile Specificity:** 3+ sense details (sound of tannoy, cable twang, slag rain).  
- [ ] **Goal Seeded:** A visible want (grab the classified core).  
- [ ] **Opposition Named/Implied:** Mudlarks or port friction appears in frame.  
- [ ] **Voice Lock:** Diction/rhythm consistent (no wobble between registers).  
- [ ] **RB-1 Placed:** One reflective beat that adds a world rule.

---

## 4) Opening Scene = Micro-Story Card (fill once)
**Setup (2–4 beats):**  
- [ ] Vivian doing ______ in ______ as ______ changes.

**Conflict (3–5 beats):**  
- [ ] Immediate pushback from ______ via ______.

**Resolution Beat (1–2 beats):**

**Bigger Question (tag):**  
- [ ] What the audience must know next (one line): ______.

---

## 5) Voice & Clarity Guardrails (apply line-by-line pass)
- **No static opens.** Every paragraph = action or choice.  
- **Concrete > Abstract.** Replace “dangerous” with “cable whips, sparks spit.”  
- **One new noun per sentence** in the first page (avoid jargon piles).  
- **Diegetic anchors** (radio, foghorn) guide J-cuts into scenes.  
- **Camera grammar:** close macro for ritual; 35–50mm for human scale.

---

## 6) World Without Lore Dumps (Beginning-Only Menu)
Add *one* rule per reflective beat from this menu:
- “Paper beats silicon here” (paper keys, seals, stamps).  
- “Tide table > tannoy” (locals trust the analog clock, not the PA).  
- “Green wire ties = Mudlark territory.”  
- “Bribes wrapped in fish paper get through faster.”  
- “No papers, no berth” (visualize denial, not an explanation).

---

## 7) Coffee-Break Sprints for the Beginning (5–7 min each)
1) **Image Bank 15 (Opening-only)**  
   - 15 concrete images you will actually shoot in p1–5.
2) **Ritual Recipe (RB-1)**  
   - 6 silent steps; last step reveals the *cost* of the ritual.
3) **Choice Board (RB-2)**  
   - 6 frames: 3 “say yes” costs / 3 “say no” costs (pure visuals).
4) **Sound Bed 12**  
   - Mark 3 for J-cuts; 1 for a full-stop silence.
5) **Action Verbs Pass**  
   - Replace 15 weak verbs with precise actions (strap, pry, wedge).
6) **Opposition Inserts**  
   - 8 quick shots that imply Mudlark presence without dialogue.
7) **Micro-Story Polish**  
   - Ensure first scene ends with a changed next choice.

---

## 8) Dramatica Alignment (Beginning-specific)
- **OS (Physics/Obtaining):** Show the *work* of earning the goal in p1–10.  
- **MC (Universe/Present):** Visualize constraints (paperless, ration caps) by p3.  
- **IC (Fisherman/Mind):** 1 silent correction before p6 (hand gesture, head shake).  
- **RS (Psychology/Becoming):** Tag p12–15 with a mentor→operator shift.

## 10) Quality Gates Before You Leave the Beginning
- [ ] I can **pitch p1–5** in one breath (no backstory required).  
- [ ] Audience can answer: **Who are we with? Where are we? What changed?**  
- [ ] There’s a **visible goal** and **named/seen resistance** by p7.  
- [ ] **Two reflective beats** add rules without halting momentum.  
- [ ] The opening scene **changes the next choice** (micro-resolution).  
- [ ] **Voice is consistent**; no jargon mush; images do the lifting.

### Quick Use Instructions
1) Do Sprints 1–3 (≈20 mins).  
2) Fill the **Opening Scene Card**.  
3) Place **RB-1 at p4–5** and **RB-2 at p8–9** using your image/sound lists.  
4) Write only the **connector beats** between anchors.  
5) Run the **Quality Gates**. Fix anything that fails.

> Result: a beginning that *promises*, *moves*, and *feels lived-in* — ready to carry the episode.
