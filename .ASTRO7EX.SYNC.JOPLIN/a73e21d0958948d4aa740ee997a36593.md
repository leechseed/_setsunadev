club licenses are **separate** and use a different call.\\\n- **Practical tip:** Your license ties to **your own FRN**; don’t reuse someone else’s.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## T1A05 — Proof of Your License\\\n**Correct Answer:** Listing in the FCC ULS database ✅\\\n\\\n- **What this encodes:** The **ULS database** is the **authoritative** source for license **status** (active, canceled, revoked).\\\n- **Why you study it:** Paper copies and VEC emails are **not legal proof**; ULS is.\\\n- **Practical tip:** **Create/remember** your **FRN + password** to track applications and renewals.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## T1A06 — Definition: Beacon\\\n**Correct Answer:** An amateur station transmitting for propagation/experimental activities ✅\\\n\\\n- **What this encodes:** A **beacon** is a transmission **for observing propagation** or related experiments (often **continuous CW**).\\\n- **Why you study it:** Tells you **what beacons are for** (not QSOs) and where you’ll **find them** (designated segments).\\\n- **Use case:** Check **band openings** (Sporadic-E, tropo, F-layer) without coordinating with another op.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## T1A07 — Definition: Space Station vs Earth Station\\\n**Correct Answer:** Amateur station located more than 50 km above Earth’s surface ✅\\\n\\\n- **What this encodes:** **> 50 km = space station**; **≤ 50 km = earth station** (amateur service definitions).\\\n- **Why you study it:** Different **rules/privileges/coordination** apply to space vs. earth stations (satellite ops).\\\n\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## T1A08 — Who Recommends Repeater/Aux Channels\\\n**Correct Answer:** Volunteer Frequency Coordinator recognized by local amateurs ✅\\\n\\\n- **What this encodes:** **Local/regional coordinators** publish **band plans** and **repeater pairings** to prevent interference.\\\n- **Why you study it:** You should **follow the local plan** to avoid stomping on repeater inputs/links.\\\n- **Test trap:** It’s **not** assigned by the FCC or ITU—**it’s volunteer & local**.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## T1A09 — Who Selects the Frequency Coordinator\\\n**Correct Answer:** Amateur operators in a local/regional area eligible for repeater/auxiliary stations ✅\\\n\\\n- **What this encodes:** **The community** (repeater/aux-eligible ops) **recognizes/selects** their coordinator.\\\n- **Why you study it:** Coordination is **bottom-up**, which explains **regional differences** in band plans.\\\n- **Practical tip:** Find your **area’s coordinator** before installing or moving a repeater/aux link.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## T1A10 — Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES): WTF Is It?\\\n\\\n**Question:** What is the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES)?  \\\n**Choices (all are correct):**\\\n- **A.** A radio service using amateur frequencies for emergency management or civil defense communications ✅  \\\n- **B.** A radio service using amateur stations for emergency management or civil defense communications ✅  \\\n- **C.** An emergency service using amateur operators certified by a civil defense organization as being enrolled in that organization ✅  \\\n- **D.** **All these choices are correct** ✅  \\\n\\\n- **What this encodes:** RACES is a **civil defense/emergency management** service defined in **Part 97.407** that uses **amateur frequencies, stations, and operators** when **authorized**.\\\n- **Why you study it:** During certain **national emergencies**, amateur activity can be restricted—**RACES may still be permitted** under government direction.\\\n- **How it works:** Ops must be **enrolled/authorized** by the **civil defense/emergency management** org; traffic is **limited to official emergency content**.\\\n- **Contrast:** **RACES** (government-directed, statutory) vs **ARES** (ARRL-organized volunteer program).\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## T1A11 — Willful Interference\\\n**Correct Answer:** At no time ✅\\\n\\\n- **What this encodes:** **Deliberate interference is never permitted**—no exceptions in Part 97.\\\n- **Why you study it:** Violations can mean **notices, fines, license actions**, and equipment seizure.\\\n- **Practical tip:** If you encounter QRM, **don’t engage**; **log, record**, and **report** through proper channels.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":6834}]"
