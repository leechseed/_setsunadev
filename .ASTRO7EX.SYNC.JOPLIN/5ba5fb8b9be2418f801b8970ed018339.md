## Purpose of This Document

This document explains the **narrative invariants** that govern the IP.

These invariants are not themes, morals, or aesthetics.  
They are **structural truths** that must remain valid across:

- dialogue
- scenes
- character arcs
- institutions
- history
- legacy

They exist to prevent:
- scale drift
- power creep
- reform fantasy
- heroic exceptionalism
- false closure

This document explains *what the invariants mean* and *how they constrain storytelling* without changing their wording.

---

## What Narrative Invariants Are

A **narrative invariant** is a rule about **how meaning behaves**, not about what happens.

Invariants:
- do not describe specific events
- do not prescribe plot outcomes
- do not tell characters what to believe

Instead, they describe **what kinds of victories, losses, and explanations are possible**.

If a story element contradicts an invariant and is allowed to stand, the IP is no longer coherent.

---

## Why This IP Uses Exactly Three Invariants

Three invariants form a **closed system**:

- one governs **action**
- one governs **system response**
- one governs **memory and legacy**

With fewer than three, escape hatches appear.  
With more than three, meaning fragments.

This structure mirrors durable narrative traditions (e.g., cyberpunk, noir, institutional tragedy) where the system itself is the primary antagonist.

---

## Invariant 1 — Explained

### Canonical Statement
> **If you play fair, the system wins.**

### What This Means

This invariant states that **legitimate systems cannot be defeated from inside their own rules**.

Fairness, compliance, and procedural correctness are not neutral virtues in this IP.  
They are **mechanisms of control**.

To act meaningfully, characters must:
- break rules
- act without authorization
- exploit blind spots
- accept illegitimacy

This does *not* mean cheating is good or justified.  
It means cheating is **necessary**.

### What This Prevents

- Reform narratives where policy fixes systemic injustice
- Heroes who “win clean”
- Moral comfort without consequence

If a character follows the rules and succeeds anyway, the story has violated this invariant.

---

## Invariant 2 — Explained

### Canonical Statement
> **The system will sacrifice people to prove it still works.**

### What This Means

This invariant states that **systems prioritize operability over human life or justice**.

When threatened, exposed, or destabilized, the system does not:
- self-correct
- admit failure
- accept responsibility

Instead, it:
- selects scapegoats
- assigns blame procedurally
- restores the appearance of function

The sacrifice is not a bug.  
It is the **mechanism of stabilization**.

### What This Prevents

- Bloodless systemic change
- Crisis resolution without victims
- Villain-only explanations for institutional harm

If a system survives a crisis without sacrificing someone, the story has violated this invariant.

---

## Invariant 3 — Explained

### Canonical Statement
> **The system decides who you were after you’re gone.**

### What This Means

This invariant states that **identity and legacy are not controlled by lived truth**.

After death, removal, or erasure:
- records outlive witnesses
- reports replace testimony
- narratives are standardized

The system gains uncontested authorship.

Intent, sacrifice, and inner truth do not protect identity from revision.

### What This Prevents

- Martyr vindication by default
- Truth “coming out” and fixing history
- Stable or accurate posthumous identity

If a character dies and is remembered correctly without struggle, the story has violated this invariant.

---

## How the Invariants Work Together

The three invariants form a **self-reinforcing loop**:

1. Playing fair guarantees loss → characters must cheat.
2. Cheating destabilizes the system → the system sacrifices people.
3. Sacrifice threatens legitimacy → the system rewrites identity.

There is no clean rebellion.  
There is no final truth-state.  
There is no stable outside perspective.

Every outcome feeds back into the system.

---

## Common Misuses and Failure Modes

Avoid the following:

- Treating invariants as themes instead of constraints
- Letting protagonists “earn” exemption
- Allowing reform to succeed without rupture
- Granting historical vindication as reward
- Using sacrifice as spectacle instead of mechanism

These errors soften the system and collapse tension.

---

## Practical Usage Rules

- **During writing**: ask which invariant is under pressure in the scene.
- **During editing**: remove outcomes that bypass cost, sacrifice, or revision.
- **During worldbuilding**: only add institutions that reinforce at least one invariant.
- **During revision**: if something feels comforting, interrogate it.

Comfort is usually a violation.

---

## Summary

These three invariants define the IP’s **moral physics**:

- Action requires illegitimacy.
- Systems stabilize through sacrifice.
- Identity is controlled after the fact.

They do not promise hope.  
They do not eliminate agency.

They define the **terrain on which meaning is fought**.
