 # Home Made Cum Lube
 https://www.reddit.com/r/BadDragon/comments/hvh6jx/homeade_cumlube_recipe_results/


 Posted again to get some more visibility. So I wanted to try a few different recipes to see if I could come up with a match for the BD Cum lube for the time being as they aren't selling it. I followed a recipe someone posted on here, which worked, and I wanted to see if I could improve on it. I am by no means a scientist and my recipes are approximations because I only had a crappy scale. I tested all of them anally with a M/M Opal Chance and a 200ml syringe ( xlube is good for vaginal play vs Jlube because Jlube has sugar base, but have no idea on PH content of this) Also I cant say much for shelf life because I used most of it right away. But here is what I found :

    ⁠All ingredients must be mixed before you add the Xlube otherwise it will seperate

    ⁠mixture needs to be at or near room temp before Xlube is added

    ⁠Don't mix the final mix in a bowl, it breaks up the lube. The best way is to add the mixture to a bottle, pour the xlube in, and then shake it until its mixed.

    ⁠It takes about 20 min for the lube to set up.

RECIPE 1: This one was posted and a good jumping off point

Water - 1 liter (1kg) - Distilled Water

X-lube - 5 grams (1 heaped capful) - Lube

Potassium sorbate - 1\8tsp (.625g) - Yeast Inhibitor for shelf life

Citric acid - .013g - to bring the PH into balance for the human body

White Food Coloring - 15 Drops

Conclusion - This is so close to the BD recipe its almost indistinguishable, The BD lube might be a little tiny bit more stringy but its close enough to not notice. The only distinguishable thing was that it dried out slightly faster than the BD lube.

Have brought this up from the bottom of another post - here is your sure fire quick mix recipe for ready to use, lump-free fisting strength JLube:

Simple JLube recipe

Proportions: I find 4 tablespoons of powder per litre is about right for fisting.  This gives a very slippery but not claggy mix that does not dry out.  Experiment with your own proportions once you have made this up.

Ingredients: Sorbolene moisturiser (the one litre supermarket packs are perfect), water, JLube powder.
Requirements: Stainless steel bowl, spoon or fork for mixing, a Bamix stick mixer or similar for a faster and smoother blend.

Method: 
Dollop around 50ml of moisturiser into the bowl (again you can refine quantities there is no "too much").
Mix in the JLube power with the spoon or fork to make a nice consistent paste. With the spoon, make sure there is no powder clinging to the bowl and it is all mixed into the paste. 
Add the water (no need to trickle it in, no need to boil it, just add plain cold water). 
Either mix with spoon to combine or blend it all in a quarter of the time with a stick mixer until you get a nice puree.
This should not take more than 10 minutes and you immediately get a ready to use, lump-free lube. Of course mixing it for longer gives a better product.
Decant into your play bottles. Perfect when someone unexpectedly drops in for a session. 

Advantages Anyone who has cooked and made a roux for a soup knows how this works - the JLube mixes instantly with the moisturiser, and they then both mix instantly with water, giving an immediate lump free lubricant that is ready to go.   No need to boil water.  No need to keep blending out lumps. No need to let stand for 24 hours.  The stick mixer is a refinement - but it does give a quick, perfect result.  Mixing by hand is ok, but takes more time is all.

Because this is so quick and simple, you don't have to make up large stocks in advance.  I generally make up about three litres at a time and decant into the play bottles.

Hope this helps.

I know some who add oil of cloves to this (nice natural relaxant).
