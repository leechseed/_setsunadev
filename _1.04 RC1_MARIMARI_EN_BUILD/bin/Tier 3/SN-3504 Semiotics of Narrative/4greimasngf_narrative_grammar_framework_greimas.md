### 1. **Greimas's Narrative Grammar Framework**

- **Narrative Grammar**:
  - **Definition**: Algirdas Julien Greimas extends structural semantics to include the concept of _narrative grammar_. He proposes that narratives, like sentences, possess an underlying grammatical structure that dictates how stories are constructed and understood. This structure serves as the foundation for the organization and progression of narratives, governed by rules similar to the grammatical rules of language. Greimas’s framework seeks to uncover the fundamental components and rules that drive a story’s flow, offering a systematic approach to narrative analysis.

---

### 2. **Key Concepts**

#### 2.1. **Transformations**

- **Definition**:
  - Transformations refer to the process by which a narrative moves from one state or situation to another. These changes often involve shifts in character roles, plot direction, or the resolution of conflicts.
