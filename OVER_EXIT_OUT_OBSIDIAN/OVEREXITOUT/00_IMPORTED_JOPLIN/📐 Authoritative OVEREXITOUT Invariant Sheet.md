# Layer 0 — Ontological Reality

**Hard constraint layer — defines what is possible**

### Ontology

**A promise never kept does not exist.**  
Reality recognizes only enacted outcomes; intent has no ontological weight.

### Causality

**Resistance reveals power; it does not erase it.**  
Opposition exposes scale and structure without guaranteeing removal.

### Time / Accumulation

**Left alone, power grows.**  
Inaction advantages existing structures through accumulation.

### Irreversibility / Cost

**You don’t walk away clean.**  
Every action leaves residue that alters the actor and the system.

### Entropy / Decay

**Integrity requires maintenance.**  
Stability persists only through continuous effort.

---

# Layer 1 — Value & Meaning Logic

**Moral constraint layer — defines what carries significance**

### Reward Logic

**The system rewards inputs, not beliefs.**  
Only enacted actions register; sincerity alone has no weight.

### Punishment Logic

**The system punishes withdrawal by letting it fail.**  
Disengagement forfeits protection; collapse proceeds unmitigated.

### Ignorance Logic

**The system ignores suffering.**  
Pain matters only when it alters outcomes.

---

# Layer 2 — Power & Systemic Force

**Authority layer — defines how power behaves**

### Persistence

**Truth does not interrupt enforcement.**  
Exposure does not pause power.

### Delegation

**Enforcement is outsourced.**  
Force operates through intermediaries; responsibility diffuses.

### Enforcement

**The system isolates threats.**  
Disruption is cut off from circulation rather than debated.

# Layer 3 — Human Interface

**Experiential layer — how reality feels**

This layer **does not define invariants**.  
It expresses how beings survive under Layers 0–2.

Typical manifestations include:

- Compression of identity under pressure
    
- Ritualization of survival behaviors
    
- Defiance without expectation of victory
    
- Transactional intimacy
    
- Dissociation as coping
    
- Stubborn continuity
    
- Quiet delusion as stabilization
    

Layer 3 produces **meaning**, not **leverage**.

# Layer 4 — Expression Mechanics

**Transmission layer — how pressure moves moment to moment**

Transmission moves carry constraint forward. They do not create justice or hope.

|Move|Core Function|
|---|---|
|**Commit**|Possibility becomes obligation|
|**Refuse**|Cooperation is denied|
|**Reveal**|Information creates exposure|
|**Delay**|Time increases pressure|
|**Escalate**|Stakes intensify|
|**Isolate**|Reach is cut off|
|**Transfer Risk**|Consequences move without stopping|
|**Close**|Options permanently narrow|

---

# Layer 5 — Structural Argument

**Proof layer — what the story demonstrates over time**

A narrative proves claims through repetition, consequence, and risk.

|Claim Type|What It Proves|
|---|---|
|Constraint|Some outcomes are impossible under structure|
|Cost|Survival requires irreversible loss|
|Power|Systems overpower individuals|
|Legibility|Only what enters the system counts|
|Agency|Choice exists but within constraint|
|Persistence|Systems outlast exposure|
|Meaning|Belief survives without leverage|
|Collapse|Structures fail only when dependencies break|

---

# Layer 6 — Terminal States

**Resolution layer — how pressure can end**

Terminal states describe structural outcomes, not moral ones.

|Code|Terminal State|Description|
|---|---|---|
|L6.1|**Containment**|Disruption absorbed; system holds|
|L6.2|**Attrition**|Survival continues through erosion|
|L6.3|**Exhaustion**|Opposition stops without resolution|
|L6.4|**Displacement**|Problem relocates; logic persists|
|L6.5|**Adaptation**|System absorbs and strengthens|
|L6.6|**Fragmentation**|Local coherence breaks; system remains|
|L6.7|**Collapse**|Core sustaining condition fails|
|L6.8|**Replacement**|Structure swaps; function persists|

# Cross-Layer Rules

- Higher layers **express** lower layers; they never override them.
    
- Meaning never automatically converts into power.
    
- Emotional truth cannot change systemic behavior.
    
- Structural change requires dependency failure, not revelation.
    
- Endings resolve **pressure**, not **reality**, **power**, or **invariants**.
