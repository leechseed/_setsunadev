## Core Distinction

|Concept|Scope|Changes What?|Narrative Layer|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Movement**|World / System Phase|The _operating rules of pressure_|Macro / Structural|
|**Origin Story**|Character Phase Shift|The _character’s identity & trajectory_|Mid-scale / Character|

A **Movement** changes what kind of survival is possible.  
An **Origin** changes who the person becomes inside that reality.

**Movements are systemic eras.  
Origins are personal transformation events.**

They operate on different narrative layers and should not be confused.

---

## The Rule of Origins

> **An origin story is a personal reconfiguration CAUSED by the systemic conditions of a specific Movement.**

Origins are **pressure conversions**:

**Systemic Pressure (Movement)** → **Identity Fracture** → **New Character Form**

The correct design question is not:

> “Is this a Movement?”

But:

> **“Which Movement’s pressures create this origin?”**

---

## Movement-Based Origin Types

Each Movement naturally produces a different kind of character transformation.

---

### Movement 1 — Acquisition Origins

**Type:** The Dream Origin  
**Function:** Why the character entered the system  
**Energy:** Hope, ambition, hunger, belonging

These origins are aspirational, not traumatic.

Examples:

- “I want to be the best.”
    
- “I want to be seen.”
    
- “I want to matter.”
    

This creates **the version of them that still believes in the system**.

---

### Movement 2 — Constraint Origins

**Type:** The Conditioning Origin  
**Function:** When the character learns to live inside rules  
**Energy:** Adaptation, compromise, internal conflict

This is where they:

- Learn silence
    
- Accept unfairness
    
- Trade part of themselves for stability
    

This creates **the version of them that can function within the system**.

---

### Movement 3 — Corruption Origins

**Type:** The Disillusionment Origin  
**Function:** When they realize the system is rotten  
**Energy:** Betrayal, clarity, powerlessness

This is where:

- Truth is discovered
    
- Faith dies
    
- Cynicism is born
    

This creates **the version of them that can’t un-know the truth**.

---

### Movement 4 — Awakening Origins

**Type:** The Survival Origin  
**Function:** When the system targets them personally  
**Energy:** Shock, loss, erasure

Often the **true “protagonist origin.”**

This is where:

- A loved one dies
    
- Identity is erased
    
- They become fugitive, weapon, or “Noise”
    

This creates **the version of them that cannot go back**.

---

### Movement 5 — Resistance Origins

**Type:** The Radicalization Origin  
**Function:** When they stop believing in fairness entirely  
**Energy:** Anger, ideology, rejection of legitimacy

This is where:

- They choose impact over justice
    
- They form or join insurgency
    
- They accept collateral damage
    

This creates **the version of them willing to burn the system**.

---

### Movement 6 — Collapse Origins

**Type:** The Final Form Origin  
**Function:** When they become a historical force rather than a person  
**Energy:** Attrition, myth, fragmentation

This is where:

- They become legend, ghost, martyr, or symbol
    
- Their identity dissolves into consequence
    

This creates **the version of them the world remembers — not who they once were**.

---

## Practical Placement Method

For each major character, ask:

1. **When did they still believe in the system?** → Movement 1 or 2
    
2. **When did they realize the system is corrupt?** → Movement 3
    
3. **When did the system hurt them personally?** → Movement 4
    
4. **When did they decide fairness doesn’t matter?** → Movement 5
    
5. **When did they stop being a person and become an outcome?** → Movement 6
    

A character may have **multiple origins**, each tied to a different Movement.

In systemic narratives, identity does not form once —  
it mutates under successive eras of pressure.

---

## Final Structural Rule

> **Movements are eras of systemic pressure.  
> Origins are moments when a character mutates to survive that era.**

Do **not** turn origin stories into Movements.

Instead:

> **Attach each origin to the Movement that makes that version of the character inevitable.**
