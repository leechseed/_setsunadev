## Purpose of Phase 1

**Goal**: Turn your current scuffed-but-playable Flicker Strike Champion into a **stable, profitable mapper** that can consistently generate currency without falling apart.

- You are **not** chasing “best in slot.”
- You are **not** crafting.
- You are **not** min-maxing.

You are:

- Plugging obvious leaks (resists, life, flasks).
- Equipping a **real** 2H axe instead of trash.
- Tightening your mapping loop so chaos → divines is guaranteed over time.

---

## Success Criteria to Leave Phase 1

You are done with Phase 1 when:

1. **Currency**
   - You have **3+ Divines** worth of currency/value (liquid + obvious sellables).
2. **Survivability**
   - Elemental resists capped in maps (75%+).
   - Life is at least ~4.5k+ (ballpark; depends on your exact level).
3. **Weapon**
   - 2H axe with at least **400–500 PDPS**.
4. **Hit/Crit**
   - Hit chance close to **100%** in PoB on main setup.
5. **Mapping Feel**
   - T10–T14 maps are smooth.
   - Deaths feel like your mistake, not constant gear failures.

If you don’t meet those, you’re not leaving Phase 1. Period.

---

## Pre-Phase Checklist (Before You Spend Anything)

Before you start throwing chaos around:

1. **Open PoB with your current character.**
2. Verify:
   - Your **main Flicker Strike setup** is correctly imported.
   - You can swap gear in PoB and see impact on DPS, hit chance, and EHP.
3. **Set up your loot filter.**
   - Use a semi-strict filter:
     - Show currency, scarabs, essences, maps, 6-sockets, jewels, decent bases.
     - Hide 99% of rares.
4. **Clean your stash.**
   - Dump *everything* into a “junk” tab.
   - Make a new tab called `PHASE_1_SELL`.
   - Make a tab called `PHASE_1_CURRENCY`.

You are going to treat this like a project, not hoarder mode.

---

## Step 1 – Fix the Foundation (Life, Resists, Flasks)

### 1.1 Check Your Defenses in PoB

In PoB, for your current gear:

- **Life**: if you’re under ~4k at red maps, that’s a problem.
- **Resists** (with flasks off):
  - Fire/Cold/Lightning **≥ 75%** (capped).
  - Chaos resist doesn’t need to be high in Phase 1, but being **≥ 0%** is nice.

If this is not true, gear upgrades go to **defense first**.

---

### 1.2 Flasks – Non-Negotiable Setup

You need **functional** flasks before big damage:

- **Life Flask**
  - Instant or semi-instant life.
  - “of Staunching” (bleed removal) or equivalent.
- **Utility Flasks** (any 3–4 from below)
  - Granite (armour), Jade (evasion), Basalt, Quartz.
  - Quicksilver (movespeed).
- **Suffixes**
  - Bleed removal on *one* flask.
  - Freeze removal on *another*.``
  - Then fill with:
    - Increased armour/evasion./
    - Reduced effect of curses.
    - Movement speed.

Roll them to something “good enough.” Do not obsess here. Just **functional**, not perfect.

---

## Step 2 – Buy a Real Weapon (400–500 PDPS)

Right now, weapon is your biggest damage lever.

### 2.1 What You’re Looking For

For **Phase 1**, target:

- Base: **Fleshripper** or other solid 2H axe.
- **Total PDPS**: at least **400–500**.
- Mods you care about:
  - High **% increased Physical Damage**.
  - Decent **flat added Physical Damage**.
  - Some **Attack Speed**.
  - Some **Crit Chance** if possible.

You do **not** need multi-influence, “double damage”, or mirror-tier garbage. You need a **sledgehammer**, not Excalibur.

---

### 2.2 Budget & Discipline

- Expect to spend **30–50c** on a perfectly fine Phase 1 weapon.
- Do *not* sink more than ~1 divine into a Phase 1 axe.
  - If you see yourself spending more than that, you’re jumping ahead into Phase 2/3 logic and wasting your economy curve.

---

### 2.3 Sanity Check in PoB

Once you’ve bought a candidate:

- Slot it in PoB:
  - Check DPS jump on Flicker Strike.
  - Check hit chance (if it tanks, you need more accuracy elsewhere).
- If the DPS barely moves, your tree/gems might be the bigger issue; but for Phase 1, the weapon almost always does heavy lifting.

---

## Step 3 – Rings, Amulet, Belt (Core Stat Blocks)

These three slots often carry **accuracy, flat phys, resists, and life**. You’re not crafting, you’re buying cheap but efficient rares.

### 3.1 Rings (High Priority)

Each ring should ideally have:

- **Required**
  - Life.
  - Resists.
  - Accuracy rating.
- **Nice to Have**
  - Flat phys to attacks.
  - Attack speed.
  - Attributes (str/dex/int if you’re short).

If your accuracy is low in PoB (hit chance < 95%), rings are **your fix.**

---

### 3.2 Amulet

Look for:

- Life.
- Flat phys.
- Crit multi or generic damage.
- Attributes if needed.
- Some resist if you can get it.

Anoint: choose something cheap and useful for now (e.g. small life/attack nodes). Don’t blow expensive oils at Phase 1.

---

### 3.3 Belt

For Phase 1, the belt is a **defensive anchor**:

- Life.
- 2–3 high resist rolls.
- Maybe some flask stuff or armour.

Cheap, high-life, triple-res belts exist. Don’t overcomplicate it.

---

## Step 4 – Quick Passive Tree & Gem Check

You’re not redoing your whole tree in Phase 1. You’re just making sure nothing is **extra stupid.**

### 4.1 Passive Tree Sanity

In PoB, check:

- Are you taking:
  - Life wheels near Duelist/Marauder?
  - Axe/2H clusters that actually affect your weapon?
- Are there any:
  - +minion damage.
  - Spell damage.
  - Useless keystones?

If yes, respect a few points into something that actually helps: life or axe damage.

---

### 4.2 Gem Links

Phase 1 goal: **proper 5L or 6L Flicker Strike** with coherent support gems.

At minimum, your Flicker link should look like a real attack setup, not:

- Flicker + random garbage supports.

If you have scuffed colors, **fix sockets/links** on your chest or axe to fit a sane Flicker Strike 5L/6L.

---

## Step 5 – Map Selection & Atlas Strategy (Phase 1)

You aren’t doing galaxy brain here. You are doing **fast, repeatable, low-brain** mapping that prints chaos.

### 5.1 Map Tier

- Aim: **T8–T14**.
  - High enough to drop decent loot.
  - Low enough to avoid constant rips if defenses aren’t fully online.

---

### 5.2 Layout Preference

Pick **open, linear maps** so Flicker can actually do its thing:

- Dunes.
- Strand.
- Tropical Island.
- Beach.
- Burial Chambers.
- Whatever similar layouts you have.

Avoid early on:

- Maze-like or multi-floor maps.
- Map bosses that require a ton of downtime and mechanics.

---

### 5.3 Atlas Tree Priorities

Phase 1 priorities:

- **Essences** – always worth stopping for.
- **Strongboxes** – big currency spikes, especially with Atlas nodes.
- **Shrines** – Flicker + shrines = trivial clears.
- **Harbinger/Abyss** – if you enjoy them and can handle them safely.

Do **not** invest into high-juice Delirium, insane altars, or double-rippy mechanics until Phase 2/3.

## priority
Harbinger/Abyss
Strongboxes
Shrines
Essences

---

## Step 6 – Loot Discipline & Selling Loop

You’re trying to get to **3 Divines**. Not admire the shape of every yellow item.

### 6.1 What You Always Pick Up

Every map, without overthinking:

- All currency.
- All scarabs.
- All essences (except true garbage, if you want).
- All maps.
- All 6-socket items (vendor for Jeweller’s).
- Rare **jewels**, **cluster jewels**, and notable bases (axes, amulets, belts) if you can tolerate small ID overhead.

Everything else: your filter should mostly hide it anyway.

---

### 6.2 Stash Workflow

After each batch of maps:

1. Dump all loot into `PHASE_1_SELL`.
2. From there:
   - Convert 6-sockets to Jeweller’s.
   - ID **only**:
     - Rare jewels / clusters.
     - Obvious “this could be crazy” items (high-ilvl weapon bases, influenced amulets, etc.).
3. Anything not obviously good → sell to vendor or ignore.

You are optimizing **time → currency**, not “check every rare like it’s 2013.”

---

### 6.3 Converting to Divines

As you accumulate chaos:

- Every time you hit ~150–200c, consider converting to a **Divine** or near-div value:
  - Sell chaos for divines if rates are decent.
  - Keep some chaos (~50–80c) for small purchases and maps.

The point is to **see your real progress**, not just sit on 600 unorganized chaos.

---

## Step 7 – Daily Operational Loop

This is what an actual session in Phase 1 should look like.

### 7.1 Before Mapping

1. Check flasks:
   - Charges.
   - Correct suffixes.
2. Check:
   - You’re on correct Flicker setup.
   - Auras on.
   - Blood Rage setup ready.

---

### 7.2 While Mapping

- Focus:
  - Positioning and pathing (where Flicker will bounce).
  - Not face-planting into obvious death zones.
- Always:
  - Click essences.
  - Open strongboxes (with a little caution).
  - Grab shrines.

Ignore:

- Long-winded side content that breaks your tempo (especially if you die to it).

---

### 7.3 After Every 3–5 Maps

1. Dump loot into `PHASE_1_SELL`.
2. Do quick vendor passes:
   - Sell 6-sockets.
   - Convert stuff you know is garbage.
3. Check currency tab:
   - Track your progress in chaos + div.

If the build feels noticeably better and your chaos is rising faster than you spend it, Phase 1 is working.

---

## Common Mistakes in Phase 1

1. **Overspending on “perfect” early gear.**
   - You’re not here to roll T1 everything.
   - You’re here to stop bleeding and start earning.

2. **Ignoring defenses.**
   - A 700 PDPS axe is worthless if you’re dead every map.
   - Resists and life are not optional.

3. **Looting too much trash.**
   - Time spent ID’ing junk = div/hour down the drain.
   - Use a stricter filter and respect your time.

4. **Trying to run top-end juice too early.**
   - You do **not** need 60% delirious maps right now.
   - You need stable, repeatable T10–T14 farm.

5. **Chasing crafts instead of just buying.**
   - In Phase 1, crafting is almost always a currency sink, not a generator.

---

## Transition Trigger – When to Start Phase 2

Move to Phase 2 (3d → 15d) **only** when:

- You have **≥ 3 Divines** worth of currency.
- You’re:
  - **Capped resists**.
  - ~4.5k+ life (or appropriate for level).
  - Hit chance near 100%.
  - Running T10–T14 with **low death frequency**.
- Flicker feels **mostly stable**, even if damage isn’t insane yet.

At that point, you’ve done your job:  
Phase 1 is complete. You’ve built a **reliable money printer**.  

Phase 2 is where we start leaning into real damage and the “Farrul’s + high PDPS axe” identity.

--- avoid these map modifiers

❌ Avoid these:

Elemental reflect (insta-delete yourself)

No leech (you WILL die)

Reduced max res (dangerous for flicker)

-#% block or armor (scales incoming spikes)

Players cannot regenerate life/mana (annoying)
