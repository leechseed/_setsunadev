# **Overview**
This guide condenses the raid loop of *ARC Raiders* into simple mental models designed to make every raid more efficient, safer, and more profitable.

---

# **Core Mental Model**
## **“Plan → Prioritize → Path → Pull Out.”**

A raid succeeds based on four decisions:

- **Plan:** Know your intended outcome.  
- **Prioritize:** Focus on goals that matter.  
- **Path:** Choose routes that minimize risk.  
- **Pull Out:** Extract with what you earned.

---

# **Planning Your Raid**

### **Why a Plan Matters**
Entering without a goal leads to:
- Wasted time  
- Unnecessary fights  
- Inefficient material collection  
- Failure to progress quests or workshop upgrades  

### **Typical Raid Goals**
- **Character progression** (XP, skills, quests)  
- **Material farming** (components, ammo, healing)  
- **Workshop expansion** (blueprints, weapons, attachments)

### **Principle**
You don’t need a perfect plan — **you need direction**.

---

# **Time Management & Extractions**

## **Mental Model:**  
**“The real boss is the timer.”**

### **Key Concepts**
- Spawn times vary (16–30 minutes).  
- When the timer hits zero → instant death, no cinematic.  
- Bodies cannot be looted if death occurs at timeout.  
- Check extracts immediately at spawn to plan your route.

### **Hatch Keys**
- Open in 2 seconds  
- Extract in 2 seconds  
- Best emergency escape item  
- **Disabled during Night Raids**

### **Extraction Timing Benchmarks**
- **Manual extraction:** Call at **1:30** remaining.  
- **Auto extraction:** Call at **3:00–2:55** for auto-close.  

---

# **Weapon Upgrading Strategy**

## **Mental Model:**  
**“Power increases… and so does upkeep.”**

### **Facts**
- Weapons upgrade up to **Mark 4**.  
- Higher Mark = more durability + bonus effects.  
- Higher Mark = **more expensive repairs**.

### **Optimized Approach**
- Repair **before** upgrading.  
- Fully upgrade guns you plan to keep long-term.  
- Avoid fully upgrading disposable or high-risk guns.

---

# **Blueprint Logic & Strategy**

## **Mental Model:**  
**“Blueprints are RNG lottery rolls.”**

### **Rules**
- Found across almost all unopened containers.  
- Also appear in Surveyor bodies.  
- No themed logic (weapon BPs do NOT only appear in weapon crates).  
- Duplicates can be sold or shared.  
- Always safe-pocket unlearned blueprints.

### **Testing Confirms**
- **Spawn-on-open RNG** is correct.  
- Blueprints have no fixed spawn points.

### **Practical Rule**
More unopened containers opened = **more blueprint chances**.

---

# **Materials, XP & Progression**

## **Mental Model:**  
**“Materials flow naturally if you follow your goals.”**

### **XP**
Everything provides XP:
- Searching  
- Fighting ARC  
- Crafting  
- Exploration  

### **Materials**
ARC components break down into base parts:
- ARC Alloy → metal  
- Thermo Lining → fabric  
- Coolant → chemicals  
- Couriers, Probes, Husks → mixed ARC components  

### **Actual Grind**
- **Projects** (long-term tasks)  
- **Trials** (season progression)

---

# **Stealth, Combat & Survival**

## **Mental Model:**  
**“Discretion is DPS.”**

### **Why You Should Avoid Fights**
- You are fragile, even with shields.  
- Shields mitigate damage; they don’t prevent it.  
- Gunfire attracts ARC and players.  
- Downing a player triggers a loud, visible **death flare**.  

### **Stealth Practices**
- Move quietly (avoid running unless escaping).  
- Use firefights elsewhere as distractions.  
- Throw manual flares to misdirect.  
- When downed, crawl to a hidden spot to deny loot.  
- Favor weapons with high **stealth rating**.

### **Suppressors**
- Cannot silence a weapon.  
- Simply reduce detection radius.

---

# **Field Crafting & Mid-Raid Sustain**

## **Mental Model:**  
**“Crafting is your emergency life-support.”**

### **What You Can Craft Mid-Raid**
- Basic bandages  
- Shield chargers  
- Fabric → small healing  
- ARC Powercells → small shield recharge  

### **Shield Durability**
- Heavy hits drain shield durability quickly.  
- Zero durability = shield disabled until repaired in town.

---

# **The Seven Laws of Good Raiding**

1. **Know your goal before you load in.**  
2. **Check extracts and plan your escape immediately.**  
3. **Use Hatch Keys unless it's a Night Raid.**  
4. **Upgrade weapons thoughtfully — repairs scale with Mark.**  
5. **Blueprints are RNG — open more containers.**  
6. **Stealth beats aggression — sound gets you killed.**  
7. **Field crafting keeps you alive long enough to extract.**

# LOOP
 First simple loop
Free gear
I assume u stared with free gear. Free starting gear has basic gray "augment" but I like to call them "backpacks" (I may sometimes use this word in guide for an augment).

Loop:

    Play with free gear
    Loot and survive
    Upgrade gear
    Change weapon if u want
    Get more ammo / healing items
    Raid again.
