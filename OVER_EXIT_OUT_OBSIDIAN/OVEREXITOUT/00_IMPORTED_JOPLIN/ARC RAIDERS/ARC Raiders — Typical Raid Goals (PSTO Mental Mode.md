# **Overview**
This entry breaks down the three primary raid goals in *ARC Raiders* using the **PSTO Mental Modeling Framework**:  
**Policy → Strategy → Tactics → Operations.**

Each goal becomes:
- **Policy:** The “why.” The underlying principle guiding decisions.  
- **Strategy:** The “what.” The high-level approach.  
- **Tactics:** The “how.” Mid-tier methods and patterns.  
- **Operations:** The “do it now.” Concrete in-raid behaviors.

This structure allows you to quickly select a raid purpose and act decisively.

---

# **Mental Model Framework**
Everything in ARC Raiders can be simplified into one guiding meta-model:

## **“Plan → Prioritize → Path → Pull Out.”**
## Loot to Live, Don't Live to Loot. 

For each raid goal:
- **Plan:** Choose which goal you’re pursuing.  
- **Prioritize:** Focus only on actions that serve that goal.  
- **Path:** Route efficiently toward that end.  
- **Pull Out:** Extract safely once your quota is met.

PSTO is the internal logic system for executing that model.

---

# **Goal 1 — Character Progression**
XP • Skills • Quests

---

## **Policy (1)**  
Progress compounds permanently; loot does not.  
Every raid should push your **character** forward, even if material rewards are mediocre.

---

## **Strategy (1)**  
- Anchor every raid around **1–2 quests**.  
- Route through **high-interaction zones** (containers, ARC hotspots) for XP gains.  
- **Extract early** once a key quest step is secured.  
- Ensure that every raid contains at least **one irreversible gain** (XP / quest / skill).

---

## **Tactics (1)**  
- Use **quest-first routing:** spawn → nearest quest node → second node → extract.  
- “XP Layering”: loot containers while traveling; take opportunistic ARC fights.  
- Safe-pocket quest items immediately.  
- If progression stalls mid-raid → pivot to XP farming and extract.

---

## **Operations (1)**  
- Open every unopened container in your path.  
- Interact with ARC only when it’s safe or quest-related.  
- Complete one quest step → re-check extract availability → leave.  
- Avoid PvP unless unavoidable.

---

# **Goal 2 — Material Farming**
Components • Ammo • Medicine • Breakdown Parts

---

## **Policy (2)**  
Consistency > jackpot.  
Materials fuel workshop upgrades and survivability; losing them wastes time.

---

## **Strategy (2)**  
- Farm **specific areas** based on material category tags (medical / industrial).  
- Hunt **renewable ARC units** (Probes, Couriers, Husks).  
- Use shorter, repeatable routes instead of deep risky dives.  
- Leave once your material quota is met.

---

## **Tactics (2)**  
- Target areas with your needed material bias.  
- Strip-mine ARC enemies for alloy, fabric, chemicals, rubber.  
- Avoid noise → stealth-based scavenge style.  
- Manage inventory weight; prioritize stackables and high-value items.

---

## **Operations (2)**  
- Enter with a short checklist: “fabric, chemicals, rubber, ammo.”  
- Loot drawers, cabinets, backpacks for utility mats.  
- Loot all Couriers / Probes you see.  
- Extract as soon as you can craft multiple upgrades back home.

---

# **Goal 3 — Workshop Expansion**
Blueprints • Weapons • Attachments

---

## **Policy (3)**  
Blueprints are the true long-term progression.  
They are rare, random, and the highest-value items in the early game.

---

## **Strategy (3)**  
- Maximize **unopened container interactions per minute**.  
- Focus on **dense loot interiors** instead of combat zones.  
- Maintain mobility → blueprint hunting is a numbers game.  
- Extract instantly when securing an unlearned blueprint.

---

## **Tactics (3)**  
- Use container-dense routing: apartments, utility interiors, office clusters.  
- Open **everything**—blueprints spawn universally.  
- Opportunistically loot Surveyors.  
- Safe-pocket blueprints instantly.

---

## **Operations (3)**  
- Sprint interior-to-interior, hitting every unopened container.  
- Ignore fights unless forced.  
- Blueprint found → re-check extract → bounce.  
- Sell duplicates to fund further runs.

---

# **Comparative Summary Table**

| Goal | Policy | Strategy | Tactics | Operations |
|------|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Character Progression** | Progress > loot | Quest-anchored raids | XP layering | Do quests → extract |
| **Material Farming** | Consistency > luck | Category zones | ARC strip-mining | Fill quota → extract |
| **Workshop Expansion** | Blueprints > everything | Max container opens | Container sweeps | BP found → extract |

# Looting Rules

General looting rules
- Focus on item color.
- Don't loot ammo, its cheap to craft. Collect it only when u are in need during raid and type you are currently using.
- Heavier items usually are less worth per weight, so its better to collect more lighter items.
- Heavier items usually give more resources when recycled than lighter.
- Recycling in base is 2x better than salvaging in raid
- Salvaging items for smaller parts is weight ineffective, but usefull when too much variety of items.

Early items focus

    arc cells (for shield chargers)
    any gun parts (preferably green)
    any mechanical components (preferably green)
    any electrical components (if you want to use heavier shields)
    arc alloy (workbenches upgrades)

White and green equipment require green materials.
Blue equipment often require blue materials.

# solo fine tips

     Tossing a couple snitch scanners and a lure directly on a raider's position will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of them.
    Use an explosive mine coupled with a trigger grenade on a fancy loot spot, toss in a flare as bait.
    Gas traps have big red lasers so they catch the eye. Use them to funnel approaching raiders down a certain path, you can use it as well to make friends by getting behind them and scaring them with a "DON'T SHOOT".
    Blocking doors throughout facilities to either funnel towards your ambush, or force a raider to breach through them making noise, giving their position away for ambush in either case.
    While we're on gas traps, use them to create a kind of laser maze through a tunnel, not necessarily to hunt people but it could be fun.
    And I ♥♥♥♥ you not this actually works: Use a showstopper or hornet cell to ground a rockie, climb on and you can throw lures to travel around the region.


Turning a building into a fortress can be done fast, and in parallel to gathering loot. Since the trap sounds are much quieter and less familiar to raider ears, you can often get away with this while someone else is in the building.

# skill spread strategies

Don't spread your Skill Points too thin. Decide what kind of Raider you are and commit:
• The Brawler (Conditioning): Invest in stamina and health. You want to run longer, dodge more, and shrug off damage. Bring heavy armor and weapons.

• The Ghost (Survival): Invest in quiet movement and resourcefulness. Make no noise when you loot. Use stealth and terrain to avoid fights and only take engagements on your terms.

• The Runner (Mobility): Invest in faster climbing, longer dodges, and quick traversal. You are never standing still, always repositioning and flanking.
