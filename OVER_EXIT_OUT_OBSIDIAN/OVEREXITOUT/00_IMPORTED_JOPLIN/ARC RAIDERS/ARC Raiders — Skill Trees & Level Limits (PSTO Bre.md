# **Overview**
The skill tree is the main permanent progression system in ARC Raiders.  
It controls your long-term raid power more than weapons do.

Because the game caps you at **level 75**, you cannot max every branch.  
You must build intentionally. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

# **Mental Model Framework**
## **“You are what you build up to be.”**

Applied through PSTO:
- **Policy:** The kind of raider you want to become  
- **Strategy:** Which tree(s) you commit to long-term  
- **Tactics:** How you distribute points under constraints  
- **Operations:** What you unlock first, next, and last

---

# **Skill Trees in ARC Raiders**
ARC Raiders has **three trees**: :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

1. **Mobility (yellow)**  
   - Stamina economy, traversal, dodging, vaulting, movement efficiency.

2. **Conditioning (green)**  
   - Durability, encumbrance mitigation, “clutch survival” perks, brawler endurance, and several efficiency perks tied to handling the physical stress of raiding.

3. **Survival (red)**  
   - Stealth/noise control, looting efficiency, field crafting, trap/disarm utility, and access to high-value locked loot mechanics.

---

# **Level Cap & Point Economy**
- **Level cap = 75** skill points total. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- High-tier perks require deep investment in a tree (e.g., 15-point thresholds; some late perks require much more). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Expeditions can award **up to ~5 bonus skill points** beyond level points, but they’re prestige-style and come with resets. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

**Meaning:**  
You can’t be “full master of all things.” The cap forces identity.

---

# **PSTO Breakdown**

## **Policy**
**“Decide who you are as a raider.”**

Under a 75-point cap, spreading everywhere makes you weak everywhere.  
Specialization or deliberate hybridization is mandatory. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## **Strategy**
**“Choose your commitment pattern across trees.”**

- **Deep Specialist:** One tree as your spine, others lightly touched.  
- **Hybrid:** Two trees meaningfully developed.  
- **Generalist:** Broad early utility, no mastery.

Current meta guidance still favors:
**Mobility foundation first → then Survival/Conditioning based on identity.** :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## **Tactics**
**“Take universal value early, then commit hard.”**

Tactical principles:
- Early points buy **always-useful fundamentals** (movement, basic sustain, fieldcraft/loot speed).  
- Next points push your **identity tree** to its unlock thresholds.  
- Cross-tree spending should be **surgical**, not habitual. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## **Operations**
**“How to spend points raid-to-raid.”**

- First ~15–20 points: **Mobility core** for stamina + traversal. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Next: buy only the universal tools you *personally* need.  
- Then: pour points into your identity tree until major unlocks are online.  
- Late game: patch holes via secondary tree.

---

# **Build Archetypes**
ARC Raiders supports three clean identity frames:

1. **Specialist (Deep Build)**  
   - One tree dominates. Strongest late game.

2. **Hybrid (Balanced Build)**  
   - Two trees with real depth. Best flexibility.

3. **Generalist (Wide Build)**  
   - Strong early utility, weak capstone access.

---

# **Skill Spread Strategies**

## **The Ghost (YOUR BUILD)**
**Identity:** Silent solo operator.  
**Primary Tree:** **Survival** (stealth + loot + crafting + disarm).  
**Secondary Tree:** **Mobility early/foundation** for stamina and movement.  
**Playstyle:** Avoid fights, control engagements, extract consistently. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

### **What defines Ghost**
- Noise-masking / quiet looting perks  
- Stealth movement efficiency  
- Trap / mine / tripwire safety  
- In-raid crafting to stay out longer  
- Loot speed so you’re exposed less

---

## **The Brawler**
**Identity:** Endurance bruiser.  
**Primary Tree:** Conditioning.  
**Secondary Tree:** Mobility.  
**Playstyle:** Take fights head-on, wear heavy gear, survive chaos. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## **The Runner**
**Identity:** Speed looter.  
**Primary Tree:** Mobility.  
**Secondary Tree:** Survival.  
**Playstyle:** Constant repositioning, hit-and-run looting, fast extractions. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

---

# **Universal Early Skill Priorities**
These are “good in every build” **without mislabeling a tree**:

1. **Mobility fundamentals**
   - Max stamina / stamina efficiency  
   - Dodge/vault/traversal perks  
2. **Survival fundamentals**
   - Field crafting  
   - Loot speed / noise masking  
3. **Conditioning fundamentals**
   - Encumbrance mitigation  
   - “clutch survival” stamina/health triggers  

These are universally valuable because they affect every raid phase. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

---

# **Summary**
ARC Raiders’ three-tree system plus a hard level cap means:

- **Policy:** pick an identity  
- **Strategy:** specialize or hybridize deliberately  
- **Tactics:** universal early → identity mid/late  
- **Operations:** first Mobility core, then Survival/Conditioning based on build  

**As a solo player, you are building The Ghost — stealth, control, and consistency.**
