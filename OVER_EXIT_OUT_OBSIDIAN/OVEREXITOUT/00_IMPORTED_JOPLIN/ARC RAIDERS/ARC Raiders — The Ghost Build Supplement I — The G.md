# Overview
Prestiging at **Level 20** transforms ARC Raiders’ progression structure.  
You are not building a long-term identity — you are building for a **compressed 20-level power curve** that resets repeatedly.

Your goal becomes:
- Fast unlocks  
- Fast stealth  
- Fast loot efficiency  
- No wasted points  
- Maximum blueprint extraction rate before every reset  

The Ghost remains the best solo archetype for this system because **stealth scales instantly**, while damage builds require time and depth you don’t have.

---

# Prestige Mental Model
## **“Build only what pays off NOW.”**

You operate under three truths:
1. Every point must produce immediate value.  
2. Long-term capstones are irrelevant — you won’t reach them.  
3. Extraction success and blueprint gain matter more than combat capability.  

Your build is essentially:
**The Ghost → Accelerated Edition.**

---

# PSTO With a Level-20 Ceiling

## Policy
**“I build for the first 20 levels only.”**  
This forces a strict identity:  
- Maximize stealth  
- Minimize fights  
- Run blueprint loops  
- Reset, repeat, compound efficiency

---

## Strategy
**“Mobility foundation → Early Survival → Zero Conditioning.”**  

Because Conditioning perks are generally late-game stabilizers, they **provide almost no ROI** in a 20-level window.

Your only viable strategy:
1. **Mobility first 8–10 points**  
2. **Survival next 10–12 points**  
3. Zero points anywhere else unless a perk directly increases stealth or looting speed.

The strategy is:  
**Reach Ghost functionality as fast as possible.**

---

## Tactics
**“Front-load movement and stealth unlocks, postpone everything else.”**

Tactical rules:
- Skip ANY perk that requires deep tree investment  
- Skip team perks, clutch perks, late-game perks  
- Buy only perks that reduce:  
  - noise  
  - exposure time  
  - stamina downtime  
  - looting time  

Every tactical decision favors:  
**lower risk → more raids → more blueprint opportunities → better NG+ advantage**

---

## Operations
**“Spend points in a strict order tied to real in-raid pain.”**

Operational build order:
1. Stamina + stamina recovery  
2. Traversal comfort (vaulting/dodging efficiency)  
3. Quiet looting  
4. Field crafting  
5. Basic stealth movement  

If a perk doesn’t pay dividends before Level 20 → **ignore it**.

---

# Level-20 Ghost Skill Allocation Plan

Below is the **optimal solo Ghost NG+ cycle plan**.

## **Levels 1–5: Immediate Mobility Foundation**
- Increase stamina pool  
- Reduce stamina drain  
- Improve dodge/slide movement efficiency  

**Why:** Your early game is defined by running more than fighting.

---

## **Levels 6–10: Movement → Looting Transition**
- Quiet-looting perk(s)  
- Faster search speed  
- First stealth movement upgrade  

**Why:** Looting safely is the only way to accelerate blueprint progression pre-reset.

---

## **Levels 11–15: Field Crafting + Stealth Mobility**
- Field crafting  
- Stealth running/walking upgrades  
- Noise dampening perks  

**Why:** Crafting keeps you alive; noise reduction keeps you invisible.

---

## **Levels 16–20: Ghost Identity Online**
- Trap disarming tool(s)  
- Stealth engagement buffer  
- More loot-speed bonuses  
- Optional Mobility QoL if Survival lacks accessible perks  

**Why:** These are your “final form” perks before the wipe.

You must end every Level-20 cycle as a **fully functional Ghost**, not a half-built hybrid.

---

# Survival Priorities Before Reset
You aim to have the following online before the reset:

1. **Silent movement**  
2. **Noise masking while looting**  
3. **Loot-speed increases**  
4. **Field crafting (bandages + shield crafting)**  
5. **Disarm capability**  
6. **Stamina and movement economy**  

If a perk does NOT meaningfully affect one of the six above → skip it.

---

# What Carries Into NG+ Cycles
Depending on the prestige system you use (internal rules / community / personal), typically:

### What carries forward:
- Player experience  
- Player map knowledge  
- Loot routes  
- Blueprint inventory  
- Vendor unlock strategy  
- Muscle memory for stealth play  
- Your plan scaling across resets  

### What resets:
- Skill tree  
- Level  
- Weapon marks (depends on your NG+ rules)  
- Loadouts  
- Progression quests (if self-imposed)

The Ghost build is optimal because **knowledge runs scale**, not stats.

---

# Prestige Loop Playstyle
1. Spawn → check extracts → pick the lowest-noise route.  
2. Loot interior clusters first (silent containers).  
3. Prioritize unopened containers (blueprint rolls).  
4. Safe-pocket ANY unlearned blueprint immediately.  
5. Avoid 100% of unnecessary fights — disengage on sound spike.  
6. Extract as soon as value quota is met.  
7. Reset at Level 20 → start fresh with better knowledge.  
8. Repeat loop until blueprint collection stabilizes.

The prestige loop is about **volume**, not conquest.

---

# Summary
Prestiging at Level 20 compresses the entire Ghost build into an **early-game hyper-optimized form**.  
Using PSTO:

- **Policy:** Only build for first 20 levels  
- **Strategy:** Mobility → Survival, skip Conditioning  
- **Tactics:** Instant-value perks only  
- **Operations:** Build stamina + stealth + loot-speed in that exact order  

This creates the fastest and safest NG+ Ghost cycle possible.

**Supplement II — “Post-20 NG+ Progression Plans”**  
will cover:
- Multi-cycle plans  
- Long-term tree optimization  
- Depth builds after multiple resets  
- When to introduce Conditioning  
- Meta-inflection points

Just say **“Make Supplement II.”**
