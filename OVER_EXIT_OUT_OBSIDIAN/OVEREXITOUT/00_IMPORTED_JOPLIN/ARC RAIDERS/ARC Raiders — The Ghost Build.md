# **Overview**
The Ghost is the most reliable solo archetype in ARC Raiders:
**unseen, unheard, and rarely forced into fair fights.**

It exploits the game’s main truth:
**sound attracts death.** :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

---

# **Ghost Mental Model**
## **“Silence is safety. Safety is profit.”**

You win by:
- lowering encounter rate  
- shortening exposure windows  
- controlling distance  
- extracting before chaos converges

---

# **PSTO Breakdown**

## **Policy**
**“I survive by not being detected.”**

As solo:
- every fight is asymmetric risk  
- stealth converts risk into choice  
- choice converts raids into consistency

Your identity: silent scavenger + precision looter + disengagement expert.

---

## **Strategy**
**“Mobility foundation → Deep Survival → Conditioning patch-ins.”**

Current solo-meta consistent across guides: :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
1. **Mobility early** to remove stamina bottlenecks.  
2. **Survival as your main tree** for stealth/loot/craft/disarm dominance.  
3. **Conditioning lightly** only when a perk solves a specific solo pain point
   (encumbrance, shield penalty, emergency stamina/health triggers).

You are aiming to hit the meaningful Survival thresholds early, not float around. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

---

## **Tactics**
**“Universal first, then stealth-stack hard.”**

Tactical priorities:
- Early Mobility perks that expand stamina economy and traversal.  
- Early Survival perks that:
  - reduce looting exposure  
  - mask or shrink your noise profile  
  - enable in-raid crafting  
- Delay Conditioning until Mobility+Survival are functional.

Solo-specific tactical advice in current guides:
- prioritize stealth + stamina recovery synergies  
- skip team-only perks entirely :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

---

## **Operations**
**“What you do with points in the exact order you feel it in game.”**

- **Levels 1–15:** Mobility core  
  - stamina size + stamina efficiency + traversal/dodge comfort  
- **Levels 16–35:** Survival core online  
  - field crafting  
  - quiet/efficient looting  
  - stealth movement perks  
- **Levels 36–55:** Deep Survival thresholds  
  - locked-loot access / high-tier stealth / disarm tools  
  - (note: some high-tier Survival perks have been nerfed recently — still valuable but not mandatory) :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
- **Levels 56–75:** Identity polish  
  - more Survival mastery  
  - Mobility quality-of-life  
  - Conditioning “solo insurance” if needed

Operational rule:
**if a perk doesn’t reduce detection risk or exposure time, it’s a luxury pick.**

# **Skill Tree Allocation Roadmap**
This is a roadmap, not a rigid list (perk names shift with patches). :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
![7b493a3214e1e878e2befdd1eb1610e3.png](../_resources/7b493a3214e1e878e2befdd1eb1610e3.png)
## **Early Game (1–20)**
- Mobility stamina economy
- Mobility traversal comfort
- Survival fieldcraft + loot-speed/quiet tools

## **Mid Game (20–45)**
- Push Survival investment to key thresholds
- Add stealth movement + disarm tools
- Add 1–3 Conditioning points only if encumbrance/shields are killing your stealth

## **Late Game (45–75)**
- Max your Survival identity perks
- Patch Mobility for route efficiency
- Conditioning only as “oh-shit” insurance

---

# **Core Strengths**
- Lowest PvP encounter rate
- Highest blueprint efficiency per hour
- Safest material farming style
- High extraction consistency
- Converts raids into repeatable profit loops :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

---

# **Weaknesses & Mitigations**
- **Lower combat ceiling**  
  → mitigate by refusing fair fights; ambush only.
- **Can be punished if cornered**  
  → mitigate with route awareness + early extracts.
- **Slow clears vs brawlers**  
  → your win condition is *profit consistency*, not map domination.

---

# **Ghost Raid Loop**
1. **Spawn → check extracts → choose quiet route.**
2. **Move low-noise between interior loot clusters.**
3. **Loot fast + quiet; open only unopened containers.**
4. **If sound spikes (ARC or players) → reposition immediately.**
5. **Safe-pocket blueprints/keys instantly.**
6. **Extract early once value quota is met.**
7. **Repeat. Consistency compounds.**

---

# **Summary**
The Ghost is the optimal solo build because it aligns with ARC Raiders’ real rule:
**exposure kills, silence pays.**

PSTO execution:
- **Policy:** avoid detection  
- **Strategy:** Mobility foundation → Deep Survival → light Conditioning  
- **Tactics:** universal early → stealth stacking  
- **Operations:** spend points only where they reduce risk or exposure

You’re not trying to win fights.  
You’re trying to win raids.
