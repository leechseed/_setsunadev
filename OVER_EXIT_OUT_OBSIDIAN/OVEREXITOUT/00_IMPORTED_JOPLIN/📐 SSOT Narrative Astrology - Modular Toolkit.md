# 📘 Authoritative Knowledgebase: Narrative Astrology (Omni-Reference SSOT)

> [!abstract] System Architecture Overview

## 1. Systemic Core Philosophy

**Narrative Astrology** is a deterministic, full-stack character rendering engine. It rejects "personality" as a series of random traits, instead defining it as a specific set of **Variables** and **Logic Gates** that respond to external **Systemic States**. In this framework:

- **The Chart:** The Source Code.
    
- **The Character:** The Compiled Entity.
    
- **The Story:** The Execution Environment.

## 2. The Dramatica-Astrology Interface (DAI)

The DAI is the primary input stage. Every Character is "spawned" from a structural payload to ensure thematic alignment.

|**System Port**|**Dramatica Input (API)**|**Astrological Variable (Return)**|**Narrative Function**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Identity**|Character Problem|**Primary Hard Aspect**|The core "bug" or friction in the code.|
|**Motivation**|Character Concern|**Sign Modality & Element**|The "Operating System" style (e.g., Water/Fixed).|
|**Cognition**|Unique Ability|**Mercury Configuration**|Data intake and tactical processing.|
|**Constraint**|Critical Flaw|**Saturn Placement**|The hard-coded wall/limit.|
|**Rendering**|Approach (Do-er/Be-er)|**Ascendant (Rising Sign)**|The visible UI/Aesthetic layer.|

---

## 3. Atomic Variables: Personal Stack (The Hardware)

The inner planets represent the Character's functional processing units.

- **SUN (`SUN_IDENTITY_AXIS`):** The central processor. Defines what the Character _believes_ they are. It generates the **Thematic Question**.
    
- **MOON (`MOON_INTERNAL_STATE`):** The instinctual default and subconscious memory bank. Under stress, the Character's logic collapses into this variable.
    
- **MERCURY (`MERCURY_CODE_INTERPRETATION`):** The logic gate. Controls speech, tactical navigation, code-breaking, and the ability to "Understand."
    
- **VENUS (`VENUS_VALUE_VECTOR`):** The priority sensor. Determines what resources or relationships the Character will attempt to "Acquire."
    
- **MARS (`MARS_ACTION_PROTOCOL`):** The execution command. Controls aggression, sexual energy, and physical movement (the "Doing" requirement).
    

---

## 4. Atomic Variables: Structural Stack (The Limit)

The outer planets represent the systemic environment and historical forces.

- **JUPITER (`JUPITER_REDUNDANCY`):** The system’s "permission" for growth. Where the Character finds temporary safety or resource spikes.
    
- **SATURN (`SATURN_ENTROPY_LIMITER`):** The boundary variable. Represents the rules, the antagonist, and the "Constraint" systemic state.
    
- **URANUS (`URANUS_BREACH_PROTOCOL`):** Sudden shifts in code. The "Awakening" variable that disrupts the loop.
    
- **NEPTUNE (`NEPTUNE_HAUNT_SIGNAL`):** The source of "glitches," illusions, and synthetic hauntings.
    
- **PLUTO (`PLUTO_TERMINATION_CODE`):** The ultimate reset. Intense power struggles leading to total Character exhaustion.
    

---

## 5. The Interface Layer (The Angles)

The Angles define how the Character is "rendered" and "recorded" in the world.

- **ASCENDANT (The Mask):** `CHARACTER_UI_SKIN`. The immediate aesthetic and first-response style.
    
- **MIDHEAVEN (The Output):** `CHARACTER_OUTPUT_LOG`. The public legacy and narrative achievement (The Story Goal).
    
- **DESCENDANT (The Shadow):** What the Character lacks and seeks in "The Other."
    
- **IC (The Root):** The private origin and hidden trauma foundation.

## 6. Network Topology: Unicursal Hexagram

Relationships are **Inter-Process Communications (IPC)** mapped onto the Unicursal Hexagram to track energy flow.

### Vertex Mapping:

1. **Top (Jupiter):** Social Status / Growth.
    
2. **Upper Left (Saturn):** Authority / Duty / Rules.
    
3. **Upper Right (Mars):** Conflict / Kinetic Violence.
    
4. **Lower Left (Mercury):** Logic / Negotiation / Code.
    
5. **Lower Right (Venus):** Intimacy / Value / Desire.
    
6. **Bottom (Moon):** Subconscious / Private Trauma.
    

---

## 7. Aspect Logic Gates (Computational Conflict)

Geometric relationships between variables function as Boolean logic gates.

- **CONJUNCTION (AND Gate):** Two variables fuse into a single command. (e.g., Sun conjunct Mars = "To exist is to act.")
    
- **SQUARE (NOT Gate):** Friction that forces a state change. Variable A prevents Variable B from executing, requiring a **Systemic Turning Point**.
    
- **OPPOSITION (XOR Gate):** A binary choice. The Character cannot execute both simultaneously (e.g., Logic vs. Desire).
    
- **TRINE (OR Gate):** A "Passive Talent." Data flows freely between points, often leading to **Systemic Stagnation** because there is no friction to force growth.
    

---

## 8. House Systems: Environmental Context

If Planets are the Hardware, **Houses** are the **Directories** where the action is saved.

- **Angular Houses (1, 4, 7, 10):** High-priority execution. Action here is visible, immediate, and shifts the plot.
    
- **Succedent Houses (2, 5, 8, 11):** Resource management. Action here is about maintenance, assets, and value.
    
- **Cadent Houses (3, 6, 9, 12):** Background processing. Action here is about communication, preparation, and hidden "Ghost-Code" (The Void).
    

---

## 9. Planetary Dignities: Code Efficiency

This determines how "well" a variable functions in a specific environment.

- **Essential Dignity (Domicile/Exaltation):** The Variable is running at 100% efficiency. The Character is "in their element."
    
- **Essential Debility (Detriment/Fall):** The Variable is "glitching." The Character struggles to execute that specific function correctly.
    
    - _Example:_ A **Mars in Cancer** (Fall) Character fights with emotional volatility rather than kinetic precision.
        

---

## 10. The Lifecycle Protocol (The 6 Movements)

The Character undergoes **Sequential Erosion** through six defined systemic states.

|**Movement**|**Systemic State**|**Dominant Planet**|**Variable Condition**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1. Delta Coast**|**Legibility**|**Mercury**|High Clarity. Character is acquired; code is clean.|
|**2. Year 1 School**|**Constraint**|**Saturn**|Integration. Code is bound by systemic rules.|
|**3. Year 2 School**|**Decay**|**Neptune**|Corruption. The internal Moon/Subconscious overrides the Sun.|
|**4. Bourne**|**Awakening**|**Uranus**|Awareness. The Character perceives the structural framework.|
|**5. Fight Club**|**Resistance**|**Mars**|Insurgency. Kinetic attempts to force a system reboot.|
|**6. The Pacific**|**Collapse**|**Pluto**|Exhaustion. Variables hit zero. Total Character Reset.|

## 11. Synastry Overlays: Network Mesh

This defines the **Collision Detection** between two or more Characters.

- **The Aspect Mesh:** When Character A's variable pings Character B's variable (e.g., A's Mars triggers B's Saturn Trauma).
    
- **The Composite Chart:** A third "Virtual Chart" created by the union of two Characters. This chart represents the **Relationship itself** as a separate entity with its own lifecycle.
    

---

## 12. Progressions: The Internal Clock

While **Transits** are external events, **Secondary Progressions** represent the "Aging" of the code.

- **Progressed Sun Change:** A fundamental shift in the Character's `IDENTITY_AXIS`. This usually occurs between major "Movements."
    
- **The Progressed Lunar Cycle:** A 28-month narrative arc that tracks the Character's emotional maturation or decay.
    

---

## 13. Transits: External Execution Commands

Transits are "pings" from the current "Psychological Sky" (The Plot) to the Character's static chart.

- **Saturn Return:** A mandatory system audit (occurs at major narrative milestones).
    
- **Mars Transit:** A temporary spike in kinetic conflict.
    
- **Outer Planet Transits:** These trigger the shift between the 6 Movements.
    

---

## 14. The Void Variable (12th House & Hauntology)

The **12th House** functions as the system’s **Garbage Collection (GC)** folder.

- **Variable:** `SYSTEM_RECURSION_LOG`.
    
- **Function:** Stores "deleted" memories and previous-movement data.
    
- **The Hauntology Effect:** When a Character's current `MERCURY` interacts with the `12th HOUSE` variable, they experience _Deja Vu_ or "Synthetic Haunting"—the realization that they are in a recursive loop.
    

---

## 15. The Reset Protocol: Systemic Wipe

At the conclusion of Movement 6, the system executes a **Terminal Reset**.

- **Data Persistence:** Which variables survive the wipe? (Usually stored in the 12th House/Void).
    
- **Character Re-Acquisition:** How the "Character" is re-introduced in Movement 1 of the next cycle.
    
- **The Ghost Signal:** The tiny percentage of "Entropy" that remains, allowing for the "Awakening" in the next iteration.
