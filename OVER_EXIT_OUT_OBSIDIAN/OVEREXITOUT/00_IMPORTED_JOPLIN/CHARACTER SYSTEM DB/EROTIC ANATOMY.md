## 1. **Overview**

This entry defines every option in the **Erotic Anatomy Attribute Library (X:1 System).**

Each attribute has:

* **Character:** What this means for the *body, vibe, and behavior* of the character.
* **Narrative:** How this attribute *functions in scenes, shots, and reader/viewer response*.

This plugs directly into your **PSTO erotic design**:

* **Policy:** What kind of goon response you are engineering.
* **Strategy:** Which attribute clusters you lock in to deliver that response.
* **Tactics:** The specific traits you pick from this list (x:1 each).
* **Operations:** How you deploy those traits in story, framing, and motion.

---

## 2. **How to Use This Document**

* For each category (Stimulus Mode, Silhouette, etc.), choose **ONE** attribute per character.
* Use **Character** lines when briefing artists, designers, or costume.
* Use **Narrative** lines when planning shots, beats, or prose emphasis.
* The definitions are written to be **stackable**: one look at the sheet tells you *what to draw* and *how to shoot/write it*.

---

## 3. **Core Stimulus Mode**

### **Visual magnetism**

* **Character:** Their looks alone pull attention; they’re a walking focal point even when still.
* **Narrative:** Shots and descriptions linger on their presence; any frame they’re in becomes about them.

### **Kinetic lust**

* **Character:** Their sexuality is in how they move—walking, stretching, turning, breathing.
* **Narrative:** Motion shots (walk cycles, transitions) become the primary goon bait rather than static poses.

### **Objectification architecture**

* **Character:** Their body feels built to be looked at, used, posed, or displayed like an object.
* **Narrative:** Framing treats them as an altar, trophy, or toy; scenes lean into angles that dehumanize on purpose.

### **Worship trigger**

* **Character:** They radiate “untouchable” or “divine” energy that demands reverence, not casual lust.
* **Narrative:** Scenes stage them like a shrine—slow reveals, low angles, ritualized lighting, devotional language.

### **Corruption/temptation drive**

* **Character:** Their whole appeal is “I shouldn’t, but I want to”—forbidden, dangerous, or morally off-limits.
* **Narrative:** They show up at moral crossroads; their presence escalates bad decisions and plot sin.

### **Domination attention-lock**

* **Character:** They feel in control; their sex appeal is power and threat, not softness.
* **Narrative:** Scenes with them tilt power dynamics; others react, flinch, or submit without realizing it.

### **Innocence dissonance**

* **Character:** They look harmless or pure while radiating something quietly ruinous underneath.
* **Narrative:** The camera or prose plays the gap between “she looks sweet” and “this is lethal goon bait.”

### **Breeding instinct ignition**

* **Character:** Their proportions and demeanor spike primal, reproductive impulses—hips, softness, warmth.
* **Narrative:** Framing leans into fertility coding—hips, lower belly, pelvis angles, “future” subtext.

## 4. **Body Silhouette**

### **Bubble-hips cutie**

* **Character:** Round, high hips and ass; overall compact and bouncy.
* **Narrative:** Chibi/“shortstack” energy; low-angle framing and walking animations focus on hip sway.

* **Character:** Legs dominate the proportions; torso feels smaller by comparison.
* **Narrative:** Full-body vertical framing, slow walks, and high heels become core visual language.

### **Compact brat doll**

* **Character:** Shorter, compressed proportions; everything reads “small but concentrated.”
* **Narrative:** Scenes use proximity and scale—other characters and environments make them look tiny and dangerous.

### **Natural powerlifter**

* **Character:** Thick, functional musculature; sturdy frame with visible strength.
* **Narrative:** Blocking emphasizes lifting, carrying, bracing; sex appeal comes from power and stability.

### **Soft sinful plush**

### **Legs**

* **Character:** Thighs and calves do the heavy lifting visually; stance and stride matter.

### **Lips/mouth**

* **Character:** Mouth, teeth, tongue, and lip movements dominate their allure.
* **Narrative:** Dialogue, smoking, drinking, licking, and breathing shots become micro-porn in themselves.

### **Eyes/eye-contact**
