🚀 Consultant's Recommendation: The "Heat" Map

If you want to know where the most interesting interactions will happen in your system, look at these specific variable collisions:

    The "Imposter" Collision:

        Compare SUN_EGO_STYLE (The Mask) vs. MOON_SURVIVAL_SCRIPT (The Panic).

        Example (Leo): They project "Theatrical Dominance" (Sun) but when triggered, they "Escalate performance to hide panic" (Moon). They are a fake king terrified of being seen naked.

    The "Self-Destruct" Collision:

        Compare VENUS_PLEASURE_METRICS (The Desire) vs. SATURN_LIMITATION_STYLE (The Debt).

        Example (Taurus): They crave "Deep sensory indulgence" (Venus) but are restricted by "Paranoia over financial solvency" (Saturn). They want to binge but are too scared to spend the money.

    The "Revolution" Collision:

        Compare MARS_ACTION_STYLE (The Attack) vs. URANUS_REBELLION_STYLE (The Break).

        Example (Aquarius): They attack via "Asymmetric disruption" (Mars) and rebel via "Chaotic ideological warfare" (Uranus). This is a character who doesn't fight people; they fight concepts.
