## Overview

This document defines the **Non-Negotiable Invariants** that enforce coherence across scale in *Bottle Rocket*.

This is not a competent crime film.  
It is not an ironic parody of heist movies.  
It is a structural account of **how aspiration outpaces capability, how loyalty replaces skill, and how failure becomes a form of identity**.

These invariants remain true across:
- earnest criminal planning  
- interpersonal loyalty tests  
- romantic idealization  
- bungled execution  
- the final anticlimax  

They are **constraints on meaning**, not tonal quirks.

---

## Project Scope

- **Medium**: Feature film  
- **Scale**: Line → Scene → Scheme → Friendship → Personal Stasis  
- **Domain Type**: Aspirational / relational / anti-competence  
- **Primary Risk**: Treating incompetence as satire instead of condition  

---

## Defined Non-Negotiable Invariants

### Invariant 1 — **Aspiration Greatly Exceeds Competence**

The dream is always larger than the plan.

---

### Invariant 2 — **Loyalty Substitutes for Skill**

Commitment fills the gap left by ability.

---

### Invariant 3 — **Criminality Is an Identity Fantasy**

Crime is less about profit than self-image.

---

### Invariant 4 — **Failure Is Absorbed, Not Transformed**

Loss does not provoke growth—it settles into routine.

---

## Invariant Validation Across Scale

### Invariant 1: Aspiration Greatly Exceeds Competence

- **Planning Dialogue**  
  Confidence is unmoored from logistics.

- **Operational Reality**  
  Execution collapses immediately under pressure.

- **Narrative Pattern**  
  Ambition is sincere but unsupported.

**Validation**: Wanting replaces knowing how.

---

### Invariant 2: Loyalty Substitutes for Skill

- **Friendship Dynamics**  
  Trust replaces expertise.

- **Decision Logic**  
  Choices prioritize inclusion over success.

- **Emotional Core**  
  Betrayal matters more than failure.

**Validation**: Belonging outranks outcome.

---

### Invariant 3: Criminality Is an Identity Fantasy

- **Self-Mythologizing**  
  Characters perform criminal roles without infrastructure.

- **Genre Echo**  
  Heist tropes exist only as borrowed posture.

- **Motivational Structure**  
  Crime offers narrative meaning, not livelihood.

**Validation**: Crime is cosplay.

---

### Invariant 4: Failure Is Absorbed, Not Transformed

- **Aftermath Behavior**  
  Loss produces resignation, not adaptation.

- **Emotional Resolution**  
  Characters return to baseline rather than transcend it.

- **End State**  
  Life resumes slightly altered but fundamentally unchanged.

**Validation**: Failure becomes background noise.

---

## Scale Enforcement Matrix

| Scale | Enforcement Question | Bottle Rocket Result |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Line | Is confidence matched by skill? | No |
| Scene | Does planning improve execution? | No |
| Scheme | Does loyalty increase success? | No |
| Friendship | Does failure fracture bonds? | No |
| Ending | Does loss provoke transformation? | No |

---

## Failure Tests (What Dies)

The following are structurally disallowed:

- Competence emerging through effort  
- Crime delivering empowerment or wealth  
- Failure reframed as clever subversion  
- Friendship dissolving under pressure  
- Endings that validate the fantasy  

If any appear, *Bottle Rocket* collapses into conventional indie success narrative.

---

## Operational Outcome

Because these invariants are enforced:

- Comedy feels gentle rather than sharp  
- Criminality reads as sad aspiration  
- Friendship remains central and unresolved  
- Failure feels normal rather than tragic  
- The ending feels suspended instead of resolved  

---

## Summary

*Bottle Rocket* maintains coherence by enforcing quiet constraints:

- aspiration dwarfs ability  
- loyalty replaces skill  
- crime is identity play  
- failure stabilizes instead of teaches  

The film works because **it treats not growing up as a sustainable, if fragile, state**.

**If wanting were enough, *Bottle Rocket* would be a success story.**
