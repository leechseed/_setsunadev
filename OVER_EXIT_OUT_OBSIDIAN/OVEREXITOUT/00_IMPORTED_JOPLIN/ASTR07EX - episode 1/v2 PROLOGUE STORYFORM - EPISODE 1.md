# PROLOGUE STORYFORM — EPISODE 1
**Working Title:** Slumside Core  
**Function:** Street-level origin that forges Vivian’s “ruthless competence,” installs the abandonment trauma (“why did they leave me?”), and hooks MAXWING.

## Story Dynamics
- **Driver:** Action → a skyfall event triggers the run; choices follow
- **Limit:** Timelock → narrow salvage window during debris storm
- **Outcome:** Success → the core is secured
- **Judgment:** Bad → personal cost; trust shattered
- **MC Resolve/Growth/Approach/Style:** Steadfast • Stop • Do-er • Linear

## Throughlines

### Overall Story (OS)
- **Domain:** Physics (Activity)
- **Concern:** Obtaining (a classified military AI core)
- **Issue:** Self-Interest vs. Morality
- **Problem / Solution:** **Avoid** → **Pursuit**
- **Symptom / Response:** **Control** ↔ **Uncontrolled**
- **Goal:** Secure and deliver the AI core from the re-entry field
- **Consequence:** Becoming (remain a dock-rat; become marked by gangs/system)
- **Requirements:** Plot skyfall; bribe a berth; outfit a tug; mask transponders
- **Forewarnings:** Window narrows; rival comms spike; port lockdown rumors spread
- **Catalyst / Inhibitor:** Self-Interest / Morality
- **Benchmark:** Doing (prep runs, launch, mid-run pivots)

### Main Character (MC) — *Vivian (pre-teen)*
- **Domain:** Universe (Situation) — paperless, too young, off-the-books
- **Concern:** Present (ration caps, exposure, no legal berth)
- **Issue:** Openness vs. Prejudice
- **Problem / Solution:** **Uncontrolled** → **Control**
- **Unique Ability:** Approach (decisive micro-gambits under pressure)
- **Critical Flaw:** Naïve loyalty (trusts crew beyond safety)

### Impact Character (IC) — *The Fisherman (handler/mentor)*
- **Domain:** Mind (Fixed Attitude) — patient, stoic, “count the tides”
- **Concern:** Conscious (cool read of risks and people)
- **Issue:** Logic vs. Feeling
- **Problem / Solution:** **Reconsider** → **Consider**
- **IC Function:** Challenges her blind loyalty with disciplined, unsentimental judgment

### Relationship (RS) — *Vivian ↔ The Fisherman*
- **Domain:** Psychology (Manipulation)
- **Concern:** Becoming (ward → self-reliant operator)
- **Issue:** Commitment vs. Responsibility
- **Problem / Solution:** **Hinder** → **Help**
- **Benchmark:** Learning (signals, tells, port “tide tables” of corruption)

## Plot Progressions (Signposts → brief beats)

### OS (Physics: Learning → Doing → Understanding → Obtaining)
1. **Learning:** Rumor of a military core in the night’s skyfall; track trajectories; spy Mudlark chatter; assemble a shoestring crew.  
2. **Doing:** Launch in the debris storm; ship-to-ship harassment; micro-thrust dodges; tether work.  
3. **Understanding:** Vivian realizes her crew intends to cut her out; reads the betrayal; recalculates solo route.  
4. **Obtaining:** Alone, she snags the payload, rides the storm, and docks through a back-channel handoff.

### MC (Universe: Past → Progress → Present → Future)
1. **Past:** Glimpses of dock-side upbringing; favors owed; the Fisherman’s first rescue.  
2. **Progress:** Skills and hustle improve; small wins breed crew envy.  
3. **Present:** Today’s cap: no papers, no berth, no bribe—still she launches.  
4. **Future:** Post-run, she chooses self-reliance over belonging—whatever it costs.

### IC (Mind: Memory → Conscious → Preconscious → Subconscious)
1. **Memory:** Harbor lore; stories of kids who trusted the wrong hands.  
2. **Conscious:** Clear-eyed counsel: *count your air, count your friends—twice.*  
3. **Preconscious:** His reflex is restraint: don’t chase ego fights in a storm.  
4. **Subconscious:** The gut lesson lands—survival before sentiment.

### RS (Psychology: Conceiving → Being → Becoming → Conceptualizing)
1. **Conceiving:** He proposes a quiet, legal-adjacent path; she balks.  
2. **Being:** Mentor/ward roles strain as she insists on riding with the crew.  
3. **Becoming:** Betrayed, she adopts his colder creed mid-run to finish alone.  
4. **Conceptualizing:** Together they outline a new operating model: analog, quiet, self-reliant.

## Bridge to Ep. 2 / Core Series
- **Abandonment image:** Vivian sees her former friends at port—laughing, unbothered—cementing the “why?” scar.  
- **Hook:** MAXWING scouts flag the handoff; the Fisherman steps back, having “placed” her.  
- **Carry-forward pressure:** Reputation as a ruthless closer draws rivals and recruiters; morality/self-interest tension persists into planning arcs.
