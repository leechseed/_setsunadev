# ☕ Coffee Break Pilot Plan — Ep.1 “Slumside Core”
**Goal:** Build a tight pilot spine *plus* reflective/montage beats (FLCL/Life Is Strange vibe) that deepen world + character without lore dumps.

---

## 0) Anchor the Spine (30s)
**Premise (short):** A paperless scrap kid survives betrayal and a debris storm to steal a classified AI core—hardening into ruthless competence and catching MAXWING’s eye.

---

## 1) Where to Place the Reflective Beats (3 fixed slots + 1 optional)
- **RB-1 Early Breather (after Inciting Incident):** world tone & Vivian’s micro-rituals before the run.
- **RB-2 Choice Pause (pre-Midpoint):** “go/no-go” reflection just before she realizes the crew is cutting her out.
- **RB-3 Survival Montage (late Act 2 / pre-Climax):** solo recalculation + tactile problem-solving under the storm.
- **RB-4 Optional Epilogue Stinger:** aftermath images as MAXWING clockwork notices her.

> Guideline: 20–45 sec each; 6–12 shots; minimal/no dialogue; aim for **one new facet** (place, rule, emotion) per beat.

---

## 2) Montage/Reflection Types (pick 1 per slot)
- **Object Lyric:** Tight inserts of worn objects that tell history (dock badge splinters, patched glove, cracked mask).
- **Street Chorus:** Wide-to-close vignettes of port life (hustles, scams, repairs, kids chalking crash grids).
- **Ritual Micro-Choreo:** Hands doing analog prep (waxing seals, winding timers, paper keys into oilskin).
- **Choice Pause Tilt:** Time slows; ambient drops; 3–5 images of the cost if she says “yes.”
- **Failure Catalog:** Snapshots of near-misses/old scars; punch-in on breath and eyes.
- **Ecology Micro-Doc:** Micro-fauna in oily water, mangled nets, slag-rain; port tannoy poetry over it.
- **Memory Glitch Overlay:** Quick, nonliteral flashes (Fisherman’s silhouette, Mudlark emblem, broken tether).
- **Diegetic Scrapbook:** Polaroids/phone scraps/pier graffiti; in-world captions scratched in paint.

---

## 3) Coffee-Break Exercises (5–6 min each)
Do these as mini-sprints—no overthinking.

1) **Image Bank 15** (5 min)  
   List 15 concrete images that scream *Slumside*. Prioritize **touch/sound** (e.g., “suit zipper teeth,” “tannoy hiss,” “wet magnesium sparks”).

2) **Object Lyric Deck** (6 min)  
   Write 8 insert shots; each = **[object + action + subtext]**.  
   *Ex:* “Cracked HUD film — peeled and re-taped — ‘keep going anyway.’”

3) **Ritual Recipe** (5 min)  
   6-step silent sequence for Vivian’s pre-run ritual. No faces until step 6.

4) **Street Chorus Pairs** (6 min)  
   5 two-shot pairs that **contrast** (haves vs have-nots; official vs DIY). End each pair with a **match cut** idea.

5) **Choice Pause Board** (5 min)  
   6 frames: 3 frames = ‘yes’ cost; 3 frames = ‘no’ cost. Only **externalized** visuals.

6) **Sound Bed List** (5 min)  
   12 diegetic sounds. Mark 3 for **J-cuts** into scenes (e.g., “Foghorn → cut to silent close-up”).

7) **Survival Problem-Solve** (6 min)  
   Write 5 tactile fixes Vivian performs solo (tape, wire, wedge, breathe). Each fix must **change odds** visibly.

8) **Epilogue Stinger Cards** (5 min)  
   4 images that imply MAXWING interest without dialogue (clipboard stamp, laser rangefinder dot, fisherman's slight nod, unseen camera blink).

---

## 4) Pilot Beat Map (w/ Reflective Beats slotted)
- **Cold Open (1–2 min):** Micro-disaster insert flurry → Vivian pops into frame (no VO).  
- **Inciting Incident:** Ping of the AI core in incoming debris.  
- **RB-1 Early Breather:** *Ritual Micro-Choreo* + *Street Chorus* (port rules shown, not told).  
- **Break into Run:** She barges onto the crew; Fisherman watches.  
- **Progress / Pressure:** Mudlark shadowing; port scanners twitch.  
- **RB-2 Choice Pause:** *Choice Pause Tilt* as she senses they’ll cut her out.  
- **Midpoint Betrayal:** Tether maneuver; crew bails; storm intensifies.  
- **RB-3 Survival Montage:** *Survival Problem-Solve* + *Object Lyric* under alarms; zero speeches.  
- **Climax:** She rides the storm, docks dirty, makes analog handoff.  
- **Aftermath:** She spots the crew laughing, unbothered.  
- **RB-4 Stinger (optional):** MAXWING tells—gloved stamp, Fisherman’s non-reaction, distant lens flare → cut.

---

## 5) Camera & Edit Grammar (quick rules)
- **Cuts:** Smash-in on touch; **match cuts** (circle → port hatch), **J-cuts** with tannoy/radio.  
- **Lenses:** Close macro for ritual; 35–50mm for human scale; 85–100mm compression for isolation.  
- **Motion:** FLCL-style whip/eyecatch only on transitions; LIS-style linger for Choice Pauses.  
- **On-screen Text:** In-world stencils/stamps (no UI HUDs).  
- **Color/Light:** Sodium vapor amber + arc-weld blues; storm = desat + harsh speculars.

---

## 6) Music/Sound Design (diegetic first)
- **Diegetic anchors:** Port radio (fisherman’s low-fi station), hull groans, cable twang, siren doppler.  
- **Non-diegetic rules:** Reserve score for RB-2/3; keep motifs **percussive + breath + mechanical**.  
- **Silence:** Use silence as a *decision spotlight* (freeze the port; hold on her eyes).

---

## 7) World Depth Without Lore Dumps
- **Every reflection beat adds one rule of place.**  
  Examples to seed:
  - “Paper keys beat air-gapped laptops here.”  
  - “Port favors bribes wrapped in fish paper.”  
  - “Tannoy lies; the tide table doesn’t.”  
  - “Mudlarks mark territory with green wire ties.”

---

## 8) Throughline Hooks (quiet alignment)
- **OS:** Show the *work* (tethers, burns, bribes).  
- **MC:** Show constraint (paperless, ration caps) and the **attitude shift**.  
- **IC (Fisherman):** 1–2 silent corrections (a head shake; a hand held; a line cut).  
- **RS:** Mentor/ward reframed into “operators” by RB-3.

---

## 9) Coffee-Break Scene Cards (printable template)
**Card Title:** RB-[1–4] — [Type]  
**Purpose (1 line):** [What truth/world rule does this reveal?]  
**Image List (6–12):** [line-break list]  
**Sound Bed (3):** [diegetic sources]  
**Transition In/Out:** [match cut / J-cut / smash]  
**No Dialogue Rule:** [y/n; if y, why]  
**Throughline Tie:** [OS/MC/IC/RS]  
**Beat Placement:** [page/time]

---

## 10) Minimal Writing Plan (six sprints)
- Sprint 1: Image Bank 15 + Sound Bed List  
- Sprint 2: RB-1 card  
- Sprint 3: RB-2 card  
- Sprint 4: RB-3 card  
- Sprint 5: RB-4 card (optional)  
- Sprint 6: Insert these into the pilot outline; write the adjacent 3–5 line **connector** beats only.

> Result: a pilot that *moves* like a thriller but breathes like a memory—no lore dumps, maximum world texture.
