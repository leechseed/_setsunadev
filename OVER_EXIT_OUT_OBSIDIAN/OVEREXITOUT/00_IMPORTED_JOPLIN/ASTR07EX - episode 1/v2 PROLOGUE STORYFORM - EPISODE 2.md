# PROLOGUE STORYFORM — EPISODE 2
**Working Title:** The Ancient Wallet Job  
**Function:** Shift from street-level survival to *manipulation & planning*; install MODS as the standing IC force; light the DHR countdown that Ep. 3 must execute against.

## Story Dynamics
- **Driver:** Action → a chain-analysis sweep and MODS audit hit first; choices follow
- **Limit:** Timelock → a DHR “heartbeat” ping initializes a silent countdown window
- **Outcome:** Success → the heist architecture is conceived and a lead secured
- **Judgment:** Bad → personal cost deepens; trust corrodes; lines blur
- **MC Resolve/Growth/Approach/Style:** Steadfast • Stop • Do-er • Linear

## Throughlines

### Overall Story (OS)
- **Domain:** Psychology (Manipulation)
- **Concern:** Conceptualizing (engineering the wallet-recovery schema)
- **Issue:** State of Being vs. Sense of Self
- **Problem / Solution:** **Avoid** → **Pursuit**
- **Symptom / Response:** **Support** ↔ **Oppose**
- **Goal:** Design a viable plan to recover an *ancient* bitcoin wallet (custody unknown)
- **Consequence:** Being co-opted into MODS compliance (becoming part of the protocol)
- **Requirements:** Cold-read the custody chain; map air-gapped routes; recruit a clean “front”; procure **analog failsafes** (Faraday crates, mu-metal sleeves, wind-up timelocks, burner paper keys); seed dead-drops; secure a non-digital rendezvous
- **Forewarnings:** Prototype plans collapse under surveillance; “dust” transactions tag their scouts; port scanners cross-index aliases; quiet arrests nearby
- **Catalyst / Inhibitor:** Responsibility / Commitment
- **Benchmark:** Becoming (crew “becomes” criminals, martyrs… or ghosts)

### Main Character (MC) — *Vivian*
- **Domain:** Universe (Situation) — semi-legit now, but paperless past lingers; resources scarce
- **Concern:** Present (exposure today; thin margins; watchlists)
- **Issue:** Openness vs. Prejudice
- **Problem / Solution:** **Uncontrolled** → **Control**
- **Unique Ability:** Approach (decisive, analog-first gambits that reduce digital surface)
- **Critical Flaw:** Attitude (contempt for gatekeepers poisons alliances)

### Impact Character (IC) — *MODS* (the System)
- **Domain:** Mind (Fixed Attitude) — encoded refusal to change; “truth = protocol”
- **Concern:** Memory (immutable logs; audit trails; retroactive guilt)
- **Issue:** Closure vs. Denial
- **Problem / Solution:** **Non-Accurate** → **Accurate**  
  *(their brittle exactness exposes itself when reality won’t fit the ledger)*
- **IC Function:** Reframe definitions; nullify premises; force submission to record

### Relationship (RS) — *Vivian ↔ MODS*
- **Domain:** Physics (Activity)
- **Concern:** Obtaining (access, keys, clearances, physical custody)
- **Issue:** Morality vs. Self-Interest
- **Problem / Solution:** **Hinder** → **Help**
- **Benchmark:** Doing (workarounds, analog rituals, dirty ops)

## Plot Progressions (Signposts → brief beats)

### OS (Psychology / Conceiving → Being → Becoming → Conceptualizing)
1. **Conceiving:** A rumor surfaces: a “dead” wallet address signs a heartbeat—DHR pings; Vivian senses legacy money and leverage.  
2. **Being:** They don roles—broker, archivist, janitor—run social-engineering passes; MODS policy nodes keep “politely” denying premises.  
3. **Becoming:** Masks stick; a crew member compromises a value; Vivian trims the roster to reduce attack surface.  
4. **Conceptualizing:** Under pressure, an analog-heavy heist design “clicks”: shard retrieval via off-grid relays, paper key splits, Faraday handoff.

### MC (Universe / Past → Progress → Present → Future)
1. **Past:** She weaponizes the E1 abandonment—no more naïve permissions; only results.  
2. **Progress:** Scavenged intel improves… until a surveillance brushback freezes their digital leads.  
3. **Present:** Pinpoint the live window before DHR recycles; pick the city-to-coast corridor with lowest scanner density.  
4. **Future:** She accepts the cost: burning covers and maybe people—to move this plan into action.

### IC (Mind / Memory → Conscious → Preconscious → Subconscious)
1. **Memory:** MODS cites immutable logs to deny provenance and travel; “records disagree.”  
2. **Conscious:** Their “concerns” are policy flags masquerading as ethics; they stall with procedure.  
3. **Preconscious:** Auto-blocks fire mid-call; silent throttling; keyphrases trigger denies without human review.  
4. **Subconscious:** Bedrock motive revealed: *stasis* (no change, no exception, no precedent).

### RS (Physics / Learning → Understanding → Doing → Obtaining)
1. **Learning:** Vivian maps how to “talk around” the protocol—never assert, only imply.  
2. **Understanding:** She realizes **silence** is MODS’ weapon; absence of reply is the ruling.  
3. **Doing:** She builds an **analog ritual**: pre-agreed knocks, paper seals, wind-up clocks, windowed drop sites.  
4. **Obtaining:** First shard of access is secured in meatspace—proof the ritual can beat the record.

## Bridge to Ep. 3
- **Flip to OS: Physics (Activity):** the plan *must* be executed now—live runs, moving parts.  
- **Standing IC:** MODS escalate from audits to interdiction; they’re the wall Ep. 3 slams against.  
- **Countdown Lit:** The DHR clock is running; with one shard in hand and the route charted, Ep. 3 opens mid-motion under **Understanding/Conditioning** pressure.
