# EDIT THE SMALL STUFF — 10-Minute Micro-Edits

Use a focused ten-minute pass to clean clutter and tighten readability.

---

### **Micro-Edit Options**
1. **Rename minor characters by profession.**  
   *(e.g., “Receptionist” → “Front Desk Clerk,” “Orderly,” “Dock Foreman”)*

2. **Cut entrances and exits.**  
   *(Skip “walks in / leaves”; jump to action.)*

3. **Remove minor time-thieves** (receptionists, waiters, nurses, etc.) that don’t alter plot.  

4. **Delete segue crutches** like “that reminds me” / “speaking of,” **and** the dialogue that follows if it’s filler.  

5. **Trim dialogue hedges:** Cut “Yeah,” “So,” “Well” unless essential to voice or timing.  

6. **Reduce name overuse** for emphasis in dialogue.  
   *(“Listen, Jack—Jack…” → “Listen…”)*
   
7. **Cut verbal reactions to bad news** and let **visuals** carry impact.  

8. **Lose non-diegetic music cues** unless sourced on-screen.

|                  |           |                              |                    |                             |

|                  |           |                              |                    |                             |

### **Checklist**
- [ ] No filler entrances/exits remain.  
- [ ] Minor characters don’t **steal time** without plot value.  
- [ ] Segue crutches and hedge words are trimmed.  
- [ ] Dialogue avoids **name overuse**.  
- [ ] Emotional hits rely on **image/performance**, not verbal repeats.  
- [ ] Music cues are **diegetic only** (unless story-critical).
