# Show It

Take your speed draft to the next level by replacing talky scenes with active moments.

### **Steps**

**Step 1**  
Look at your scene list and note where you’ve described a scene with words like *convinces, talks to, asks about.* Replace them with verbs that force your character into an **action** — not a conversation.  

**Step 2**  
Focusing on your new activity, rewrite the scene. For example: if a character overheard the truth before, in your developed scene she may **discover it**.
