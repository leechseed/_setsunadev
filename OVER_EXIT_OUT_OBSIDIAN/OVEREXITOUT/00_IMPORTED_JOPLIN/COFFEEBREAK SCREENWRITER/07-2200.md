# PARAGRAPH YOUR SCENE DIRECTION — Formatting Exercise

Break long passages of scene direction into clear, readable paragraphs for pacing and visual flow.

---

### **Steps**
1. **New Shot = New Paragraph**  
   - Create a break whenever the visual angle or framing changes.  

2. **New Point of View = New Paragraph**  
   - Start a fresh paragraph when the perspective shifts to a different character or subject.  

3. **Allow One-Line Paragraphs**  
   - Use single-line breaks for punchy actions or dramatic emphasis.  

4. **Fight or Chase Choreography**  
   - Each new piece of movement, strike, or dodge gets its **own paragraph**.

---

### **Scene Direction Checklist**
- [ ] Did I create new paragraphs when the shot changed?  
- [ ] Did I create new paragraphs when POV shifted?  
- [ ] Did I allow for short, one-line impact paragraphs?  
- [ ] Did I break down fight/chase choreography into separate beats?

### **Before → After Example**
**Before (Unbroken Block):**  
> The two men circle. One throws a punch, the other ducks, they crash into a table. The crowd roars as one grabs a bottle, smashes it, and charges forward.

**After (Paragraph-Structured):**  
> The two men circle.  
>   
> One throws a punch. The other ducks.  
>   
> They crash into a table. The crowd roars.  
>   
> One grabs a bottle, smashes it, and charges forward.
