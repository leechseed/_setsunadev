# DIAL DOWN YOUR MAIN CHARACTER — Everyman Calibration

Identify scenes where the MC should read more like an “everyman.” Apply one or more of the strategies below.

---

### **Strategies**
1. **Replace Speeches with Wisdom**
   - Cut lectures/monologues; substitute a concise, **wise comment** or understated beat.

2. **Raise External Craziness**
   - Amplify the **extreme event** or **eccentric supporting characters** around the MC.

3. **Show Calm, Clear Reaction**
   - Keep the MC’s response **measured**: amused, bemused, or quietly befuddled.

4. **Limit Actions to One Strong Choice**
   - Remove fidgety “business.” Give the MC **one decisive action** in the scene.

---

### **Everyman Calibration Checklist**
- [ ] Speechifying replaced with a brief, pointed line.  
- [ ] Surrounding chaos/oddity heightened to contrast MC’s normalcy.  
- [ ] MC reaction is readable, restrained, and character-true.  
- [ ] Exactly **one** strong choice anchors the scene.
