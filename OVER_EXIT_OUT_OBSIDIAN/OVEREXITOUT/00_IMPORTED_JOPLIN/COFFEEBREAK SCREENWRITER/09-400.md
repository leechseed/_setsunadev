### **Entry Cuts (Enter Late)**
1. Open on people already **in conversation** — cut introductions.  
2. Open on a character already **on the phone** — cut the ring and “hello?”.  
3. Open **mid-party**.  
4. Open **mid-dinner**.  
5. Open **mid-love scene**.

### **Exit Cuts (Leave Early)**
6. Cut after the **first moment of seduction**.

### **Checklist**
- [ ] Scenes skip **introductions and filler**.  
- [ ] Scenes exit on a **sharp, resonant image/reaction**.  
- [ ] Cuts preserve **clarity** while heightening **pacing**.  
- [ ] Emotional moments **land harder** without overstay.
