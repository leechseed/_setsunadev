# CREATE SECONDARY SCENE HEADINGS — Flow Within Sequences

Use **secondary scene headings** (sub-slugs) to keep big sequences fluid (chases, parties, room-to-room) without hard scene breaks.

---

### **When to Use**
- **Chase sequences** spanning micro-locations
- **Parties / events** with shifting pockets of action
- **Room-to-room** movement inside a single set
- **Montage-like** runs that should read as one continuous beat

---

### **Formatting Rules**
- Keep the **primary slug**; add **ALL-CAPS sub-slugs** for shifts.
- Sub-slugs are minimal and left-aligned: `KITCHEN`, `HALLWAY`, `ON STAGE`, `BACK ALLEY`.
- Prefer clean sub-slugs over `CONTINUOUS / MOMENTS LATER` unless necessary.
- One **action paragraph** per beat; use blank lines to pace movement.

---

### **Sub-Slug Syntax**
```

INT. MANSION — NIGHT

FOYER
Action beat.

GRAND STAIRCASE
Next beat.

UPSTAIRS HALL
Reversal / complication.

```
```

EXT. BLOCK — NIGHT

ALLEY
Action beat.

FIRE ESCAPE
Escalation.

ROOFTOP
Button into next scene.

```

---

### **Conversion Checklist**
- [ ] Replace stop-start hard slugs with sub-slugs where flow matters
- [ ] Micro-locations are clear in **few words**
- [ ] Action pacing uses **short paragraphs / one beat per line**
- [ ] Transitions imply motion **without camera jargon**
- [ ] POV remains **trackable and consistent**

---

### **Template — Secondary Headings in a Single Flow**
```

INT./EXT. PRIMARY LOCATION — TIME

SECONDARY HEADING
Who does what. Purpose.

SECONDARY HEADING
Escalation or shift.

SECONDARY HEADING
Complication / reversal.

SECONDARY HEADING
Button / handoff.

```

### **Sequence Planning Grid**
| Seq # | Master Scene Slug | Secondary Headings (Order) | Purpose of Each Beat (1–2 words) | POV Tracked? (Y/N) | Notes / Rewrites |
|:----:|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 1    |                    |                            |                                  |                    |                  |
| 2    |                    |                            |                                  |                    |                  |
| 3    |                    |                            |                                  |                    |                  |
```
