# EDIT EXPOSITION — Dialogue Rewrite Exercise

Refine exposition by ensuring dialogue comes from **character knowledge** rather than “on the nose” explanation. Remove key words to force creativity and subtext.

---

### **Worksheet Template**
- **Scene is about**:  
  > (Central event or situation)

- **Audience has to learn**:  
  > (Critical piece of information the scene must deliver)

- **Characters already know**:  
  > (Shared knowledge between characters — prevents clunky exposition)

- **Forbidden words**:  
  > (Terms, names, or phrases not allowed in dialogue to avoid bluntness)

---

### **Rewrite Guidelines**
1. Start with what characters **assume is understood**.  
2. Use **indirect references**, implication, or metaphor.  
3. Let **conflict, humor, or emotion** carry the exposition.  
4. Ensure the audience still receives the **necessary information**.
