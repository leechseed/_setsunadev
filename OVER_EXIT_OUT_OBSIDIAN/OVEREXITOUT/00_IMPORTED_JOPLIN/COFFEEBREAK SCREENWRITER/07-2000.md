# FIND THE PERFECT LINE #1 — Overwrite Extraction

Edit overwritten passages in two steps to reveal the core line that carries the beat.

---

### **Steps**
1. **Locate Overwritten Passages**  
   - Identify sections where language is redundant, flowery, or doubles the same idea.
2. **Circle the Line That Makes the Point**  
   - Mark the single sentence that expresses the **essential beat**.

---

### **Guidelines for Spotting the Line**
- **Clarity over Ornament** — If you trimmed everything else, which line would you keep?  
- **Actionable Meaning** — Which line moves story, reveals character, or turns the beat?  
- **Memorability** — Which line you’d quote in a pitch or scene summary?
