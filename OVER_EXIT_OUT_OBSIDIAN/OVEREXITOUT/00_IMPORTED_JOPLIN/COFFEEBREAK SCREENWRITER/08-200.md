# EDITING OVER-CHOREOGRAPHED SCENE DIRECTION

Simplify direction by trimming fussiness and streamlining activity.

---

### **Steps**
1. **Remove Extra Lines**  
   - Cut redundant or overly detailed actions that slow pacing.  
   - Example: Replace three lines of “he turns, steps, reaches” with one line: *He crosses to the door.*  

2. **Synopsize Activities**  
   - Summarize step-by-step actions into concise beats.  
   - Example: Replace “She opens the fridge, takes out eggs, butter, and milk, sets them on the counter, and cracks the eggs” with: *She preps breakfast ingredients.*  

---

### **Guidelines**
- Focus on **story beats**, not micro-movements.  
- Use **strong verbs** over choreography (e.g., *charges*, *collapses*, *dives*).  
- Keep sentences **lean and visual**.  
- Let performance, not script, dictate small gestures.

### **Over-Choreography Edit Log**
| Scene ID / Title | Original Passage | Problem (Too Fussy / Redundant / Step-by-Step) | Concise Rewrite | Effect on Flow |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
|                  |                  |                                               |                 |                |
|                  |                  |                                               |                 |                |
|                  |                  |                                               |                 |                |

### **Before → After Snip**
**Before (Over-Choreographed):**  
> He opens the car door, slides in, buckles the seatbelt, turns the key, checks the mirror, and grips the wheel.  

**After (Concise):**  
> He starts the car.
