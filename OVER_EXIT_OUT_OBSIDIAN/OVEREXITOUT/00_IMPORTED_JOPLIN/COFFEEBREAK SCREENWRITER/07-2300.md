# REPLACE CAMERA DIRECTION — Action-First Rewriting

---

### **Steps**
1. **Replace camera direction by making the subject active.**  
2. **Do the same with any description starting with “we.”**  
3. **Repeat until finished.**

---

### **Conversion Rules**
- **Turn lenses into actions:** Replace “CAMERA PUSHES IN ON X” → “X steps forward, filling the frame.”  
- **Remove “we” phrasing:** Replace “We see the door open” → “The door creaks open.”  
- **Prefer agents over angles:** Name the **doer** and the **deed** (subject → strong verb).  
- **Keep beats atomic:** One action per sentence when clarity matters.  
- **Preserve intent, drop syntax:** Keep suspense/reveal/scale but express through behavior and result.  

---

### **Rewrite Template**
- **Original Line (with camera/‘we’ language):**  
  >
- **Active Subject + Strong Verb (no camera terms):**  
  >
- **Resulting Beat / Effect on Story:**  
  >

---

### **Before → After Snips**
**Before (Camera/“We”):**  
>  

**After (Action-First):**  
>  

---

### **Common Transforms (Quick Substitutions)**
- **We see / We hear** → **X appears / A sound erupts**  
- **Camera pans/tilts/tracks to** → **X crosses / turns / approaches / reveals**  
- **Angle on / Close on** → **X’s eyes narrow / the blade gleams**  
- **Cut to** → (omit; rely on the next action line)
