# BEAT STEREOTYPE BY PLAYING AGAINST IT — Subversion Worksheet

Challenge expectations by **playing against stereotype**. Create a “script reality” that directly undermines the audience’s assumptions.

---

### **Instructions**
1. **List the stereotype** typically applied to the character.  
2. **Define a script reality** that subverts this stereotype.  
3. **Rewrite the scene** to dramatize the reversal.

---

### **Worksheet Template**
- **Character**:  
  > (Main character, supporting, or other role)

- **Stereotype (Judgment by Others)**:  
  > 

- **Script Reality (Subversion / Truth)**:  
  > 

- **Scene Rewrite (Demonstration of Subversion)**:  
  >

|           |            |                               |                              |
|           |            |                               |                              |
|           |            |                               |                              |
|           |            |                               |                              |
