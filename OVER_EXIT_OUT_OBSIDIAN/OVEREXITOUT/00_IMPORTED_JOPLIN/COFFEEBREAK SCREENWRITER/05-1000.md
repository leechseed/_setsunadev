# Divide Your Scenes

Starting from the scene list, look at your scenes and see where you can split locations to create additional scenes.

---

### **Look For...**

1. **Talky Scenes**  
   If all of the information is important, stretch it out over different locations.  

2. **Fight Scenes**  
   If the action is moving, your characters are probably pursuing each other from place to place.  

3. **Party Scenes**  
   Move the eye to different mini-locations in the room. One group may be at the food table, while another is on the balcony.  

4. **Chase Scenes**  
   Characters are probably chasing each other from location to location. Make sure your scenes reflect that.
