# CONNECT THE DOTS — Cohesion Builder

Smooth out your script by adding visible connections between people, events, objects, places, and time.

---

### **1) Connect Characters**
- **Task:** Link random characters via **relatives, friendships, affiliations, or shared world details**.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - What bond forces them to cross paths?  
  - What obligation or history ties them together?

**Entries**
| Pair / Trio | Connection Type (family/friend/org/rival/etc.) | Evidence in Scene (what we *see/hear*) | Payoff Later |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|
|             |                                                  |                                        |              |
|             |                                                  |                                        |              |
|             |                                                  |                                        |              |

---

### **2) Connect to an Event (Common Goal)**
- **Task:** Tie characters to a **single event** that aligns their goals or collisions.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - What is the event?  
  - Why must each character be there?

**Event Hub**
| Event | Who’s Involved | Their Objective at Event | Conflict / Alignment | Outcome Beat |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
|      |                 |                          |                      |              |

---

### **3) Connect Objects to People**
- **Task:** Assign objects that **symbolize**, **enable**, or **complicate** character arcs (luck, love, weapon, proof, leverage).  
- **Prompts:**  
  - Who owns it? What does it *mean*? How does it return later?

**Object Links**
| Object | Owner / Claimant | Symbolic Meaning | Functional Use (tool/weapon/key) | Scene of Introduction | Return / Payoff |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
|        |                   |                  |                                   |                       |                 |

---

### **4) Connect Locations**
- **Task:** Map how locations relate to one another so geography reads as **one world**, not disconnected sets.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - How do we move between them? What changes across borders?

**World Map**
| Location A → B | Path / Transition (door, corridor, street, transit) | Stakes of Crossing | Visual/Audio Bridge | Effect on Pace |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|
|                |                                                      |                    |                     |                |

---

### **5) Connect Time**
- **Task:** Clarify **order of events** or add a **ticking clock**.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - What’s the deadline? What anchors the timeline on-screen?

**Timeline / Clock**
| Beat # | Time Marker (timestamp/day/“hours to go”) | Event / Beat | On-Screen Signal (lower-third, chime, news, sun position) | Consequence of Delay |
|-------:|-------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1      |                                           |              |                                                           |                      |
| 2      |                                           |              |                                                           |                      |
| 3      |                                           |              |                                                           |                      |

### **Cross-Connection Matrix (Optional)**
Track multi-axis ties at a glance.

| Element | Linked Characters | Linked Event(s) | Linked Object(s) | Linked Location(s) | Time Link (deadline/order) | Payoff Scene |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
|         |                   |                 |                  |                    |                            |              |
|         |                   |                 |                  |                    |                            |              |

### **Revision Checklist**
- [ ] Every principal character is meaningfully connected to **at least one** other character.  
- [ ] A **shared event** convenes key players with clear, conflicting objectives.  
- [ ] **Objects** carry meaning and return for payoff (no dead props).  
- [ ] **Locations** feel navigable; transitions are visible and motivated.  
- [ ] **Time** is legible: clear order and/or an explicit clock.
