# The Revelation Rewrite

If your turning point hinges on a revelation, replace passive recall or exposition with **on-page discovery** driven by activity, clues, and skills.

---

### **Rewrite Approach**

- **No Passive Memory** → Replace “she remembers” with a **triggering event**.  
- **No Info-Dump** → Replace “she is told” with **discovery** using clues/skills.  

---

### **Discovery Template**

- **Scene/Sequence**: _____  
- **Triggering Event (what happens that sparks the revelation?)**: _____  
- **Active Investigation (actions taken on-page)**: _____  
- **Clues/Evidence Used**: _____  
- **Skills/Tools Applied**: _____  
- **Obstacle/Complication Introduced**: _____  
- **Revelation (new understanding put into words/images)**: _____  
- **Immediate Behavioral Change (what they do now)**: _____  
- **Consequence (how this alters the next beat/sequence)**: _____  

---

### **Quick Checks**

- Is the revelation **caused by action on the page**? **Yes/No**  
- Can the reader **see** the clues and how they combine? **Yes/No**  
- Does the revelation **force a new choice or tactic**? **Yes/No**
