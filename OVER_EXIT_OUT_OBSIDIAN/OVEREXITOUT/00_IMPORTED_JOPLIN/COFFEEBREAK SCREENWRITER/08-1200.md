# TONAL WRITING — Script Voice Alignment

Define the **tone** of your script and refine scene direction to match it. Use chosen tonal words to shape language, rhythm, and imagery.

---

### **Step 1: Choose Tone**
Pick one word (or a pair) that best fits your work’s tonal intention.  

**Comedy Options:** Whimsical • Dry • Silly • Sarcastic • Cutting-edge • Crass • Smart  
**Drama Options:** Suspenseful • Deep • Intense • Gritty • Sexy • Mournful • Wistful  

**Chosen Tone Word(s):**  
> 

---

### **Step 2: Apply Tone**
During a **10-minute break**, pass through script pages and rewrite scene direction with words/phrases that **reinforce tone**.

---

### **Worksheet Template**
- **Original Action Line:**  
  > 

- **Rewritten Tonal Action Line:**  
  > (Using chosen tone word as guide)

- **Notes:**  
  > (What effect does the rewrite have on mood, pacing, or character perception?)
