# APPLY ETHNICITY AND GENDER — Identity Perspective Worksheet

Use your MC’s experiences with **ethnicity, race, or gender** to bring new depth to scenes. Explore social context, perspective, and lived experience to differentiate the character’s presence.

---

### **1. Rules of Behavior**
- How does the MC’s behavior shift depending on context?  
  - **When part of the crowd:**  
    > 
  - **When singled out as “the other”:**  
    > 

---

### **2. Point of View from Others**
- Commit to showing environments from **outside perspectives**:  
  - **Where is the MC accepted?**  
    >  
  - **Where is the MC rejected?**  
    >  

---

### **3. Obstacles**
- Introduce **emotional and physical obstacles** rooted in lived identity:  
  - Racism:  
    >  
  - Sexism:  
    >  
  - Other barriers (cultural, social, systemic):  
    >  

---

### **4. Counter-Approach**
- Instead of focusing on struggle, highlight:  
  - **Ease in society:**  
    >  
  - **Unwillingness to define self by identity:**  
    >
