# The Payoff Rewrite

Remember those running actions, themes, and jokes—don’t forget the payoffs. Go through your script: wherever you set up new information about a character, find the **matching** scene where you pay it off. If there is no matching scene, **write one** or **cut the setup**.

---

### **Instructions**
1. Identify every **setup** (action/theme/joke/detail).
2. Locate its **payoff** scene.  
3. If missing, **create a payoff** or **remove the setup**.  
4. Ensure the payoff **evolves or reframes** the original setup.

| # | Setup (What is established?) | Setup Location (Act/Seq/Scene) | Payoff (How is it answered/evolved?) | Payoff Location (Act/Seq/Scene) | Type (Action/Theme/Joke/Detail) | Status (Done/Todo/Cut) | Notes |

### **Quick Checks**
- Does every **setup** have a **visible payoff** on the page? **Yes/No**  
- Does the payoff **advance plot or character** (not just echo)? **Yes/No**  
- Are any payoffs **too late/too early** for maximum effect? **Adjust**  
- Do running **themes/jokes/actions** escalate or transform at payoff? **Yes/No**
