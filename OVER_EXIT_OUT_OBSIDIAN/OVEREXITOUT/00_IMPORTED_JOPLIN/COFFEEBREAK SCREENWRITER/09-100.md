# EDIT TO THE STORY — Scene-Level Focus

Refine your editing by clarifying **what matters most** in each scene.

---

### **Guiding Questions**
- **What’s the story of the scene?**  
  > (Summarize the scene’s core purpose in one line)

- **What’s the joke or dramatic moment?**  
  > (Highlight the peak beat — humor, tension, irony, or pathos)

- **What has to be shown?**  
  > (List the non-negotiable visuals, actions, or reveals)

### **Checklist**
- [ ] Each scene has **one clear story beat**.  
- [ ] Humor or drama lands on a **single, sharp moment**.  
- [ ] All **must-show essentials** are preserved.  
- [ ] Cuts or trims do not weaken **story, joke, or reveal**.
