# Restructure Part 2

Using your structure sheet as a guide, take ten minutes per scene or sequence to make the story choices you need to create your new structure.

---

### **Steps**

1. **Compress Events**  
   Go into your script and compress events by weeding out emotional or physical moments that repeat themselves.

2. **Fill Story Holes**  
   Fill the story holes created by your new structure by adding **setup** that may now be missing or **consequences** that may not be there.
