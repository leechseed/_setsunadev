# Develop Your Scenes

Working one scene at a time, go through and develop your scenes by asking the following questions.  
*Remember: you may need to add only one element. Don’t do everything, or you’ll overwrite!*

### **Scene Development Questions**

1. Do you need to give the scene a better sense of **Place**?  
2. Would your scene benefit from **More Dialogue**?  
3. To change the rhythm, should you try out a **Tonal Shift**?  
4. Do you need to add a **New Beat** to the scene?  
5. Would a piece of **Emotional Scene Direction** help tell the story?
