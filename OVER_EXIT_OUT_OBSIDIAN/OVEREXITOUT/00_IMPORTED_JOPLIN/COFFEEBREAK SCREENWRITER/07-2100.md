# FIND THE PERFECT LINE #2 — Monologue Compression

Overcome a stuck line by drafting a full **rant** and then extracting the **one line** that carries the beat.

---

### **Steps**
1. **Write the Rant**  
   - Let the character speak freely in-the-moment. Be indulgent. Spill thoughts, feelings, and impulses without censoring.
2. **Circle One Line**  
   - From that rant, select the single line that expresses the essential point. Everything else gets cut or deferred.

---

### **Monologue Scratchpad**
- **Scene / Beat Context**  
  > (Where are we? What just happened? What must this line accomplish?)

- **Character**  
  > (Name / role)

- **Unfiltered Rant (Write it long):**  
  >
  >
  >

---

### **Line Extraction**
- **Selected “Perfect Line” (verbatim):**  
  > 

- **Why This Line Works (function):**  
  - **Beat it lands:**  
  - **Reveals:** (goal / fear / decision / reversal)  
  - **Effect:** (moves plot / clarifies subtext / buttons the moment)

---

### **Stress Tests (Keep Only If “Yes”)**
- [ ] **Clarity:** The meaning is unambiguous without the rant.  
- [ ] **Energy:** It hits harder *because* everything else is cut.  
- [ ] **Voice:** It sounds like this character now, in this circumstance.  
- [ ] **Utility:** It advances story, turns the beat, or sharpens conflict.  
- [ ] **Economy:** Short enough to memorize; strong enough to quote.

---

### **Before → After (Optional)**
- **Before (Rambly Draft):**  
  >
- **After (Perfect Line in Scene):**  
  >

---

### **Integration Notes**
- **Surrounding Dialogue Adjustments:**  
  - Trim set-up so the line lands clean.  
  - Redirect responses to **react** to the line (not re-explain it).  
  - Replace exposition with action or a new obstacle.
