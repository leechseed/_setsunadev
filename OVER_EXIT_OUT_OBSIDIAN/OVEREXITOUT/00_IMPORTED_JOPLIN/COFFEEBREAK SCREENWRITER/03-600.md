# Exercise S — Beat-Sheet Structure Rewrite

Try one or all of the following to test if your story benefits from a structure rewrite:

---

### **1. Eliminate Sequence 1**
- **Prompt:** What happens if you remove Sequence 1?  
- **Rewrite:** [Does it improve the pace or weaken the setup?]  

---

### **2. Compress Sequences 1–4**
- **Prompt:** What if you compress Sequences 1–4 into two?  
- **Rewrite:** [Does the movie get to the core story faster?]  

---

### **3. Add Activity to Sequences 5–6**
- **Prompt:** Replace “they discuss/they plan” moments with action.  
- **Rewrite:** [What new activities drive these sequences?]  

---

### **4. Change the Goal of Sequence 8**
- **Prompt:** Instead of a wrap-up, make Sequence 8 a “final hurdle.”  
- **Rewrite:** [Define a new physical or emotional goal for the climax.]
