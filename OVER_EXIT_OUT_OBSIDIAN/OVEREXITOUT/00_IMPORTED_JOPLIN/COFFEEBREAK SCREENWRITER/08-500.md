# CREATE SCENE DIRECTION “TELLS” — Subtext Builder

Layer a straightforward scene with **between-the-lines meaning** by identifying what’s unsaid but felt.

---

### **Worksheet Template**
- **Scene:**  
  > (Brief description of the scene setup)

- **Dialogue (On the Page):**  
  > (What’s actually spoken)

- **Character Wishes They Could Say (Unspoken):**  
  > (What the character truly wants to express but can’t)

- **“Tell” of the Scene (Subtext):**  
  > (Underlying truth, tension, or meaning that plays beneath the words)

---

### **Example Snip**
- **Scene:** A daughter visits her estranged father in the hospital.  
- **Dialogue:** *“You look tired, Dad. Want some water?”*  
- **Wishes She Could Say:** *“I’m scared you’re dying and I don’t know how to forgive you.”*  
- **Tell:** Fear and regret mask as small talk.

### **Scene Tells Log**
| Scene ID / Title | Dialogue (On Page) | Unspoken Line (Wish) | Tell (Subtext/Meaning) |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
|                  |                     |                       |                        |
|                  |                     |                       |                        |
|                  |                     |                       |                        |

---

### **Checklist**
- [ ] Dialogue is **surface-level** but layered with implication.  
- [ ] Subtext reveals what the character **can’t or won’t say**.  
- [ ] The “tell” shifts how the scene **reads and lands emotionally**.
