# Exercise Y — Find Scenes Through Object Payoff

---

## **Step 1: Simple Setup → Payoff**
| Object (Setup: Act 1 / 2A) | Payoff (Act 2B / Act 3) |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| [Object 1]                  | [Payoff 1]              |
| [Object 2]                  | [Payoff 2]              |
| [Object 3]                  | [Payoff 3]              |

---

## **Step 2: Add Placement Tracking**
| Object Introduced | Setup Location (Act 1 / 2A) | Payoff (Act 2B / Act 3) |
|--------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| [Object 1]         | [Scene / Act placement]      | [Payoff placement]      |
| [Object 2]         | [Scene / Act placement]      | [Payoff placement]      |
| [Object 3]         | [Scene / Act placement]      | [Payoff placement]      |

## **Step 3: Expanded Scene Breakdown**
| Object     | Setup Scene | Setup Act | Payoff Scene | Payoff Act | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|------------|-------|
| [Object 1] | [Scene #]   | [Act #]   | [Scene #]    | [Act #]    | [Symbolic / narrative notes] |
| [Object 2] | [Scene #]   | [Act #]   | [Scene #]    | [Act #]    | [Symbolic / narrative notes] |
| [Object 3] | [Scene #]   | [Act #]   | [Scene #]    | [Act #]    | [Symbolic / narrative notes] |
