# SCENE TRANSITIONS — Flow Builder

Improve scene flow by choosing deliberate transition tactics. Use one or more of the options below, then document how the transition carries story, tone, or information forward.

---

### **Transition Options**
1. **Mirror the Last Image**  
   - Recreate or invert the previous scene’s final visual.  
   - *Example:* Close on a dripping faucet → Open on torrential rain.

2. **Pick Up Last Dialogue**  
   - Start with a response, echo, or contradiction to the previous line.  
   - *Example:* “We’re safe.” → Smash cut: “We are not safe.”

3. **Answer the Prior Question**  
   - Open with the answer or the consequence of not having one.  
   - *Example:* “Where’s the key?” → Open on the key turning in a lock.

4. **Twist the Setup**  
   - Subvert the expectation planted in the last scene.  
   - *Example:* Prep for a party → Open on a crime scene in the same room.

### **Worksheet Template (Choose One or Combine)**
- **Previous Scene Last Beat (image/line/question/setup):**  
  > 

- **Chosen Transition Tactic(s):**  
  > (Mirror / Pick Up Dialogue / Answer Question / Twist Setup)

- **Opening Beat of New Scene (verbatim):**  
  > 

- **Function of Transition:**  
  > (Advance plot / escalate stakes / shift tone / reveal character / clarify geography)

- **Intended Effect on Audience:**  
  > (Surprise / continuity / dread / irony / relief)

### **Transition Log**
| # | From Scene (ID/Title) | Last Beat (Image/Line/Question) | Tactic Used | New Scene Opening (1–2 lines) | Function (plot/tone/info) | Works? (Y/N) | Notes / Fix |
|---|------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 |                        |                                  |             |                               |                           |              |             |
| 2 |                        |                                  |             |                               |                           |              |             |
| 3 |                        |                                  |             |                               |                           |              |             |

### **Checklist**
- [ ] Transition **connects concretely** to the prior scene’s final beat.  
- [ ] Opening beat **does new work** (not a repeat).  
- [ ] **Tone carries or intentionally shifts** with purpose.  
- [ ] Geography/time are **immediately legible**.  
- [ ] The transition **reduces friction** and **adds momentum**.
