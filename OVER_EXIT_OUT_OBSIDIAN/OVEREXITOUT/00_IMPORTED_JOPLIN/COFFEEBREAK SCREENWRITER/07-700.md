# The Choice Rewrite

Convey a character’s emotional turning point by **showing a choice being made**. Do your pages show one action being taken over another?

---

### **Choice Moment Template**

- **Scene**: _____  
- **Character**: _____  
- **Choice A (Abandoned)**: _____  
- **Choice B (Taken)**: _____  
- **Visible Decision Beat (on-page action/image)**: _____  
- **Immediate Consequence**: _____  
- **Emotional Shift (before → after)**: _____ → _____  
- **Cost/Risk Acknowledged**: _____  
- **Setup/Callback (what earlier beat does this pay off?)**: _____  

---

### **Quick Checks**

- Does the page **depict** the decision (no internal summary)? **Yes/No**  
- Is there a **cost** to the chosen action? **Yes/No**  
- Does this choice **re-route the next sequence**? **Yes/No**
