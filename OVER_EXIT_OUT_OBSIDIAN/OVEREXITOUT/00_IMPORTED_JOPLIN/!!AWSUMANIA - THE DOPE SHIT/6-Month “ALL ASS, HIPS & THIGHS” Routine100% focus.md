6-Month “ALL ASS, HIPS & THIGHS” Routine100% focused on building the roundest, perkiest, most fuckable Filipino bubble butt + thick hips and thighs that scream “top 1% invite” for Conquest/Nasty Boys ATL.
Zero upper-body fluff. This is pure lower-body hypertrophy + glute isolation.Train 5 days/week, 60–75 min per session. Rest 60–90 sec between sets (45 sec on isolation moves).
Progressive overload every week: add 5–10 lbs or 2–3 reps when you hit the top of the rep range with good form.Month

3–4
Peak volume + glute roundness (pump chaser phase)
5 days + 1 optional “pump day” Saturday
Same big lifts, but now:  
Hip Thrust → 6 × 12–20 (last 2 sets drop sets)  
Squat → 5 × 10–12 (1–2 back-off sets @ 80%)  
Add Deficit Reverse Lunge – 4 × 12/leg  
Add Glute-Focused Hyperextensions (round back) – 4 × 15–20

5 days + 2 HIIT/ass-pump days
Drop to 4 working sets on compounds, but intensity ↑  
Hip Thrust → 4 × 12–20 (heavy + 1 feeder set of 50 reps light)  
Squat → 4 × 10–12  
Replace RDL with Sumo Deadlift (wider stance hits glutes/adductors harder) – 4 × 8–12
