Areas & Districts
- Base off of Florida biomes
- Outside of the ring

There's two ways to live in the South
- Outside the ring
- Inside the ring

- If you're inside, there are rules. many rules. You'll get further if you know them. to break them, to bend them, or to tow the line.
- There's only one thing that matters and that's to serve the cause. Your purpose and your meaning is ordered upon you. And by your own merit, you must strive to meet it. 

- Outside the ring, there is only nature. and only one rule: opportunity. But you make your own or die by it. Your purpose and your meaning is yours manifest And by your own will and courage you must fight to meet it.
