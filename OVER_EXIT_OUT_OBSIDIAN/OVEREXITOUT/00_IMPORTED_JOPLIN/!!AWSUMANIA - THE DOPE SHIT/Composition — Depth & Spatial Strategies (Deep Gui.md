## Terminology Primer (Read First)

- **Eye Level / Horizon Line** → Viewer’s eye height; all perspective is measured relative to this. Put simply: it’s where “flat” meets “far.”
- **Vanishing Point (VP)** → Where parallel lines (in 3D) appear to meet in 2D.
- **1/2/3-Point Perspective** → One VP (frontal), two VPs (corner view), three VPs (tilt up/down adds vertical convergence).
- **Curvilinear (4/5-Point)** → Fisheye-like perspective mapping across a curved field; used sparingly.
- **Foreshortening** → Apparent compression of lengths pointing toward/away from the viewer.
- **Occlusion / Overlap** → One object blocking part of another—our strongest depth cue.
- **Atmospheric Perspective** → Distance reduces contrast, saturation, and sharpness; shifts color cooler/lighter.
- **Value Key** → Overall lightness bias of the image (high-key = mostly light, low-key = mostly dark).
- **Value Stepping** → Deliberate value differences between planes (fore darker, mid midtone, distance lighter—*or* the reverse).
- **Cast Shadow vs Form Shadow** → Cast = shadow thrown onto other surfaces; Form = shadow on the object itself because it turns away from light.
- **Terminator** → The line where light turns to shadow on a curved form.
- **Ambient Occlusion (AO)** → Soft darkening in tight creases/contacts where light can’t reach.
- **Rim Light** → Thin highlight that separates a subject from background.
- **Depth of Field (DoF)** → The range that appears acceptably sharp. Narrow DoF isolates; deep DoF explains context.
- **Hyperfocal Distance** → Focus distance that maximizes depth of field from roughly half that distance to infinity.
- **Circle of Confusion (CoC)** → The blur circle size your system treats as “sharp enough.” Smaller CoC = stricter sharpness.
- **Keystone Distortion** → Converging verticals when camera is tilted; fix by leveling or perspective correction.
- **Parallax** → Near objects shift more than far ones when the camera/viewer moves.
- **Dolly Zoom (Vertigo Effect)** → Zoom while dollying to keep subject size constant but warp background scale—weaponized depth.

> Depth is **not** a single trick. It’s the **stack**: planes + perspective + values + edges + atmosphere + lens behavior.

---

## How to Use This Guide
- Start with **planes** and **perspective** (geometry), then enforce with **value stepping**, **color falloff**, and **edge control**.
- Decide your **value key** early; it dictates how you step planes.
- Choose **one** lens behavior (wide exaggeration vs tele compression) and design around it—don’t fight it.

## Depth Building Blocks

### 3.1 Planes: Fore / Mid / Back
**What**  
At minimum, show **three layers**. The brain expects this.

**How**  
- Plant a **foreground anchor** (silhouette, frame, or texture).  
- Stage the **subject** in mid; reserve **background** for separation.  
- Ensure value/edge differences between planes.

**Fixes**  
If flat: add a near-plane object (even a soft dark shape) and push the background lighter/softer.

**Checklist**  
- Can you label three planes in one second? If not, add or separate them.

---

### 3.2 Occlusion & Overlap
**What**  
Front objects **cover** back objects → instant depth.

**How**  
- Overlap decisively; avoid **kissing tangents**.  
- Use occlusion to clarify figure–ground.

**Fixes**  
If edges just touch, **separate** or **overlap** clearly; adjust pose/prop to break coincidence.

---

### 3.3 Scale & Diminution
**What**  
Things shrink with distance.

**How**  
- Include a known-size object (human, doorway) as a **scale reference**.  
- Step sizes consistently into depth.

**Fixes**  
If the world feels toy-like, your scale steps are too aggressive or lens too wide without a foreground anchor.

---

### 3.4 Atmospheric Perspective
**What**  
Air eats contrast and saturation with distance.

**How**  
- Distance: **lighter**, **bluer/cooler**, **less saturated**, **less sharp**.  
- Foreground: **richer**, **warmer**, **sharper**.

**Fixes**  
Lift background blacks and drop saturation by 10–40%. Add mild bluish tint far back.

---

### 3.5 Value Key & Stepping
**What**  
Assign distinct value ranges to planes.

**Patterns**  
- **High-key landscape**: Fore (mid–dark), Mid (mid), Back (light).  
- **Noir** (reverse): Fore (light rim on dark), Mid (dark mass), Back (mid).

**Fixes**  
If planes merge, push the **delta** between them. Values lead; color follows.

---

### 3.6 Color & Saturation Falloff
**What**  
Saturation drops with distance; warms advance, cools recede.

**How**  
- Keep **warm accents** in near/mid; cool the background.  
- One **hot accent** near the subject; keep background neutral.

**Fixes**  
Color noise? Reduce hue spread; unify background temperature.

---

### 3.7 Texture & Detail Gradients
**What**  
Fine detail lives **near**; distance blurs it.

**How**  
- Highest **micro-contrast** at the subject; simplify texture elsewhere.  
- Use frequency separation: big shapes at distance, fine texture up close.

**Fixes**  
If attention scatters, kill micro-contrast in the background.

---

### 3.8 Edge Hierarchy in Depth
**What**  
Sharp edges advance; soft edges recede.

**How**  
- Keep the **5 sharpest edges** around the subject plane.  
- Use **lost edges** where background and subject share a value (away from focal).

**Fixes**  
Random crispness? Blur offenders; sharpen only where you want the eye.

---

### 3.9 Light & Shadow (Form, Cast, Rim, Volumetrics)
**What**  
Light sculpts depth.

**How**  
- **Form shadow** defines curvature (terminator clean and logical).  
- **Cast shadows** glue objects to ground (direction consistent; **contact shadow** darkest).  
- **Rim light** for separation against darker backgrounds.  
- **Volumetric** shafts (god rays) imply space when they cut through haze.

**Fixes**  
Confused lighting? Pick **one** key light, one fill strategy, and a consistent shadow direction.

---

### 3.10 Perspective Systems (Eye Level, 1/2/3-Point, Curvilinear)
**What**  
Geometry that tells the viewer how they’re oriented.

**How**  
- Mark **eye level** first.  
- **1-point**: look straight down an axis (hallway); one VP on horizon.  
- **2-point**: look at a **corner**; two VPs on horizon.  
- **3-point**: tilt up/down; verticals converge to a third VP.  
- **Curvilinear** (4/5-point): only when you *want* fisheye.

**Fixes**  
- **Keystone** verticals by leveling camera or correcting in post.  
- If VPs drift, build a **perspective grid** and snap to it.

---

### 3.11 Foreshortening & Gesture in Space
**What**  
Forms pointing at you compress.

**How**  
- Lead with **big shapes**; sub-shapes diminish rapidly along the axis.  
- Preserve **cross-contours** to explain turning form.

**Fixes**  
Rubber-arm syndrome? You kept segment lengths constant. Shorten each segment toward camera.

---

### 3.12 Depth of Field & Focus Control
**What**  
Focus directs depth and attention.

**How**  
- **Shallow DoF**: isolate subject; blur fore/back.  
- **Deep DoF**: storytelling environments.  
- Set **hyperfocal** for landscapes (sharp from near to infinity).  
- **Focus stacking** for macro/product.

**Fixes**  
If nothing is crisp, raise f-stop or place focus exactly on the subject’s **contrast edge** (eyes for portraits).

---

### 3.13 Parallax & Motion Cues
**What**  
Movement reveals layers.

**How**  
- Pan with subject: background streaks, subject stays crisp.  
- **Dolly zoom**: keep subject size, change background scale for dramatic depth warp.  
- In animation/boards: slide near layer faster than far layer.

**Fixes**  
If motion confuses, keep **one crisp island**.

---

### 3.14 Framing for Depth
**What**  
Use near objects as **frames** (arches, foliage, doorways).

**How**  
- Foreground darker/softer; subject brighter/sharper inside.  
- Frames should **point inward**, not compete.

**Fixes**  
If frame steals attention, drop its contrast/texture.

---

### 3.15 Negative Space as Distance
**What**  
Empty areas can read as air between planes.

**How**  
- Use **graduated** backgrounds (value/temperature shift) to imply range.  
- Leave breathing room between planes; avoid “stuck together” shapes.

---

### 3.16 Reflections, Transparency & Planes
**What**  
Mirrors/water/windows add spatial planes.

**How**  
- Keep reflected **value lower** than the source (usually).  
- For glass, show **two edges** (near/far) and slight distortions.

**Fixes**  
If reflection dominates, darken it or break with ripples/angle.

---

## Genre Playbooks for Depth

- **Landscape**  
  - Foreground anchor (rock/grass), mid subject (tree/structure), aerial perspective to horizon.  
  - Hyperfocal focus; horizon away from heads; grad ND or value gradient for sky.

- **Portrait**  
  - Subject mid-plane; soft foreground occluder (plant, chair back).  
  - Separate with rim light; background 1–2 stops lower contrast.

- **Architecture**  
  - Correct verticals (no accidental keystone).  
  - Repeating elements as scale steps; reflective surfaces as extra planes.

- **Still Life / Product**  
  - Cast shadows for grounding; AO at contacts; shallow DoF or staged ramps.  
  - Keep background texture low to prevent depth noise.

- **Street / Documentary**  
  - Layer silhouettes; frame with doorways; atmospheric haze (backlight) on busy streets.

- **Action / Sports**  
  - Diagonals + parallax via panning; foreground streaks; subject rim-lit off background.

- **Film / Storyboards**  
  - Establish eye level; keep it consistent across reverse shots.  
  - Foreground “dirty” frames to sell depth; haze for night exteriors.

- **UI / Data Viz**  
  - Use **elevation** (shadow, blur) sparingly; depth cues must not kill readability.

---

## Diagnostics & Stress Tests

- **Three-Plane Test** → Can you name fore/mid/back instantly? If not, add them.  
- **Grayscale Check** → Do the planes separate in **value** without color?  
- **Edge Audit** → Are the **sharpest edges** on the subject plane?  
- **Silhouette Pass** → Subject reads in silhouette against background?  
- **Perspective Grid** → Do major edges actually converge to the chosen VPs?  
- **Haze Sweep** → Background blacks lifted? Saturation tapered with distance?  
- **Flip & Squint** → Depth should survive inversion and blur.

## Exercises That Build Skill Fast

1. **Plane Builder (10 min)**  
   - From any ref, block **only** three flat values for fore/mid/back. No details.

2. **AO & Cast Shadow Drill**  
   - Paint base tones; add only AO and cast shadows. Watch forms glue to ground.

3. **Value Stepping Ladder**  
   - Create 5 thumbnails varying plane values (dark fore → light back; reverse; mid sandwich). Note which pops.

4. **Perspective Walk**  
   - Draw a simple street in 1-point, 2-point, 3-point. Mark eye level in bold. Place figures to scale.

5. **Foreshortening Chunks**  
   - Cylinders/boxes pointing at camera. Halve segment lengths toward the viewer; add cross-contours.

6. **Lens Twins**  
   - Frame the same subject “wide exaggeration” vs “tele compression.” Annotate what changes in depth cues.

7. **Parallax Loop**  
   - Make a 4-frame sequence sliding foreground faster than background; keep subject crisp.

8. **DoF Island**  
   - Build a scene where **one** plane is sharp. Everything else soft. Make it still read.

## Common Pitfalls (and the Cure)

- **Kissing Tangents** → Depth collapses.  
  *Cure*: Overlap decisively or separate with value.

- **Midtone Soup** → No plane separation.  
  *Cure*: Value stepping; push deltas.

- **Random Sharpness** → Eye ping-pongs.  
  *Cure*: Edge hierarchy—sharpen the subject plane only.

- **Accidental Keystone** → Feels wrong, not dynamic.  
  *Cure*: Level camera or correct verticals.

- **Color-Only Depth** → Dies in grayscale.  
  *Cure*: Build with values first; let color assist.

- **Background Too Loud** → Subject lost.  
  *Cure*: Desaturate/soften background; add rim or silhouette contrast.

- **One-Plane Lighting** → Everything lit the same.  
  *Cure*: Directional key + controlled falloff; shadow mass to unify.

---

## Workflow & Setup (Overlays, Tools, Lenses)

- **Overlays**: Perspective grids (1/2/3-point), horizon bars, haze gradients, edge-sharpness masks.  
- **Apps**:  
  - Photoshop/Krita: perspective grid layers; Gradient Map for aerial perspective; Lens Correction for keystone.  
  - Procreate: add perspective guide; Gaussian Blur for DoF tests; color balance for cool-back warms.  
- **Cameras/Lenses**:  
  - **Wide (14–35mm FF)** exaggerates depth; needs a **foreground anchor**.  
  - **Tele (85–200mm+)** compresses depth; great for layered silhouettes and subject isolation.  
  - Use **tripod + level** for architecture; stop down for deep DoF landscapes; open up for portrait isolation.  
  - Remember **hyperfocal** charts (or app) for “everything-sharp” landscapes.

---

## Cheat Sheet Summary

- Depth = **planes + perspective + values + edges + atmosphere + lens behavior**.  
- Pick a **value key** and **step** your planes.  
- Overlap decisively; protect silhouettes; reserve **sharpest edges** for the subject plane.  
- Cool, desaturate, and soften the background; warm, saturate, and sharpen near/mid.  
- Choose lens behavior and commit: **wide = exaggerate**, **tele = compress**.  
- If it fails in **grayscale** and **blur**, it isn’t built yet.

---

## Extended Glossary

- **Ambient Occlusion (AO)** → Soft contact darkening where light can’t reach (creases, ground contact).  
- **Cast Shadow** → Shadow thrown by an object onto another surface; carries shape info and direction.  
- **Circle of Confusion (CoC)** → The blur diameter considered “sharp enough” by your sensor/print standard.  
- **Curvilinear Perspective** → Mapping straight lines to curves (fisheye) for ultra-wide views.  
- **Diminution** → Progressive size reduction with distance; basic perspective cue.  
- **Dolly Zoom** → Simultaneous dolly and opposite-direction zoom; background scale distorts while subject size holds.  
- **Eye Level / Horizon** → Plane at viewer’s eye height; determines VP placement.  
- **Foreshortening** → Compression of lengths toward the viewer; requires aggressive shortening of segments.  
- **Form Shadow / Terminator** → Intrinsic shadow on a form; terminator is the transition edge.  
- **Hyperfocal Distance** → Focus point that maximizes depth of field to infinity for a given aperture/FOV/CoC.  
- **Keystone** → Converging verticals from camera tilt; fix by leveling or post correction.  
- **Parallax** → Relative motion of near vs far objects during camera/viewer movement; stronger near = deeper feel.  
- **Rim Light** → Narrow highlight that separates subject from background.  
- **Value Key** → Overall lightness bias of the image (high-, mid-, low-key).  
- **Value Stepping** → Assigning distinct value bands to planes for separation.  
- **Vanishing Point** → Apparent meeting point of parallels in perspective.  
- **Volumetric Light** → Visible beams through haze/particles that describe space.
