## Terminology Primer (Read First)

- **Hero / Hero Image** → The primary subject or module that must win first glance.
- **Packshot** → Clean, front-facing product shot showing brand/label clearly.
- **Shelf Read** → How fast a product is recognized at a small size or in clutter.
- **Key Art** → The single canonical promotional image for a film/game/show.
- **Blocking (Staging)** → Placement/orientation of subjects to control silhouette and flow.
- **Cheat to Camera** → Slightly turning forms so the important face/label reads flat to lens.
- **Practical (Film)** → A light source visible in-scene (lamp, window) used as a cue/motivation.
- **Planar Lighting** → Light that emphasizes flat planes (useful for packaging, architecture).
- **Specular** → Mirror-like highlight; strong specular = glossy, high “snap.”
- **Inverse Square Law** → Light intensity drops fast with distance; use it to control falloff.
- **High-Key / Low-Key** → Overall value bias mostly light / mostly dark (see Core Principles).
- **CTA (Call to Action)** → Button or instruction that the layout wants clicked, now.

> If a term isn’t listed here, it’s defined in earlier guides or in this document’s **Extended Glossary**.

## How to Use This Guide
- For each genre: grab **Intent & Priorities**, pick **Armature/Flow**, enforce **Depth/Lighting**, then do **Placement/Crop**.  
- Use the **Checklist** ruthlessly. Fix what fails. Don’t argue with results.

---

## Landscape
**Intent & Priorities**  
Sense of place; scale; atmosphere. First read = subject landmark or light event.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Thirds** for horizon; **S-curve** for roads/rivers; **Diagonal thrust** for slopes.  
- Avoid centering horizon unless symmetry/mirror is the point.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Fore/Mid/Back with **atmospheric perspective**. Foreground anchor (rock, grass, figure).  
- Wide lens? Put something compelling in the near plane or it’ll look empty.

**Light & Color**  
- Low sun for raking texture; protect value hierarchy (sky ≠ blown).  
- Warm accents in near/mid; cool the distance.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Keep horizon off heads; protect silhouettes (trees, peaks).  
- Crop decisively—no slivers of almost-something on edges.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Midtone soup; horizon dead center; no foreground; tiny subject lost in noise.

**Checklist**  
Focal in 1 sec? Three planes? Clean horizon? Foreground leads **in**?

**Exercises**  
Three thumbnails per scene: (A) low horizon, (B) high horizon, (C) centered symmetry; compare in grayscale.

---

## Portrait (Headshot & Environmental)
**Intent & Priorities**  
The person—eyes first—then story context (environmental).

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Eyes on upper third / phi**. **C-curve** or **L-composition** to cradle.  
- For environmental: **Diagonal thrust** to lead into subject.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Separate head from background (value, color, or rim).  
- Soft fore occluder for depth; background 1–2 stops less contrast.

**Light & Color**  
- Catchlights; soft key + controlled fill; avoid raccoon eyes.  
- Skin tones rule; let background be cooler/less saturated.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- **Don’t crop at neck/chin/wrists/elbows**. Keep lead room in gaze direction.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Horizon through head; busy background; equal sharpness everywhere.

**Checklist**  
Eyes sharp? Clean silhouette? Headroom/chinroom sane? Background muted?

**Exercises**  
One subject, 6 safe crops; then 3 environmental portraits with story props that don’t steal the read.

---

## Still Life / Product (E-comm & Advertising)
**Intent & Priorities**  
Clarity of form & label (e-comm). Desire & story (advertising).

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Triangles** for sets; **thirds/phi** for hero placement.  
- For ad comps, **Spiral** into brand mark or feature.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Shallow DoF for isolation or deep DoF for sets—decide.  
- Cast shadows + AO to glue objects; avoid floating.

**Light & Color**  
- Control **speculars**; define shape with edge highlights.  
- Background simpler than product; brand color as accent only.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Cheat labels **flat to camera**; avoid tangent merges with props.  
- Leave copy space where layout needs it.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Hot, blown speculars; label glare; over-busy surfaces.

**Checklist**  
Brand readable at thumbnail? Form readable in grayscale? No tangent disasters?

**Exercises**  
Shoot a glossy bottle: one broad softbox pass, one hard-edge rim pass. Compare label legibility.

---

## Architecture (Exterior & Interior)
**Intent & Priorities**  
Structure, rhythm, materiality; human scale.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Symmetry** for monuments; **diagonals** for approach; **repetition rhythms** for facades.  
- Interiors: **L-composition** or **1-point** for axial statements; **2-point** for corners.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Correct verticals (no accidental keystone).  
- Layer view: foreground frame (door/column) → volume → opening/light.

**Light & Color**  
- Planar lighting for materials; avoid mixed color casts unless narrative.  
- Interiors: use **practicals** to anchor warm spots; daylight as cool fill.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Keep lines true; don’t amputate key features at the frame.  
- Include a human or familiar object occasionally for scale.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Tilted horizons; chaotic furniture; blown windows.

**Checklist**  
Verticals plumb? Clear pathway? Material reads? Exposure range controlled?

**Exercises**  
Same room in 1-point vs 2-point; annotate mood and spatial clarity differences.

---

## Street / Documentary
**Intent & Priorities**  
Decisive moment + legible value design. Story beats first, cleverness later.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Thirds** for safety; **diagonals** for motion; **Zig-zag** for layered crowds.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Layer silhouettes; backlight haze/rain for separation.  
- Fore occluders (door frames, people) to sell space.

**Light & Color**  
- Value hierarchy over color. Kill color noise if it hurts the read.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Protect face silhouettes; avoid mergers; leave walk room.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Everything midtone; clutter with no hero; horizon through heads.

**Checklist**  
Subject first in 1 sec? Clean story beat? Exit vectors blocked?

**Exercises**  
Shoot 10 frames with a single value rule: “face = brightest junction.” Cull hard.

---

## Action / Sports
**Intent & Priorities**  
Peak action; direction; impact.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Diagonal thrust**, **Golden Triangle**, **Zig-zag** steps to the moment.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Pan for parallax; blur background; keep one **crisp island** (subject).

**Light & Color**  
- Back/rim light for separation; avoid muddy uniforms/backgrounds.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Extra **walk room**; crop tighter on trailing side; keep ball/equipment in frame.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Centering by habit; equal sharpness everywhere; clipped limbs.

**Checklist**  
Is direction obvious? Is the hero sharp? Is the moment actually peak?

**Exercises**  
One play, 5 crops. Pick the one that screams speed the loudest in grayscale.

---

## Wildlife / Nature
**Intent & Priorities**  
Behavior + environment; ethics of distance; clarity of animal form.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Thirds/phi** for the head; **L-composition** or **S-curve** for habitat.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Tele compression for clean backgrounds or wide with foreground habitat.  
- Separate subject via value/temperature difference.

**Light & Color**  
- Early/late light; avoid harsh midday unless silhouette is the story.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- **Lead room** in gaze/motion; don’t amputate tails/ears.  
- Keep horizon off the head/neck.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Busy grass/branches merging with face; tiny subject.

**Checklist**  
Eye visible and sharp? Clean outline? Behavior readable?

**Exercises**  
Compose the same animal once environmental, once isolating; compare narrative feel.

---

## Macro
**Intent & Priorities**  
Form and texture; abstraction vs identification.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Spiral** around focal detail; **C-curve** cradle; **radial** for flowers.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Razor-thin DoF—decide exactly what is sharp. Focus stack if you need ID clarity.

**Light & Color**  
- Control speculars; use diffused sources; avoid color cast from surfaces.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Don’t center by default; give negative space to breathe; avoid edge kisses on delicate forms.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Everything equally crunchy; no focal; background noise.

**Checklist**  
One crisp focal? Background unobtrusive? Edge discipline held?

**Exercises**  
Shoot the same subject with (A) single crisp edge, (B) full stack; decide which serves intent.

---

## Food & Beverage
**Intent & Priorities**  
Appetite appeal; texture; steam/condensation cues.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Triangles** (plate + props); **L-composition** (table edge + prop).  
- **S-curve** for sauces/utensils leading to bite.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Shallow DoF for hero bite; AO at plate contacts; clean background.

**Light & Color**  
- Back/side light for texture; control white balance for appetizing warmth.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Avoid cropping through the main bite; leave room for type if needed.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Greasy glare; dead greens; messy crumbs stealing focus.

**Checklist**  
Texture alive? Whites neutral? Label/bite path clear?

**Exercises**  
Same dish: hard side light vs big soft backlight. Which reads tastier?

---

## Fashion / Editorial
**Intent & Priorities**  
Garment design + attitude; silhouette first.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Diagonal thrust** for energy; **near-symmetry** for iconic looks.  
- **S-curve** for elegance.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Simple background; value separation; controlled motion blur only if intentional.

**Light & Color**  
- Specular control on fabrics; keep skin honest; gels tastefully if story-backed.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Don’t amputate at joints; protect garment lines; give walk room.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Background louder than wardrobe; horizon cutting through waist; sloppy hands.

**Checklist**  
Silhouette clean? Fabric texture readable? Pose serving garment?

**Exercises**  
Pose library: 10 silhouettes in pure black on gray. If it’s not interesting in silhouette, it won’t be in color.

---

## Event / Concert
**Intent & Priorities**  
Energy; hero moments; crowd context.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Radial burst** (lights to performer); **diagonal** mic/arm lines.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Haze + backlights for layers; keep one crisp island (face/instrument).

**Light & Color**  
- Mixed sources—embrace but manage value; avoid clipping highlights.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Keep hands/instruments intact; avoid mic-in-face tangents.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Blown LED walls; no subject separation; cluttered stage junk.

**Checklist**  
Face readable? Rim/exposure controlled? Crowd/story included on purpose?

**Exercises**  
Shoot the same song from three angles: wide context, mid energy, tight hero.

---

## Film / TV / Storyboards
**Intent & Priorities**  
Readable beats; continuity; emotional framing.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Thirds** for safety; **center** for confrontation; **doorway frames** for power.  
- Keep horizon consistent across shot–reverse.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Dirty foregrounds; consistent eye line and lensing; haze for night exteriors.

**Light & Color**  
- Motivated sources (**practicals**); chiaroscuro for control.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Headroom per shot size (CU/MCU/MS). Protect screen direction and look room.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Axis breaks (180°), horizon drift, inconsistent lens language.

**Checklist**  
Beat clear in 1 sec? Screen direction intact? Focal path set for the next cut?

**Exercises**  
Rewrite a 6-shot sequence in three lens languages: wide/normal/tele. Compare emotional read.

---

## Illustration / Comics (Panels & Pages)
**Intent & Priorities**  
Panel clarity; page rhythm; balloon flow.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Z-pattern** (LTR) or mirrored (RTL); **diagonals** for action panels.  
- Reserve **center punch** panels for key beats.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Fore silhouettes; atmospheric perspective; consistent horizon across panels in a scene.

**Light & Color**  
- Value read first; color for mood and accents; keep palette per scene.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Protect word balloon space; avoid tangents with panel borders.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Speech bubbles blocking faces; equal panel weights; busy midtones.

**Checklist**  
Can a new reader follow without rereads? Is the hero panel unmissable?

**Exercises**  
Thumbnail one page three ways: (A) diagonal action spine, (B) center punch reveal, (C) staircase beats.

---

## Concept Art / Key Art
**Intent & Priorities**  
Instant world + hook; marketable silhouette.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Spiral** to hero; **diagonal** energy; **radial inward** for destiny vibes.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Fore frame → mid action → atmospheric back landmark.

**Light & Color**  
- Big value shapes; selective speculars; color script aligned to theme.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Space for logos/taglines; avoid edge kisses; multiple alt ratios pre-planned.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Over-detail everywhere; no single hero; illegible values.

**Checklist**  
Hero silhouette iconic? Flow to logo/CTA? Grayscale poster still works?

**Exercises**  
Produce a 3-value poster first; add color last. If it dies, rebuild values.

---

## UI/UX & Graphic Design
**Intent & Priorities**  
Task completion; scannability; one CTA.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Z-pattern** for hero pages; **F-pattern** for text; modular/baseline grids.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Minimal: elevation (shadow/blur) only where hierarchy needs it.

**Light & Color**  
- Contrast for readability; 60/30/10 color dominance; reserve accent for CTA.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Predictable alignment; generous whitespace; safe areas for responsiveness.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Too many accents; hero lost; inconsistent spacing.

**Checklist**  
Primary action obvious? Readable at 100% and 67% zoom? Contrast passes WCAG basics?

**Exercises**  
Design one screen thrice: (A) Z-pattern hero, (B) F-pattern article, (C) dashboard modular grid. Compare first-click heat.

---

## Data Visualization / Infographics
**Intent & Priorities**  
Truth first; one story per chart.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Z/F patterns** for layouts; visual path from title → highlight → takeaway.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Avoid fake 3D unless encoding depth meaningfully.

**Light & Color**  
- Use color sparingly to encode categories; value for emphasis.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Legends close to data; labels where eyes already are.

**Common Pitfalls**  
Chartjunk; too many hues; buried takeaway.

**Checklist**  
Can a smart layperson state the insight in 5 sec? Labels readable without hunting?

**Exercises**  
Tell the same story as bar, line, dot plot; pick the one with the cleanest first read.

---

## Social Thumbnails (YouTube/Shorts/TikTok)
**Intent & Priorities**  
Micro-second skim; face + promise.

**Armature / Flow**  
- **Center/near-center** hero; **diagonal** prop/text for energy.

**Depth Strategy**  
- Simple background; heavy separation (rim, glow used carefully).

**Light & Color**  
- High contrast; limited palette; one saturated accent.

**Placement & Cropping**  
- Avoid tiny type; eyes above midline; leave safe margins (mobile crops).

Wall-of-text; muddy face; bland color.

**Checklist**  
Readable at 120×120 px? Face/emotion clear? Single promise?

**Exercises**  
Export 3 variants; A/B at small size; keep the one you can read from 6 feet away.

---
