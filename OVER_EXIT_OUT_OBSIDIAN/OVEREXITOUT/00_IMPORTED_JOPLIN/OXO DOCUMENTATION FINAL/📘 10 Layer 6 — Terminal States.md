# 📘 Layer 6 — Terminal States  
## Resolution Forms (Canonical Set)

---


## 1. Containment — *How failure stabilizes*
**The system holds.**

> Pressure is absorbed, isolated, or rerouted. Individuals may change, suffer, or disappear, but the structure remains intact.

---

## 2. Attrition — *How loss accumulates*
**Survival continues at diminishing capacity.**

> The system persists while participants erode; cost compounds until continuation itself becomes the burden.

---

## 3. Exhaustion — *How resistance ends*
**Opposition ceases without victory.**

> Energy, will, or resources deplete. Nothing is resolved; action simply stops.

---

## 4. Displacement — *How problems move*
**The outcome relocates without improvement.**

> Pressure shifts actors, locations, or scales while preserving the same dynamics elsewhere.

---

## 5. Adaptation — *How systems incorporate threat*
**Disruption is absorbed and normalized.**

> What once resisted becomes procedural, regulated, or commodified; the system grows stronger.

---

## 6. Fragmentation — *How coherence breaks locally*
**The system remains, but continuity fails.**

> Interfaces rupture, coordination degrades, or meaning splinters without total collapse.

---

## 7. Collapse — *How systems actually end*
**A sustaining condition fails.**

> Accumulated pressure breaches a specific dependency; the system can no longer reproduce itself.

---

## 8. Replacement — *What comes after collapse*
**A new structure assumes function.**

> Power reorganizes into a different form; change occurs without restoration or moral correction.
