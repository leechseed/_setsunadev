1 Ontology (what exists / counts as real)

2 Causality (how actions make outcomes)

3 Time (how change accumulates)

4 Irreversibility / Cost (what can’t be undone)

5 Entropy (what decays if you don’t pay attention)



Layer 0 Invariant 1 — Ontology
Invariant (Locked)
A promise never kept does not exist.


Invariant 2 (Causality):
Pressure follows resistance.

Layer 0 Invariant 3 — Time / Accumulation
Invariant (Locked)
Left alone, power grows.

Layer 0 Invariant 4 — Irreversibility / Cost
Invariant (Locked)
You don’t walk away clean.

Layer 0 Invariant 5 — Entropy / Decay
Invariant (Locked)

Integrity requires maintenance.
