## 1. The Future Anchor Riley
**Role**: War Reporter / Narrative Detective.
**Status**: Investigating the "Survivors" of the Deadly Mission.
**Objective**: To reconcile her own memories of "dying" in an explosion with the official Feed record showing her and Quinn as unscathed heroes.

## 2. The Past Anchor Victoria
**Role**: High-Priority Fugitive / Terrorist Leader.
**Status**: The source of "Gnosis" (forbidden data) for Riley.
**Objective**: To clear her name and reclaim the friends lost to the "Machine" during the Racing Seasons.

## 3. The Miracle Glitch Incident
The pivotal moment in the future timeline where Quinn and Riley supposedly died in an explosion.
* **Reality**: They were destroyed.
* **Feed Record**: They survived; Quinn received the Medal of Honor.
* **The Cost**: Memories. The system has overwritten the trauma with a hero narrative.

## 4. Investigation Logic
The Racing Seasons (Movements 1-3) serve as the "Forensic Backstory" that Riley uncovers while helping Victoria in the future (Movements 4-6).
