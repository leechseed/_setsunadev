## Purpose

This document defines a **clear, staged roadmap** for moving from uncontrolled creative generation to deliberate, scalable creative production.

The goal is not to eliminate chaos, intuition, or manic creativity—but to **govern them**, so work can scale from sentences to worlds without collapsing.

---

## Phase 1 — Lock the Ground Rules

This phase establishes **non-negotiable constraints** before any serious creation begins.

### Step 1: Define Non-Negotiable Invariants

Write **exactly 3–5 invariant statements**.

These are not lore facts.  
They are **constraints on meaning**.

Each invariant must be:
- True in a single line of dialogue
- True across a character arc
- True in world history
- True even when plans fail

If an idea violates an invariant, it is removed immediately—regardless of quality or appeal.

**Deliverable:**  
`INVARIANTS.md` — a single markdown file listing only the invariants.

---

### Step 2: Declare Mode Authority

Acknowledge that you operate in multiple cognitive modes.  
The failure mode is not switching—it is **letting multiple modes hold authority at once**.

Define at minimum:
- **Muse Mode** — generates ideas
- **Architect Mode** — checks systems and scale
- **Editor Mode** — removes and refines
- **Operator Mode** — commits and ships

**Rule:**  
Only one mode has authority at any given time.

**Deliverable:**  
A short “Mode Governance Rules” section added to your knowledgebase.

---

## Phase 2 — Build the Minimum Control Surface

This phase creates just enough structure to prevent scale drift.

### Step 3: Create a Scale Spine

Do not build lore.  
Build **slots**.

Define your scale levels, for example:
- Sentence
- Scene
- Sequence
- Arc
- Season
- World

For each level, write **one governing question only**:

> How does this level enforce the invariants?

No content yet. Only structure.

**Deliverable:**  
`SCALE_SPINE.md`

---

### Step 4: Select a Test Artifact

Choose **one small artifact**, not the entire project:
- A single scene
- A short story
- A pilot episode
- A single character arc

Do not start with a universe.

**Rule:**  
If the system fails at small scale, it will collapse at large scale.

---

## Phase 3 — Run a Controlled Experiment

This phase validates the system under real conditions.

### Step 5: Execute the Governance Loop

For the test artifact, run this loop deliberately:

1. **Diverge** — Muse Mode, timed, no judgment
2. **Converge** — Editor Mode, invariants only
3. **Integrate** — Architect Mode, second-order effects
4. **Commit** — Operator Mode, lock and move on

Modes must not overlap.  
Skipping steps invalidates the test.

**Deliverable:**  
One finished artifact that survived governance.

---

### Step 6: Post-Mortem the Process

Do not critique the art.  
Critique the **process**.

Questions to answer:
- Where did chaos help?
- Where did chaos mislead?
- Which invariant did the most work?
- Which step was hardest to respect?

Adjust governance rules, not creative instincts.

---

## Phase 4 — Scale Decision Point

After one full cycle, make a single decision:

> Do I trust this system enough to scale it?

- If **yes**: apply it to the next larger unit (scene → arc, arc → season)
- If **no**: repair governance before expanding scope

Scaling without trust guarantees collapse.

---

## Hard Truths

Your primary risk is not lack of skill, intelligence, or taste.

It is **over-identification with the generative state**.

Systems thinking is not here to cage creativity.  
It exists to decide **when creativity is allowed to run wild**.

---
🔜 NEXT STEP: APPLICATION PHASE (Layer Binding)

You now need to bind the layers to real narrative artifacts.

The correct next move is:

Step 7 — Layer Binding & Validation

This is where the system becomes operational.

Step 7A — Bind Layers to a Single Test Story

Pick one of the following (only one):

A single short story

A pilot episode

A contained arc (3–5 scenes)

A known existing story you didn’t write (for testing)

Do not start with your magnum opus.

Step 7B — Create a Layer Trace Sheet (This Is Critical)

For each scene or beat, answer:

For every scene:

Layer 4:
What expression move happened?
(commit / refuse / reveal / etc.)

Layer 3:
What human experience is being expressed?
(compression, defiance, dissociation, etc.)

Layer 2 (only if applicable):
How did power respond?
(enforcement, isolation, delegation)

If you can’t answer these cleanly, the scene is mush.

Step 7C — Prove ONE Layer 5 Claim

Do not prove all eight.

Pick one dominant claim only:

Constraint

Cost

Power

Meaning

etc.

Then ask:

If this claim were false, which scenes would break?

If the answer is “none,” you’re not proving anything yet.

Step 7D — Lock the Ending (Layer 6)

Before writing the ending, explicitly choose:

Which Terminal State applies

Why the others are not possible

This prevents:

Cathartic cheating

Surprise justice

“It felt right” endings

What You Do NOT Do Next

Do not:

Add Layer 7

Add sublayers

Add meta-theory

Add aesthetics, symbols, or themes yet

Generalize to all stories

Those come after the system survives contact with reality.

The One-Sentence Next Step

Take one real story and force it to obey Layers 0–6 without exception.

If it breaks:

The story is wrong

Or a layer is wrong

Either outcome is useful.

If You Want, I Can Help With Any of These Next

Say which one and I’ll generate it exactly at your current compression level:

A printable Layer Trace Sheet (scene-by-scene)

A one-page “Is this scene valid?” checklist

A worked example using a known film or episode

A writing template that forces Layer 4–6 compliance

A failure-mode list (“If this happens, you broke X layer”)

You’re past theory now.
The system is ready to be stress-tested.
