## 1. The Geography: The Delta Coast Spiral

The world is a concentric tri-state megalopolis (Florida, Alabama, Georgia).

- **The Core (The Spaceport):** Apex of "Legibility." Where the **Bishops** rule. High-tech, total surveillance.
    
- **The Middle Bands:** Academic/Industrial sectors. Setting for "The Academy" (Movements 2 & 3).
    
- **The Outer Bands:** Lawless everglades and super-highways. Low enforcement, home to the **Fowler/Montgomery** syndicates and Movement 1.

## 2. The Reconstruction Mechanics

- **Death as Product Recall:** Fatal "Outlier" accidents are initialization points for data-acquisition.
    
- **The Reset:** A non-linear "hard-reboot" where the system overwrites traumatic death with a "Narrative Start Point" (e.g., a funeral or a medal ceremony).
    
- **Asset Nature:** Protagonists are high-performance cyborgs rebuilt to serve as political "Manchurian Candidates."

## 4. The Invariants of Power (KLK Framework)

1. **Power is Worn on the Body:** Authority is manifested as literal, visible control over physical bodies/uniforms.
    
2. **Shame is a Tool of Control:** Embarrassment is socially engineered to enforce obedience.
    
3. **Resistance Requires Self-Acceptance:** Liberation comes from owning contradiction (Hardware vs. Humanity).
    
4. **Revolution is Undignified:** Change is chaotic, obscene, and emotionally violent.

- **OS Cost:** Memories (Personal history is deleted for programming space).
    
- **MC Problem (Victoria):** Equity (The belief in fairness).
    
- **MC Solution (Victoria):** Inequity (Using her "Rigged" nature to win).
    
- **MC Critical Flaw:** Truth (Speaking truth desyncs hardware and triggers "Noise").
