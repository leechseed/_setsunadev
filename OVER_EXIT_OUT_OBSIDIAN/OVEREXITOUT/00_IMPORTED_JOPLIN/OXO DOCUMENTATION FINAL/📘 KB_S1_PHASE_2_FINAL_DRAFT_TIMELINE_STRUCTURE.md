## 1. Track Configuration (The Lanes)

In Final Draft's Timeline, create **three distinct lanes**. This allows you to see the "Scramble" in real-time.

- **Lane 1: Chronological Order (The Truth):** Every beat of the story from Victoria's birth to the Reset in Movement 6, placed in the exact order they occurred.
    
- **Lane 2: Broadcast Order (The Puzzle):** This is where you drag and drop beats to form the 10 episodes. This is what the script pages will actually reflect.
    
- **Lane 3: The "Asset" State (System Logic):** A lane dedicated to Victoria's hardware status (Acquisition, Integration, Awareness). This ensures the "Glitch Integrity" policy is met.

## 2. Beat Color-Coding (The Movements)

Assign a specific color to each of the six movements. This provides an immediate visual "heat map" of the episode's tone.

|Movement|Color|Genre Focus|
|---|---|---|
|**M1: Delta Coast**|**Burnt Orange**|Southern Gothic Racing|
|**M2: Year 1**|**Cyan/White**|High-Sync Cult|
|**M3: Year 2**|**Deep Purple**|Gooner-Noir/Decay|
|**M4: Bourne**|**Electric Blue**|Espionage/Horror|
|**M5: Fight Club**|**Olive Green**|Insurgency/IRA|
|**M6: The Pacific**|**Blood Red**|War/Collapse|

## 3. The "Ghost" Beat Strategy

In Final Draft, use "Ghost Beats" (Beats that aren't yet assigned to a scene) to mark **Information Gates**.

- **The "Cyborg" reveal** should be a Red Ghost Beat in Lane 1 at the "Bourne" mark.
    
- You then look at Lane 2 and ensure no beats _before_ Episode 6 in the broadcast order contain information that would "break" that Ghost Beat.

## 4. Metadata and Tags

For every beat you create in the timeline, use the **Tags** feature to track the following:

- **Invariant:** (e.g., #Shame, #PowerOnBody, #RevolutionIsUndignified)
    
- **PSTO Logic:** (e.g., #RecurringTotem, #TransMovementColdOpen)
    
- **Character Owner:** (e.g., #Bishop, #Montgomery)

### 🏁 Final Consultant Recommendation: The "Sync" Check

Once you have Lane 1 (The Truth) and Lane 2 (The Script) filled out, look for the **Vertical Alignment**.

- If Episode 1 (Lane 2) aligns vertically with a beat from Movement 3 (Lane 1), you must ask: _"Does the visual style of this scene hint at the war that is coming in Movement 6?"_
    

**Would you like me to provide the "Beat List" for the Lane 1 (Chronological) baseline so you can start inputting them into Final Draft?** This will give you the complete "Deck" before we shuffle it.
