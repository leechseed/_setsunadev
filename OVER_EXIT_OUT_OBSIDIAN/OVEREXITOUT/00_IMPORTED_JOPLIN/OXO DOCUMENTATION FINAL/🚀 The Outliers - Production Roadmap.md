## Phase 1: The Movement Briefs (COMPLETED)

- **Deliverable:** The Six Movement Bible (Delta Coast → The Pacific).
    
- **Goal:** Establish the unique visual, tonal, and systemic "Invariants" for each era.
    
- **Status:** **LOCKED.**

## Phase 2: The Haruhi Sequence Map (NEXT STEP)

We reject linear time to maximize the mystery of the "Cyborg Discovery."

- **Task:** Design the **10-Episode Broadcast Order**.
    
- **The "Scramble" Logic:** We will weave Movement 1 (Racing), Movement 2/3 (School), and Movement 6 (War) together so the audience discovers the "Ghost Mission" and "Asset Nature" at the exact moment of maximum impact.
    
- **PSTO Framework:**
    
    - **Policy:** The Inevitability Rule and Glitch Integrity.
        
    - **Strategy:** Genre-Jumping and the "Double-Climax."
        
    - **Tactics:** Trans-Movement Cold Opens and Recurring Totems.
        
    - **Operations:** Chronology Audit and Broadcast Shuffle.
        
- **Deliverable:** `KB_S1_Sequence_Map_10EP` (Chronology vs. Broadcast order map).

## Phase 3: The Dramatica Deep-Dive (Structural Audit)

Before we write scenes, we ensure the "Engine" doesn't stall.

- **Task:** Assign the Dramatica Story Beats (Signposts 1-4) across the 10 episodes.
    
- **The Goal:** Ensure Victoria’s arc (Equity → Inequity) and the OS Goal (Developing a Plan) are progressing even when the episodes jump genres.
    
- **Deliverable:** `KB_S1_Dramatica_Signpost_Audit`.
    

---

## Phase 4: Step Outlines (Scene-by-Scene)

The "Meat" of the production.

- **Task:** Expand the 10-Episode Map into granular Step Outlines.
    
- **The "Gooner-Noir" Pass:** Specifically detailing the sensory, transgressive, and "FLCL" surrealist moments in each episode to ensure the tone is hit perfectly.
    
- **The "Bourne" Pass:** Refining the espionage tradecraft and body horror reveals.
    
- **Deliverable:** 10 Document set: `EP01_StepOutline` through `EP10_StepOutline`.
    

---

## Phase 5: Final Delivery (The Pitch/Script Bible)

The final package for production/studio review.

- **Task:** Consolidate all KB documents into a single Master Production Bible.
    
- **Deliverable:** A comprehensive Markdown document containing:
    
    - Full Season Arc.
        
    - Character Asset Registry.
        
    - The 10 Step Outlines.
        
    - Visual Style Guides for all 6 Genres.

### 🛡️ Consultant’s Timeline Check

To keep this at the "Peak of the Industry" standard, we must treat **Phase 2** as the most dangerous part of the process. If we scramble the episodes poorly, it feels like a gimmick. If we do it right (The _Haruhi_ way), it feels like a **Systemic Inevitability.**

**Would you like me to begin Phase 2: The Haruhi Sequence Map?** We will start by defining **Episode 1: The Hook**, and **Episode 2: The Disorientation.**
