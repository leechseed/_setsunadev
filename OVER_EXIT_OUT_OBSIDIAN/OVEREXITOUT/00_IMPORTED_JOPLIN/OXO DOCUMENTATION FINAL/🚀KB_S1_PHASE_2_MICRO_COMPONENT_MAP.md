## Component 2A: The Chronology Audit (Raw Data)

This is the process of defining every single physical event in Victoria's life from start to finish, regardless of when the audience sees it. We break this down by Movement:

- **Task 2A.1**: Define every beat of Movement 1 (Purple - Racing).
    
- **Task 2A.2**: Define every beat of Movement 2 (Blue - Year 1).
    
- **Task 2A.3**: Define every beat of Movement 3 (Green - Year 2).
    
- **Task 2A.4**: Define every beat of Movement 4 (Yellow - Awakening).
    
- **Task 2A.5**: Define every beat of Movement 5 (Orange - Insurgency).
    
- **Task 2A.6**: Define every beat of Movement 6 (Red - The War).
    

## Component 2B: The Frame Architecture (The Future View)

This defines the "Physical Reality" of Quinn and Riley in the "Future" (M6).

- **Task 2B.1**: Define the "Miracle Glitch" (The Explosion Event).
    
- **Task 2B.2**: Define the "Feed Interface" (How Riley accesses the data).
    
- **Task 2B.3**: Define Quinn’s specific "Administrative Filter" actions in the future.
    

## Component 2C: The Information Gating (The Secrets)

Before we shuffle, we must decide what the audience _cannot_ know at specific times.

- **Task 2C.1**: The "Identity" Gate (When do we know Victoria = Tori?).
    
- **Task 2C.2**: The "Hardware" Gate (When do we see the fiber-optics?).
    
- **Task 2C.3**: The "Betrayal" Gate (When do we see the Brother's involvement?).
    

## Component 2D: The Scramble Matrix (The 12-EP Grid)

The actual math of placing beats into episodes.

- **Task 2D.1**: Map Act 1 (Episodes 1-4).
    
- **Task 2D.2**: Map Act 2 (Episodes 5-8).
    
- **Task 2D.3**: Map Act 3 (Episodes 9-12).
    

## Component 2E: The Final Draft Tooling (Infrastructure)

Setting up the file so it can handle this complexity.

- **Task 2E.1**: Labeling the 3 Outline Tracks.
    
- **Task 2E.2**: Mapping the Beat Board Columns.

### 🛑 CURRENT ACTION POINT: Task 2A.1 (Movement 1 - Purple)

We are starting at the very beginning of the "Truth." I will list the proposed beats for **Movement 1: Delta Coast (Purple)**. You tell me if these are the correct "Micro-Steps" for this movement.

**Movement 1: The Raw Chronology (Purple/Racing)**

1. **The Pace Note Ritual**: Victoria and her brother prep for a run. Establish the "Human/Tactile" bond.
    
2. **The "Legible" Win**: Victoria wins a race so cleanly that she draws the attention of the Racing Guild (The Bishops).
    
3. **The "Fowler" Ultimatum**: The Syndicate/Guild demands Victoria "throw" her next race to maintain the "Feed's" narrative.
    
4. **The Refusal**: Victoria decides to race for real, defying the System's "Legibility" requirements.
    
5. **The Rigged Crash**: The System (Quinn/Anna) ensures Victoria's car fails at high speed. The "Fatal" Fire.
    
6. **The Salvage**: Montgomery (The Bishop rival) recovers Victoria's "Residue" (body) from the wreckage.
    

**Do you confirm these 6 beats for Task 2A.1?** If yes, we move to 2A.2. If no, we adjust these 6 beats until you say "Confirm." No other movement, no other phase. Just this.
