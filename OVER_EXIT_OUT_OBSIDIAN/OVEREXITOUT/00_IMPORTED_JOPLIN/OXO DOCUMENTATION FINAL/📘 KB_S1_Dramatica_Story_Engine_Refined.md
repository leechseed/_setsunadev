# KB_S1_Dramatica_Story_Engine_Refined

This document codifies the psychological drivers of the series based on the Dramatica formula.

---

## 📑 Structural Dynamics
* **Driver**: Decision (Every turn is a choice made by Authority or Tori).
* **Limit**: Optionlock (Tori runs out of legal/social ways to remain legitimate).
* **Outcome**: Failure (The Administration successfully archives/erases Victoria).
* **Judgement**: Good (Victoria finds internal Meaning and Integrity despite her loss).

## 📑 Throughlines
* **OS Throughline**: Manipulation (The Feed/Administration altering reality).
* **OS Goal**: Developing a Plan (The cover-up vs. The investigation).
* **OS Cost**: Memories (The deletion/overwriting of personal and public history).

## 📑 The Protagonist Conflict
* **MC Problem**: Equity (Tori's demand for fairness).
* **MC Solution**: Inequity (Accepting the world is imbalanced to survive it).
* **MC Critical Flaw**: Truth.
* **The Logic**: In a system of **Legibility**, the Truth creates "Noise." Speaking the Truth is the specific action that triggers the **Ban**.
