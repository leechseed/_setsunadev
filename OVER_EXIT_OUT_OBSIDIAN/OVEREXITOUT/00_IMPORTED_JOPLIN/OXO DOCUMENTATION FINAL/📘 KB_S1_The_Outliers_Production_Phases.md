## 1. Phase 1 The Movement Briefs (Style and Logic)

Before writing individual episodes, we define the "Physical Laws" of the six genre movements. Since each episode is an anthology-style block, the **Administration** and **The Feed** must behave differently in each.

- **Task**: Create 6 "Style Guides" defining Visual Language, Invariant Focus, and the Feed's role.
    
- **Invariant Focus**:
    
    - _Racing Drama_: Legibility (Fame).
        
    - _Jason Bourne_: The Ban (Survival).
        
    - _The Pacific_: Collapse (War).
        
- **Output**: `KB_S1_Phase1_Movement_Briefs`
    

## 2. Phase 2 The 10 Episode Sequence Map (The Haruhi Logic)

This is where we determine the **Broadcast Order**. We reject linear chronology to maximize the "Techno-Thriller" mystery.

- **The Mapping Logic**:
    
    - **Episode 1**: The Hook (Establishing the Racing World).
        
    - **Episode 2**: The Disorientation (Jumping to the War Future).
        
    - **Episodes 3-9**: The Investigation (Piecing together the "Ban" and the "Explosion").
        
    - **Episode 10**: The Resolution (The Failure/Good outcome).
        
- **Output**: `KB_S1_Sequence_Map_10EP`
    

## 3. Phase 3 The Script Ready Step Outlines

The final "Deep Dive." This takes the sequence map and expands each episode into a scene-by-scene breakdown.

- **The Collision Matrix**: Every scene is audited for:
    
    - **Protagonist Goal**: (The "Do-er" action).
        
    - **Systemic Resistance**: (The Invariant blocking them).
        
    - **Tethering**: (Connecting this scene to a different time-period).
        
- **Final Deliverable**: 10 "Step Outlines" (2-4 pages each) ready for dialogue and screenplay formatting.
