## 1. The Story Engine Dynamics

The following dynamics govern the "pacing" and "inevitability" of the season.

- **Driver: Decision**: Every major turn in the plot is caused by a choice made by an authority (The Administration) or an individual (Tori), rather than by random actions or accidents.
    
- **Limit: Optionlock**: The conflict escalates not because time is running out, but because Tori is running out of ways to remain "Legible" to the system. One by one, her exits are closed.
    
- **Outcome: Failure**: Tori will fail to "Developing a Plan" that restores her status. The Administration's erasure of her will be complete.
    
- **Judgement: Good**: Despite losing everything, Tori’s "Resolve: Change" leads to a state of personal peace or moral victory. She finds **Meaning** in the wreckage.
