# 📘 Layer 3 — Writer-Facing Violation Checklist  
## Human Interface Integrity Audit

> Use this checklist during outlining, drafting, or revision.  
> If any item triggers **YES**, review the scene or arc for Layer 3 violations.

---
---


## A. System Override Detection  
**(Layer 3 must never overpower Layers 0–2)**

- ☐ Does a character’s emotional breakthrough *halt*, *delay*, or *soften* enforcement?
- ☐ Does psychological insight directly change institutional behavior?
- ☐ Does trauma, suffering, or endurance grant new systemic access or protection?
- ☐ Does a personal realization function as a causal lever in the plot?

**If YES** → Layer 3 is overriding system mechanics.

---

## B. Specialness Leak  
**(No character is exempt by depth, pain, or sincerity)**

- ☐ Is a character treated as immune to isolation, erasure, or accumulation?
- ☐ Does the narrative imply this character “matters more” to the system?
- ☐ Are consequences suspended because the character is exceptional, chosen, or uniquely aware?
- ☐ Would the same outcome occur if a less-developed character made the same choice?

**If YES** → Protagonist exceptionalism has breached the layer boundary.

---

## C. Meaning → Effect Slippage  
**(Meaning must not equal leverage)**

- ☐ Does inner coherence produce external success?
- ☐ Is healing rewarded with influence, safety, or legitimacy?
- ☐ Does acceptance, forgiveness, or love restore circulation or relevance?
- ☐ Is “understanding” treated as a form of power?

**If YES** → Meaning is being smuggled in as force.

---

## D. Expression Misuse  
**(Expressions explain behavior, not outcomes)**

- ☐ Is an expression framed as “the right way” to survive the system?
- ☐ Do characters who adopt a specific expression outperform others?
- ☐ Is an expression treated as a strategy rather than a coping shape?
- ☐ Does the story imply moral superiority yields structural advantage?

**If YES** → Expressions are being promoted to mechanics.

---

## E. Resistance Sanitization  
**(Resistance reveals power; it does not erase it)**

- ☐ Does resistance reduce pressure instead of increasing or exposing it?
- ☐ Is opposition rewarded simply for existing?
- ☐ Does truth-telling interrupt enforcement?
- ☐ Does defiance succeed without cost, residue, or isolation?

**If YES** → Layer 2 constraints are being violated via Layer 3.

---

## F. Withdrawal Illusion  
**(Disengagement is not escape)**

- ☐ Does withdrawal protect a character from consequences?
- ☐ Is opting out framed as safety rather than exposure?
- ☐ Does absence function as resistance rather than forfeiture?
- ☐ Is isolation portrayed as freedom without loss?

**If YES** → Punishment Logic is being bypassed.

---

## G. Emotional Resolution Fallacy  
**(Closure ≠ victory)**

- ☐ Does emotional resolution coincide with systemic resolution?
- ☐ Is “letting go” treated as a way out of enforcement?
- ☐ Does narrative closure imply stability or safety going forward?
- ☐ Are loose ends tied because the character has made peace?

**If YES** → Layer 3 has been mistaken for an ending.

---

## H. Final Sanity Check  
**(The One Question That Catches Almost Everything)**

- ☐ If this scene were stripped of the character’s internal experience, would the system behave the same way?

**If NO** → Layer 3 has illegally influenced system behavior.

---

## Pass Condition

A scene **passes** Layer 3 integrity if:
- The system behaves identically regardless of inner experience.
- Emotional truth deepens cost, not outcome.
- Expressions stabilize characters without granting leverage.

---

## Usage Tip

Run this checklist:
- Once at outline
- Once at midpoint
- Once during final revision

Layer 3 violations compound quietly.  
Early detection preserves the entire stack.
