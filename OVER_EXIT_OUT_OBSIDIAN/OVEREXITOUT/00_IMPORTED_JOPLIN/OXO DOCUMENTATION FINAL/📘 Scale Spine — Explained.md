## Purpose

The Scale Spine defines the **minimum structural control surface** required to prevent scale drift in this IP.

It exists to ensure that narrative meaning remains coherent as work scales from individual lines to an entire world.

This document does not prescribe content.  
It defines **structural obligations**.

---

## What the Scale Spine Is

The Scale Spine is a **hierarchy of narrative scales**, each with a single governing question.

Each question exists to:
- enforce the narrative invariants
- prevent decorative expansion
- expose illegitimate coherence
- eliminate false progress

The Scale Spine does not generate story.  
It **filters** story.

---

## Relationship to Narrative Invariants

Narrative Invariants define what must always be true.

The Scale Spine defines **where and how those truths must be enforced**.

Every scale level is an enforcement surface.  
Failure at any level constitutes a system failure, not a local flaw.

No scale is exempt.

---

## Scale Levels and Governing Questions

### Sentence

> **What invariant pressure does this line exert or reveal?**

A sentence that does not apply pressure is decorative and should be removed.

---

### Scene

> **Which invariant is violated, paid for, or enforced in this scene?**

A scene must transact with an invariant to justify its existence.

---

### Sequence

> **How do these scenes compound cost, exposure, or narrative liability?**

Sequences exist to escalate consequence, not to provide variation.

---

### Arc

> **How does this arc demonstrate systemic survival through human loss or deformation?**

Arcs resolve institutional tension, not personal comfort.

---

### Season

> **How does the system normalize, absorb, or retaliate after disruption?**

Seasons track institutional counter-moves, not protagonist progression.

---

### World

> **How does the setting enforce the invariants without protagonists?**

The world must function as an invariant engine independently of heroes.

---

## Enforcement Rules

- Each scale level must independently satisfy its governing question.
- Success at one scale does not excuse failure at another.
- Decorative coherence is not coherence.
- If a piece of work cannot be placed cleanly on the spine, it is invalid.

---

## Common Failure Modes

- Treating the Scale Spine as thematic guidance instead of enforcement law
- Allowing higher-scale success to justify lower-scale violations
- Using variety or spectacle as a substitute for consequence
- Letting protagonists become load-bearing for the world
- Confusing escalation with expansion

---

## Usage Guidance

- Apply the Scale Spine during **Architect Mode**.
- Use it as a kill-filter during **Editor Mode**.
- Never consult it during **Muse Mode**.
- Defer to it during **Operator Mode** when locking canon.

The Scale Spine exists to reduce debate, not to inspire discussion.

---

## Summary

The Scale Spine is a **narrative governance mechanism**.

It ensures that:
- meaning scales cleanly
- systems remain dominant
- characters pay real cost
- identity remains unstable
- the world enforces truth without exception

If the Scale Spine is obeyed, drift is impossible.
