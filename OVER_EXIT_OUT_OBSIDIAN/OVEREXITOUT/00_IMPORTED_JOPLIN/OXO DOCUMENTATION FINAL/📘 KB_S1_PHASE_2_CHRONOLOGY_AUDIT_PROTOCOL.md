## 1. The Linear Baseline (The "True" Timeline)

We must first list the **Major Beats** of Victoria's life in the order they actually happened. This is the "internal" logic of the world that the audience won't see clearly until the end.
wwww
- **Point Alpha (M1):** The "Southern Gothic" era. The racing, the relationship with her brother, and the **Fatal Crash**.
    
- **Point Beta (M2/M3):** The "Academy" years. Indoctrination, the "Sync-Cult" rituals, and the descent into the "Gooner-Noir" rot.
    
- **Point Gamma (M4):** The "Awakening." The realization of being an Asset and the subsequent escape.
    
- **Point Delta (M5/M6):** The "Insurgency" and the "Total War." The Fight Club era leading to the Ghost Mission and the **Second Reset**.

## 2. The Anchors (Information Gates)

We need to decide what information is "Gated."

- **The "Brother" Gate:** In M1, we see him as a ghost/memory. In M6, we reveal he was a Bishop Asset the whole time.
    
- **The "Hardware" Gate:** We need to find the exact moments in Year 1 (M2) where Victoria's hardware "glitches" but is dismissed as puberty/stress.
    

## 3. The "Glitch" Identification

We will identify "Visual Glitches" that serve as connective tissue between movements.

- **Example:** A specific visual distortion that appears when Victoria is racing (M1) is the _exact same_ distortion that appears when she is being "Tuned" in the Gooner-Noir phase (M3). This tells the audience: _These two events are connected by the system._

## 4. Immediate Next Step

We are going to define the **Episode 1 Blueprint**.

To make the "Haruhi" method work, **Episode 1** must be a "Double-Entry" point. It needs to establish the "Present" and the "Past" simultaneously to hook the viewer into the puzzle.

**Would you like me to draft the "Double-Entry" map for Episode 1?** This will involve:

1. **Scene A (M1):** The high-stakes Race (The Hook).
    
2. **Scene B (M3):** The sensory rot of the Academy (The Mystery).
    
3. **The Bridge:** How we transition between them using a **Recurring Totem**.
