# 📘 Layer 1  Value & Meaning Logic
---


## 1. Reward Logic — *What the system rewards*
**The system rewards inputs, not beliefs.**

> Only actions that enter the system are legible. Intent, sincerity, and conviction have no weight unless enacted.

---

## 2. Punishment Logic — *What the system punishes*
**The system punishes withdrawal by letting it fail.**

> Disengagement is permitted but unsupported; absence forfeits protection and allows failure to proceed unmitigated.

---

## 3. Ignorance Logic — *What the system ignores*
**The system ignores suffering.**

> Pain and loss do not register unless they alter outcomes; endurance alone carries no moral or systemic claim.
