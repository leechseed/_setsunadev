## Purpose of the Scale × Ontology Framework

This framework defines **which ontological layers are legitimately active at each narrative scale**.

It exists to:
- Prevent premature rule exposure  
- Stop higher-scale logic leaking into lower-scale moments  
- Provide a mechanical way to debug narrative incoherence  
- Preserve invariant integrity while scaling scope  

Scaling answers *how far consequences spread*.  
Ontology answers *which truths are allowed to operate*.

## Core Principle: Scaling vs Ontology

> **Scaling increases consequence radius.  
Ontology determines which constraints may speak.**

- Scale is **horizontal** (reach across time, people, systems)
- Ontology is **vertical** (authority of truth)

Scaling never introduces new ontology.  
It only **activates deeper layers of already-defined constraint**.

## Ontology Layer Summary

| Layer | Name | Governs |
|----|----|----|
| **L0** | Ontological Reality | Existence, time, causality, irreversibility |
| **L1** | Value & Meaning Logic | What matters, moral consequence |
| **L2** | Power & Systemic Force | Who can decide, who enforces |
| **L3** | Human Interface | How rules are experienced by people |
| **L4** | Expression Mechanics | How pressure moves moment to moment |
| **L5** | Structural Argument | How the story proves its claim |
| **L6** | Delivery & Perception | How meaning is framed for the audience |

Lower layers constrain higher layers absolutely.

## Narrative Scale Summary

| Scale | Functional Unit |
|----|----|
| **Sentence** | Pressure |
| **Beat** | Change |
| **Scene** | Conflict |
| **Episode** | Inquiry |
| **Arc** | Transformation |
| **Season** | Argument |
| **World** | Permanence |

Each scale widens consequence radius without changing truth.

## Scale × Ontology Interaction Matrix

**Legend**
- ✅ = Actively enforced  
- ⚠️ = Implicit / indirect  
- ❌ = Must not appear  

| Scale ↓ / Layer → | L0 Reality | L1 Meaning | L2 Power | L3 Interface | L4 Expression | L5 Argument | L6 Perception |
|------------------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Sentence** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ |

This table defines **what is allowed to operate**, not what must be explicit.

## Scale Unit Elaborations

### **Sentence**
**Scale Function:** Unit of pressure

A sentence is the smallest vehicle by which constraint is felt.

- **Active Layers:** L3, L4 (L6 indirectly)
- **Must Do:** transmit intent, risk, leverage, tone
- **Must Not:** explain the world, state theme, resolve conflict

**Diagnostic:**  
> If the sentence can be removed without changing pressure, it failed its scale.

---

### **Beat**
**Scale Function:** Unit of change

A beat marks a before/after difference in understanding or intent.

- **Active Layers:** L3, L4 (L1 implicitly)
- **Must Do:** force adjustment, alter momentum
- **Must Not:** stall motion, reset state, add rules

**Diagnostic:**  
> If nothing is different afterward, the beat does not exist.

---

### **Scene**
**Scale Function:** Unit of conflict

A scene is a closed system of opposition with cost.

- **Active Layers:** L2, L3, L4 (L1 pressured)
- **Must Do:** pit incompatible goals, extract payment
- **Must Not:** introduce world logic, end cleanly

**Diagnostic:**  
> If no one paid something, the scene was decorative.

---

### **Episode**
**Scale Function:** Unit of inquiry

An episode pressures one belief or assumption across scenes.

- **Active Layers:** L1, L2, L3, L4 (L5 implicit)
- **Must Do:** reveal patterns, propagate consequence
- **Must Not:** reset status quo, deliver final judgment

**Diagnostic:**  
> If you can’t name the belief being tested, it’s filler.

---

### **Arc**
**Scale Function:** Unit of transformation

An arc tracks irreversible change over time.

- **Active Layers:** L1, L2, L3, L5
- **Must Do:** close options, deform identity or systems
- **Must Not:** allow cost-free growth, undo damage

**Diagnostic:**  
> If everything is still possible at the end, no arc occurred.

---

### **Season**
**Scale Function:** Unit of argument

A season argues how the world actually works.

- **Active Layers:** L0, L1, L2, L5
- **Must Do:** stress-test a claim, clarify what wins
- **Must Not:** change rules, rely on character exceptions

**Diagnostic:**  
> If the season can’t be summarized as an argument, it drifted.

---

### **World**
**Scale Function:** Unit of permanence

The world encodes truth independent of story presence.

- **Active Layers:** All (dominated by L0 and L2)
- **Must Do:** accumulate history, enforce systems without heroes
- **Must Not:** bend rules, forget consequence

**Diagnostic:**  
> If rules fail when characters exit, it’s a stage—not a world.

---

## Rules of Interaction

1. Lower layers constrain higher layers  
2. Higher layers express, never override  
3. Scaling widens reach; it never invents truth  
4. Violations propagate upward and destabilize coherence  

---

## Common Scale–Ontology Violations

- Theme stated in dialogue → L1 leaked into Sentence  
- Hero fixes system → L3 overrode L2  
- Lore dump mid-scene → L0 injected too early  
- Reset episode → L5 ignored  
- Retcon ending → L0 violated  

Most narrative failures reduce to one of these.

---

## Practical Usage

### Drafting
- Identify current scale
- Restrict yourself to allowed layers
- Treat forbidden layers as off-limits

### Revision
- When something feels wrong, locate the scale
- Identify the layer intrusion
- Remove, defer, or relocate the violating element

### Design
- Lock ontology first
- Design scaling second
- Let characters express, never define

---

## Final Compression Rule

> **Scale decides how far meaning travels.  
Ontology decides how much truth is allowed to speak.**

Lock both, and narrative coherence survives indefinitely.
