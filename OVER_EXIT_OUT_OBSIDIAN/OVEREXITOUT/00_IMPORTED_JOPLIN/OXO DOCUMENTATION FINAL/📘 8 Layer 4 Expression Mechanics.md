# 📘 Layer 4 — Expression Mechanics
---

## 1. Commit — *How possibility becomes obligation*
**Choice hardens into responsibility.**

> An action is taken that cannot be undone without consequence; future options narrow and residue remains.

---

## 2. Refuse — *How cooperation is denied*
**Consent is withdrawn without replacement.**

> Participation stops. Risk and burden are pushed outward, forcing pressure to reroute or escalate.

---

## 3. Reveal — *How information creates exposure*
**Knowledge surfaces at a cost.**

> Information becomes legible, redistributing threat and vulnerability—often to the benefit of existing power.

---

## 4. Delay — *How time becomes pressure*
**Waiting makes outcomes worse.**

> Resolution is deferred; options decay as accumulation favors whoever already holds advantage.

---

## 5. Escalate — *How stakes are raised*
**Conflict expands when blocked.**

> Consequences intensify, exits narrow, and loss becomes more expensive.

---

## 6. Isolate — *How impact is neutralized*
**Circulation is cut off.**

> A subject may survive, but reach, relevance, and effect are severed.

---

## 7. Transfer Risk — *How danger moves without stopping*
**Consequences are displaced.**

> Blame, exposure, or harm shifts to another carrier while outcomes persist.

---

## 8. Close — *How options end*
**Paths are permanently foreclosed.**

> A future choice is eliminated entirely; recovery is no longer possible without loss.
