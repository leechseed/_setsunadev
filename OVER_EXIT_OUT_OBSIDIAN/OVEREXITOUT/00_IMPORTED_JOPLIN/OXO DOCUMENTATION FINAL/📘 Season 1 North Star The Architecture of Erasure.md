## 1. The Season Claim

**"The system only protects what it can categorize."**

In Season 1, power is not exercised through violence, but through **classification**. To be "safe" is to be legible to the system's sensors. To be "erased" is to have one's category revoked.

The season is a demonstration of how the **Ecclesial** and **Guild** apparatuses maintain order by narrowing the definition of a "person" until the protagonists no longer fit the criteria.

## 2. The Series Epitaph

This is the literal "North Star" sentence that the season's structure exists to prove. It is spoken from the perspective of the system’s enforcers (likely Quinn Bishop) to the "human residue" (Victoria Midnight).

> **"We don't have to put you in a cell. We just have to make you un-detectable. Once the Feed bans the name 'Midnight,' you aren't a person anymore. You're just noise."**

## 3. The Primary Interface: The Feed

**The Feed** is the narrative's manifestation of the **Ecclesial Apparatus (Grace)**.

- It is the "Social Record" that confers legitimacy.
    
- **Verification** is the modern sacrament.
    
- **Banning** is the modern excommunication.
    
- **The Algorithm** is the mechanical law that dictates who is "seen" and who is "invisible."

## 4. Structural Mechanics of the 'Ban'

The "Ban" is the primary weapon used against Victoria and Riley. It functions as a **Terminal State** at the social scale.

- **Non-Physical Containment**: The system does not need to imprison the body if it can disconnect the body from the infrastructure of survival (banking, transport, communication).
    
- **Identity as a Credential**: Identity is not something a character _has_; it is a credential the system _issues_. When the credential is "Banned," the character's lived truth (what happened on the track) is rendered systemically irrelevant.

## 5. The 'Noise' Constraint

In this IP, characters who are "Banned" become **Noise**.

- **Noise** is information that the system is programmed to ignore or filter out.
    
- When Victoria tries to speak the truth, it is processed by the public (The Feed) not as "Evidence," but as "Spam" or "Glitch."
    
- The tragedy of Season 1 is the protagonist's realization that **being right doesn't matter if you are filtered.**

## 6. Operational Veto Rules

To maintain the integrity of this North Star, the following narrative turns are **strictly prohibited**:

1. **The Truth-is-Enough Veto**: Victoria cannot "reveal the truth" and have the Ban lifted. The Ban is a procedural response to her existence, not a mistake about the facts.
    
2. **The Heroic Recognition Veto**: Strangers cannot recognize Victoria from "The Feed" once she is banned. If she isn't in the signal, she doesn't exist in the public's consciousness.
    
3. **The Reset Veto**: No character can "start over" with a clean slate. Once you are "Noise," the system’s "Archive" remembers the error, even if it ignores the person.
