## 1. The Geography: The Delta Coast Spiral

The world is a concentric "Spiral" spanning Florida, Alabama, and Georgia.

- **The Core**: The Spaceport. The apex of "Legibility." Where the **Bishops** rule.
    
- **The Middle Bands**: The Academy and Industrial Sectors.
    
- **The Outer Bands**: The "Wild West." Lawless everglades and super-highways. Where the **Fowlers** and **Montgomerys** operate.

## 2. The Reconstruction Logic: Death as a Product Recall

In _The Outliers_, death is not an end; it is a **Boot Sequence**.

- **The Initialization**: When a high-value "Outlier" (Victoria, Quinn, Riley) dies in a catastrophic event, they are acquired by a Faction.
    
- **The Reset**: A "hard-reboot" of the asset where the system overwrites the traumatic memory with a "System-Approved" reality (a funeral, a ceremony).
    
- **The Reveal**: Characters believe they are human until **Movement 4 (Bourne)**, where the hardware becomes undeniable.

## 3. Movement 1: The Outer Band (Racing/Southern Gothic)

- **Vibe**: _Outlaw Racing / Red Dead Redemption 2 / Nitro-Cross._
    
- **The Story**: Victoria Midnight, a driver for a criminal syndicate, ignores her brother’s pace-notes during a high-speed rally.
    
- **The Crash**: The car explodes. Victoria "wakes up" at her brother's funeral.
    
- **Invariant Focus**: **Meaning**. Victoria's grief is real; the System's "Reset" is the first lie.

## 4. Movement 2: Year 1 Academy (The Sync Cult)

- **Vibe**: _The Social Network / The Wave / FLCL._
    
- **The Story**: Victoria is recruited into the "Inner Spiral" Academy.
    
- **The Mechanics**: The school is a "Sync Cult." Students are ranked by how well they mirror the Bishop Faction's ideals.
    
- **The FLCL Element**: Victoria’s grief and hardware manifest as surreal, explosive physical outbursts—mechanical "horns" or "Vespa-sized" data glitches—treated as "Digital Puberty."

## 5. Movement 3: Year 2 Academy (The Transgressive Decay)

- **Vibe**: _Spring Breakers / Dragon Tattoo / Black Swan / Dark Gooner-Bait._
    
- **The Story**: The "Clean" Academy rots into a sensory nightmare.
    
- **The Mechanics**: Sexuality and drugs (V-Sync) become the primary tools of control.
    
- **The Gooner Aesthetic**: Students are kept in "V-Sync" trances (edging on a hardware crash) to make them compliant.
    
- **The Forensics**: Victoria (Dragon Tattoo style) uses the transgressive underground to find the deleted data of her brother's death.

## 6. The Invariants of Power (The KLK Framework)

The series adheres to the radical structural constraints of _Kill la Kill_:

1. **Power is Worn on the Body**: Rank is displayed on uniforms; less clothing = more biometric data-transparency.
    
2. **Shame is a Tool of Control**: The Administration uses public social "Desyncs" and sexual blackmail to enforce obedience.
    
3. **Resistance Requires Self-Acceptance**: Victoria wins by embracing her "messy" hardware rather than trying to be "clean."
    
4. **Revolution is Undignified**: The break from the Academy in Movement 4 is chaotic, obscene, and violent.
