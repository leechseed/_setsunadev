## 1. The Future Profile (The Green Beret)
* **Archetype**: Guardian (Dramatica).
* **Status**: Decorated Hero / Medal of Honor recipient.
* **The Secret**: He is a "Living Lie." The explosion in the future was fatal; his "Hero" status is a curated Feed fabrication.

## 2. The Past Profile (The Janitor)
* **Archetype**: Reason (Dramatica).
* **Status**: High-level Administrative Fixer for the Racing Guild.
* **Operational Mode**: He executes the "Ban" not out of malice, but out of a logical need to keep the Feed "Legible."

## 3. The Riley Link
Quinn and Riley share a "Memory Cost." Riley is the only witness to Quinn's "death," making her a high-priority threat to his Legibility.
