## 🧭 Mode Governance Rules

---
---


## Purpose

This section defines **mode authority** for creative work in this IP.

The problem is not switching cognitive modes.  
The problem is **allowing more than one mode to hold authority at the same time**.

Mode overlap produces:
- incoherent decisions
- scale drift
- revision paralysis
- rule-of-cool violations
- erosion of invariants

This system exists to prevent that failure.

---

## Core Rule (Non-Negotiable)

> **Only one mode has authority at any given time.**

All other modes are silent observers.

If authority is unclear, **no work is valid** until authority is declared.

---

## The Four Modes

---

### 🎭 Muse Mode — Generation Authority

**Function:**  
Produce raw material.

Muse Mode is responsible for:
- ideas
- images
- dialogue fragments
- scenes
- emotional impulses
- transgressive notions
- “what if” thinking

**Permissions**
- May contradict invariants (temporarily)
- May be incoherent
- May generate excess
- May follow intuition over structure

**Prohibitions**
- May NOT decide what stays
- May NOT judge quality
- May NOT finalize anything
- May NOT defend its output

**Failure Mode**
- Treating inspiration as entitlement
- Falling in love with first drafts

Muse Mode creates *fuel*, not canon.

---

### 🧠 Architect Mode — Structural Authority

**Function:**  
Evaluate system coherence and scale.

Architect Mode is responsible for:
- enforcing narrative invariants
- checking second-order consequences
- ensuring scale consistency (scene → world)
- validating system interactions (power, institutions, history)

**Permissions**
- May reject ideas regardless of “cool”
- May restructure or relocate material
- May demand additional cost or consequence

**Prohibitions**
- May NOT generate new content
- May NOT polish language
- May NOT make emotional arguments

**Failure Mode**
- Over-theorizing
- Expanding scope instead of constraining it

Architect Mode answers one question:
> *Does this survive contact with the system?*

---

### ✂️ Editor Mode — Refinement Authority

**Function:**  
Remove, compress, and sharpen.

Editor Mode is responsible for:
- cutting excess
- tightening language
- clarifying intent
- enforcing tone discipline
- eliminating redundancy

**Permissions**
- May delete without replacement
- May simplify aggressively
- May rewrite for clarity

**Prohibitions**
- May NOT add new ideas
- May NOT alter invariant meaning
- May NOT expand scope

**Failure Mode**
- Perfectionism
- Endless revision
- Cosmetic tinkering

Editor Mode exists to make the work *legible*, not clever.

---

### 🚀 Operator Mode — Commitment Authority

**Function:**  
Lock decisions and move forward.

Operator Mode is responsible for:
- declaring canon
- freezing documents
- shipping artifacts
- advancing to the next stage of work

**Permissions**
- May finalize imperfect work
- May declare “good enough”
- May enforce deadlines
- May close discussion

**Prohibitions**
- May NOT reopen settled decisions
- May NOT solicit new ideas
- May NOT re-litigate invariants

**Failure Mode**
- Avoidance of commitment
- Indefinite postponement

Operator Mode protects momentum.

---

## Mode Transition Rules

- Mode transitions must be **explicit**.
- Authority must be declared before work begins.
- Authority must be relinquished before switching.

**Example declarations**
- “Entering Muse Mode for 30 minutes.”
- “Switching to Architect Mode for invariant check.”
- “Editor Mode only. No new content.”
- “Operator Mode: locking and moving on.”

Implicit mode switching invalidates the session.

---

## Conflict Resolution Rule

When modes disagree:

- Muse defers to Architect
- Architect defers to Invariants
- Editor defers to Architect
- Operator defers to Schedule, not preference

No mode overrules the invariants.

---

## Relationship to Narrative Invariants

- **Muse Mode** is allowed to violate invariants temporarily.
- **Architect Mode** exists to enforce invariants absolutely.
- **Editor Mode** clarifies invariant expression.
- **Operator Mode** locks invariant-compliant outcomes into canon.

If invariants are violated in final output, mode authority failed.

---

## Summary

Creative chaos is not the enemy.  
**Undeclared authority is.**

Modes are tools.  
Invariants are law.  
Momentum is protected by commitment.

If work feels confused, the solution is simple:
> *Declare authority or stop.*
