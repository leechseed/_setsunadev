# Pilot Episode Development — Layer-Bound Method

This is not “write a pilot.”
This is **prove the system can generate one**.

---

## STEP 1 — Lock the Pilot’s JOB (Non-Negotiable)

Before plot, before characters, answer this in one sentence:

> **What does this pilot exist to prove?**

Cost — *What cannot be kept*
**Survival exacts permanent loss.**

> Progress, endurance, or victory irreversibly removes something essential; residue compounds and cannot be restored.

---

## STEP 2 — Choose the Ending FIRST (Layer 6)

Adaptation — *How systems incorporate threat*
**Disruption is absorbed and normalized.**

> What once resisted becomes procedural, regulated, or commodified; the system grows stronger.



---

## STEP 3 — Define the Pilot’s Scope (Tight)

A pilot should have:

* **3–5 major scenes**
* **1 primary character POV**
* Victoria 'Tori' Midnight
* **1 visible power interface**
* **1 repeated pressure pattern**

No subplots. No lore flexing.

**Your task**:
Confirm:

* Single POV character (name or placeholder)
* The system / authority they collide with

---

## STEP 4 — Scene Skeleton (Layer 4–First)

We outline scenes *only* by **Expression Mechanics**.

Example structure (illustrative only):

| Scene | Dominant Layer 4 Move | What Changes                     |
| ----- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1     | Commit                | Character binds themselves       |
| 2     | Refuse                | System reroutes pressure         |
| 3     | Reveal                | Exposure increases vulnerability |
| 4     | Isolate               | Impact collapses to local        |
| 5     | Close                 | Exit path permanently ends       |

This prevents decorative scenes.

**Your task**:
Approve a **4–5 scene count** for the pilot.

---

## STEP 5 — Bind Layer 3 (Human Interface)

For each scene, pick **one dominant experience** only:

* Compression
* Ritualization
* Defiance without expectation
* Dissociation
* Stubborn continuity
* etc.

No emotional smearing.

---

## STEP 6 — Validate the Argument (Layer 5)

At the end, ask:

> If the protagonist failed completely, would the claim still be true?

If yes → valid pilot
If no → rewrite, not rethink

---

## WHAT WE DO NEXT (Concrete)

If you reply with the following **four answers**, I will generate the full pilot outline cleanly:

1. **Layer 5 claim** the pilot proves
2. **Layer 6 terminal state**
3. **POV character** + **system they collide with**
4. **Scene count** (4 or 5)

No prose yet.
No dialogue yet.
Just the **structural pilot blueprint**.

You’re officially out of theory land now.
