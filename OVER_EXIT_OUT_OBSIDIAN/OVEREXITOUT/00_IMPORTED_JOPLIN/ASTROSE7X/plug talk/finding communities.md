Yes — there are **active online communities** specifically focused on deep anal play, large toy insertion, and fisting. These spaces range from educational and technique-sharing hubs to hardcore kink groups. Here's a breakdown of the best places to look, based on your goals:

---

## 🌐 **Online Communities for Deep Anal Play / Fisting / Large Toy Use**

---

### 🧠 **1. Reddit**

Reddit has several **highly active subreddits** with user submissions, guides, toy reviews, and real progress tracking.

| Subreddit       | Focus Area                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| r/AnalTraining  | Training guides, toy progression, experience logs |
| r/Fisting       | Visuals, experiences, encouragement               |
| r/BigInsertions | Extreme toy use, deep/progressive insertion       |
| r/Buttsharpies  | Casual, fetish-heavy focus on everyday insertions |
| r/StretchyHole  | Show-off gallery of gapes and trained holes       |

**Tips**:

* Always check **NSFW filters** are enabled.
* Commenting in smaller communities gets more engagement than just posting pics.

### 🧷 **2. FetLife (fetlife.com)**

This is the **main social network for kink and BDSM**.

* Create a profile and search for:

  * Groups like **“Fisting Sluts,” “Butt Plug Addicts,” “Stretch Me Daddy,”** etc.
  * Local munches, events, and IRL meetups
* Active threads on:

  * Lube types
  * Anal stretching timelines
  * Training toys (SquarePegToys, Oxballs, etc.)
  * Post-session care, depth training, and enemas

**Pro**: You can filter by location and connect with doms/tops into your exact niche
**Con**: UI is janky and community leans older/male-heavy

---

### 📸 **3. Twitter / X (NSFW Accounts)**

If you're looking for **porn-adjacent inspiration, tutorials, or plug-use examples**, many adult creators post their training progress or hole-stretch clips.

* Search tags like:

  * `#AnalTraining`, `#HoleTraining`, `#FistMe`, `#GapeGoals`, `#PigHole`, `#BigToySlut`
* Many creators sell premium tutorials or plug cam content via DMs or Fansly/OnlyFans

**Caution**: It's a rabbit hole. Stay focused unless you're using it for technique reference or to vet potential doms.

---

### 🤖 **4. Discord (invite-based)**

There are **private and semi-public servers** for:

* Anal kink enthusiasts
* Stretching + toy progression groups
* Submissive prep and dom-sub training

**How to Find**:

* Ask in Reddit threads like `r/AnalTraining` or `r/Fisting`
* Look for links on FetLife group descriptions
* Use Discord server listing sites like [Disboard](https://disboard.org/) with terms like *fisting*, *anal*, *toys*, or *stretching*

**Pro Tip**: These servers often have channels like:

* `#hole-pics`
* `#toy-recommendations`
* `#training-plans`
* `#aftercare`

* **TheTrainingOfO.com** – erotic but also detailed about anal progression and submission.
* **realtalk.fyi** – occasional posts about safe anal play and kink exploration.
