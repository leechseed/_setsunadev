# 📘 Moral Premise Documentation | ASTRO7EX

---

Monsters are made from corrupted memory; meaning is chosen in spite of it.

## 🎯 Official Moral Premise

**When we act based on corrupted memory, we risk becoming monsters; when we accept our brokenness and choose meaning, we become whole.**

---

## 🧠 Justification for Selection (Dramatica Expert Rationale)

This moral premise is the core philosophical and emotional foundation of *ASTRO7EX*, aligning with all four Dramatica throughlines and directly emerging from the conflicts, reversals, and character dynamics of the narrative.

---

### 🔵 Main Character Throughline (Vivian)
- Vivian’s internal arc follows a **Resolve: Change** structure.
- She begins emotionally detached, drugged, and lobotomized—unable to remember her own trauma.
- Her growth lies in accepting her brokenness and choosing to act not because her memory is intact, but because meaning can still be made from what’s left.

---

### 🔴 Impact Character Throughline (Myrtle)
- Myrtle, the ghostly admirer, represents the haunting call to reclaim purpose.
- Though not real in the physical sense, she embodies Vivian’s unresolved memory, trauma, and conscience.
- She challenges Vivian to live with the uncertainty and choose significance over survival.

---

### ⚫ Objective Story Throughline (MORN, the 7, John Smith the Eternal)
- The external conflict revolves around the false belief that the crew resurrected the Godking AI.
- John Smith, the AI, acts on corrupted historical data and divine programming, committing violence in the name of mythic memory.
- His actions reflect the monster one becomes when purpose is built on corrupted or incomplete understanding.

---

### 🟢 Relationship Throughline (Vivian & Myrtle)
- Their bond symbolizes Vivian’s internal war between self-erasure and emotional reclamation.
- Myrtle represents the broken part of Vivian that still wants to care—even if the girl never existed.
- By accepting Myrtle’s influence and letting her go, Vivian reclaims her agency and commits to a meaningful future.

- Characters misinterpret or lose memory.
