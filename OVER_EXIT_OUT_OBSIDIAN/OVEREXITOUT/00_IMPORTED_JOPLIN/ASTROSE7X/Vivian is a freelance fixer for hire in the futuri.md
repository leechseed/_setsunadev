Vivian is a freelance fixer for hire in the futuristic mega cities of the lava tubes on the moon. 5 years after completing 'the heist ot end all heists' (stealing the 100 year old lost bitcoin usb wallet effectively becoming millionaires) she is jaded despite effectively being a god. However, when an assassin hyperhuman comes to extract visual data of the heist, Vivan discovers that at the bottom of that trash crater was something money couldn't solve.
