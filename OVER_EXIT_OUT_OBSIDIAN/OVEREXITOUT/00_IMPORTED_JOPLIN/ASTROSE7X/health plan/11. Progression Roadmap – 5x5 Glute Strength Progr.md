## Milestone Checkpoints
| Day | Lift | Target | Goal |
|-----|------|--------|------|
| Day 30 | Squat | BW x 1.25 | Clean, deep |
| Day 45 | Hip Thrust | BW x 2.0 | Controlled reps |
| Day 60 | Deadlift | BW x 1.5 | No form breakdown |
| Day 90 | Squat | BW x 1.5 | Full range mastery |
| Day 90 | Hip Thrust | BW x 2.5 | Glute pop achieved |

---

## Adjustment Protocol
- **Miss 2 reps in a set** → Repeat same weight next session.
- **Fail same lift 3 sessions in a row** → Deload 10%.
- **Feeling flat** → Take a backoff week with 80% load.

## Final Reminder
**Progress is non-negotiable.** If you're not adding weight, you’re adding intent: stricter form, slower reps, deeper range. Glutes don’t grow from comfort.

**Push. Track. Adapt. Grow.**
