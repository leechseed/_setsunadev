## Erotic Flow Themes (Saturday Rotation)
- **Self-Display**: Slow transitions between poses with a mirror or camera present
- **Breath as Moan**: Controlled exhalation paired with pelvic engagement
- **Mirror Seduction**: Yoga in front of mirror, gaze discipline
- **Edge While Flowing**: Include edging toy or vibration during static holds

---

## Best Practices
- Perform fully nude, in private space
- Light candles or red light for ambience
- Move with breath, not clock
- End each session in Savasana, touching your own skin gently

## Final Note
This is not gym yoga. This is **body worship as ritual**.  
Flexibility is not just for movement — it’s for exposure, surrender, and erotic grace.

**Stretch. Open. Present. Submit.**
