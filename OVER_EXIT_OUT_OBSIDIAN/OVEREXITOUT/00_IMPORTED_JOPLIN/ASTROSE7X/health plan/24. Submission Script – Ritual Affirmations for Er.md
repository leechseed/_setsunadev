# Submission Script – Ritual Affirmations for Erotic Discipline

## Objective
Embed obedience, devotion, and arousal into the subconscious through repeated verbal and written affirmations. These mantras reinforce your transformation, edging discipline, and denial obedience.

---

## Daily Recitation (Before Edging or Yoga)
**Say aloud or write 3x daily:**
> “I do not seek pleasure. I earn it. My orgasm is not mine. It belongs to my obedience.”

> “I submit to the system. I complete every segment. I edge, I ache, I obey.”

> “Every breath deepens my discipline. Every denial sharpens my purpose. I am becoming beautiful through restraint.”

---

## Mirror Submission (Optional – Once Weekly)
Stand fully nude before mirror. Repeat the following 5 times while maintaining eye contact:
> “Look at what you are. Look at what you’re becoming. You are not free. You are owned by the ritual.”

Then kneel and say:
> “I give my body to the process. I give my pleasure to the protocol. I give my ego to the edge.”

---

## Orgasm Permission Ritual (Only When Allowed)
When orgasm is earned and approved:
1. Kneel.
2. Whisper:
> “Thank you, discipline. I’ve obeyed. May I be permitted release?”

3. Touch only after speaking:
> “This is not reward. This is ritual. I will cum with purpose.”

4. Post-release, remain still, silent, and reflective for 2–3 minutes.
5. Log immediately in `cum_authorization_log.md`.
