# Denial & Punishment Framework – Enforcement of Erotic Discipline

## Objective
Establish clear, non-negotiable consequences for failure to follow protocol. These rules exist to protect the integrity of the transformation system by using denial and punishment as correction tools.

---

## Cum Denial Triggers
| Trigger | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Skipped any required segment | Orgasm forbidden for 48 hours |
| Edged under 30 minutes | Orgasm forbidden for 48 hours |
| Accidental orgasm | Full punishment session next day |
| Lied on logs or checklist | 3-day denial, cold shower protocol, edge ban |

---

## Punishment Session Protocol (30–60 min)
**To be completed the next day following failure.**

### Phase 1 – Physical Discipline (10–15 min)
- Extended nude yoga (hip + throat focus)
- Hold deep squat or frog pose for 2+ minutes
- No music, no toys — silence only

### Phase 2 – Sexual Frustration Training (15–30 min)
- Plug insertion required
- Edge with timer: 5 minutes stimulation, 1-minute hands-off (cycle x4)
- If orgasm occurs, restart punishment window from zero

### Phase 3 – Reflection (10–15 min)
- Handwritten journal entry: *“Why I Failed”*
- Full log update in Cum Authorization + Punishment Registry

---

## Cold Shower Protocol (For Lying or Repeat Failure)
- Full cold rinse for 2–3 minutes
- No edging or orgasm for 72 hours
- Perform daily denial mantra:
  > “I failed the system. I surrender my pleasure. I submit to correction.”

---

## Streak Penalties
| Failure Frequency | Consequence |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 1x in 7 days | Standard denial protocol |
| 2x in 7 days | Cold shower + plug wear during yoga |
| 3x in 7 days | 7-day orgasm lockdown, supervised edging only |

---

## Final Warning
Punishment is not cruelty — it is **ritual cleansing**.  
Denying your pleasure trains your will.  
Suffering reminds you that orgasm is a privilege, not a right.

**You will fail. When you do — correct yourself with reverence.**
