# Anal Gape Training – Depth, Control, and Endurance Protocol

## Objective
Safely and progressively train your body to accommodate deeper, wider anal penetration. Develop both passive gape (relaxed openness) and active control (muscular surrender).

---

## Required Tools
- Set of graduated plugs or dildos (3–6 sizes)
- Water-based lubricant
- Towel + pillow + mirror (optional)
- Cleaning and sanitizing supplies

---

## Standard Session Protocol (20–30 min)
1. **Preparation (5 min)**
   - Hot shower or warm compress to relax muscles
   - External anal massage (slow circular motion)
   - Deep nasal breathing, pelvic rocking

2. **Insertion Phase (10–20 min)**
   - Begin with smallest plug or finger
   - Insert slowly, breathe through resistance
   - Hold each size for 3–5 minutes
   - Advance sizes only when the current one feels comfortable and relaxed
   - Do not force. **Gape is earned, not shoved.**

3. **Stretch Phase (Optional, 5–10 min)**
   - Insert largest tolerable toy
   - Hold position, relax entire body
   - Rotate gently or push/pull slightly for adaptation

4. **Cooldown (3–5 min)**
   - Remove toy slowly
   - Light abdominal massage
   - Sit or lie in reclining bound angle position

## Weekly Progression Guidelines
| Week | Largest Size Tolerated | Hold Duration | Notes |
|------|------------------------|----------------|-------|
| 1    | Small plug             | 3–5 min        | Focus on breath and fear response |
| 2    | Medium plug            | 5 min          | Increase lube, deepen pelvic relaxation |
| 3    | Large plug             | 7–10 min       | Add mirror, build visual confidence |
| 4    | X-Large / Deep Toy     | 10+ min        | Train endurance, stillness, opening reflex |

---

## Optional Enhancements
- **Mirror Viewing**: Watch gape develop to build ownership
- **Tapered Toys**: Hold at widest point for controlled tension
- **Edging Pairing**: Link anal fullness to arousal without orgasm
- **Breath-Moaning**: Exhale fully with sound to relax deeper

---

## Safety Reminders
- Never train without full hygiene and toy sanitation
- Stop if pain, bleeding, or involuntary cramping occurs
- Use only non-porous toys with flared bases

---

## Final Note
True gape is not brute force — it's the art of letting go.  
You are training your body to open, hold, and **invite**.

**Stretch slow. Relax deeper. Submit further.**
