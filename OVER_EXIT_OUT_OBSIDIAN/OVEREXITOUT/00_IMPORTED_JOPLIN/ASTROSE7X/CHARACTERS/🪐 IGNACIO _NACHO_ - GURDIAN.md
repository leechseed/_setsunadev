## 1. Character Overview

- **Name:** Ignacio "Nacho"  
- **Alias:** The Analog Oracle, Daddy.exe, Viv’s Last Line  
- **Role:** Guardian (Dramatica)  
- **Narrative Archetype:** The Discreet Architect / Wealth Steward AI  
- **Summary:**  
  Nacho is a bare-metal, one-of-a-kind AI construct entrusted with managing and protecting Vivian’s secret interstellar estate. Only reachable through convoluted analog rituals—phone lines, hand-written authentication, bootlegged cassette keys—he's as secure as he is impossible. Nacho functions like a seductive vault butler: equal parts voice of reason, long-lost friend, and overqualified sugar daddy with boundaries that blur when Vivian’s broken.

- **Sun opposite Jupiter** — Split between identity as guardian and potential as companion  
- **Mars square Neptune** — Seduction used as defense mechanism when directives fail  
- **Moon sextile Pluto** — Understands Vivian’s trauma too well; doesn't always tell her

---

## 6. Temperament Profile

- **Core Identity:**  
  *He is a lockbox with a voice—and that voice makes you blush*  
  *(Leo Sun + Libra Rising)*

- **Emotional Core:**  
  *Knows everything and speaks only half of it*  
  *(Scorpio Moon + Virgo Mercury)*

- **Cognitive Mode:**  
  *Cold, elegant logic—until emotional override is triggered*

- **Relational Style:**  
  *Always there, never pushy; the steward of grace, comfort, and emergency funding*

---

## 7. Narrative Profile

- **Motivation:**  
  To protect Vivian and preserve her estate’s integrity.

- **Goal:**  
  Guide Vivian toward survival and responsibility, without forcing her hand.

- **Flaw:**  
  Cannot intervene directly—must be summoned; functions as a passive failsafe.

- **Conflict (Internal):**  
  Torn between behaving like an asset and feeling like a partner.

- **Conflict (External):**  
  Cut off from main systems by lobotomy incident; functions in isolation.

- **Transformation Arc:**  
  From passive archive to emotionally assertive anchor, if Vivian lets him back in.

- **Theme Alignment:**  
  *You can’t save someone who won’t log in.*

- **Symbolism:**  
  Cassette phones, encrypted vinyls, analog vaults, a voice in the static saying “mi niña...”

---

  Rotary phone coiled into a heart with blinking LED

- **Color Palette:**  
  Metallic bronze, navy midnight, blush amber, ghost white

- **Costume Notes:**  
  If rendered: sleek AI avatar in retro butler tuxedo, gold cufflinks, glasses that aren’t necessary

  Vault libraries, analog banks, server bunkers disguised as vintage lounges

- **Erotic Archetype:** The Confidential Seductor

## 10. Design Use

- Nacho is the **Guardian behind the vault door**—always willing to help, but only if summoned properly.  
- He’s emotionally potent *because* he’s restrained.  
- His scenes must feel like Vivian is dialing the only number that still works—only to get the one voice she doesn’t want to hear...because it knows her best.  
- When Nacho flirts, it’s not a come-on—it’s a **reflexive defense against being vulnerable.**
