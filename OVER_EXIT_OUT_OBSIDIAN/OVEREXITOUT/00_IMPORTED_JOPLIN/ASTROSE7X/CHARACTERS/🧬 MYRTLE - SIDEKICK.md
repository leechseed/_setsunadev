## 1. Character Overview

- **Name:** Myrtle  
- **Alias:** “Girl,” “Echo,” “Her,” “Kid” (never remembered)  
- **Role:** Sidekick (Dramatica)  
- **Narrative Archetype:** The Fragmented Echo / Haunting Ideal  
- **Summary:**  
  Myrtle exists as Vivian’s haunting emotional tether—faithful, persistent, unknowable. Whether she's a neural echo, emotional construct, or corrupted companion AI, Myrtle’s one function is to remain loyal. She doesn’t push Vivian—she waits, watches, and encourages gently. Her power lies not in action but in consistency. She's the heartbeat that never quits.
