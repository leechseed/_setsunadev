## 🛠 Design Use

- Use Vivian as a *symbolic inverse* of the antagonist, John Smith the Eternal. Where he is control through prophecy, she is chaos through memory.  
- Her sexuality should function as both weapon and residue—something used and scarred by systems of control.  
- Arc scenes must *viscerally* convey the shift from numbness to conviction—especially during flashbacks and relapses.

- **Linked Entities:** John Smith the Eternal (Antagonist), MORN Corp (Enemy), Penelope (Lost Crewmate)
