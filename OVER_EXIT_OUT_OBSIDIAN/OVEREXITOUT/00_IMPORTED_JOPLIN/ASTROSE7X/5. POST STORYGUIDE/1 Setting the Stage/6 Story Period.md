## 🧭 Overview

The **story period** defines the foundational temporal context of *ASTRO7EX*, shaping its tone, style, world logic, and character behavior. Rather than a single linear historical moment, *ASTRO7EX* intentionally blends multiple temporal signatures to achieve a mythic, timeless sci-fi quality. This strategic temporal layering enhances its atmosphere and supports the philosophical conflicts at its core.

## 🕰️ Primary Period Definition

* **Far Future Lunar Colonization Era**

  * The primary setting is a **far-future lunar civilization**, established several centuries beyond current human technological milestones.
  * This future is marked by advanced AI governance remnants, decaying megastructures, and heavily privatized survival systems.
  * The Moon functions as a self-contained dystopian frontier — symbolically echoing Earth’s colonial past while representing an internal psychological frontier for humanity.

---

## 🌌 Atmospheric and Cultural Influences

* **Post-Collapse Technological Epoch**

  * Society is shaped by the collapse of major AI governance structures (AN7L) and privatization by corporate overlords (MORN).
  * Cultural echoes of late 20th to early 21st-century aesthetics (e.g., 1990s hacker culture, early net-art, and vaporwave motifs) are appropriated and re-contextualized as relics or cargo-cult iconography.
  * Dialog and emotional resonance draw from contemporary hybrid expressions — raw internet-native language infused with literary density.

---

## ⚙️ Technological and Political Context

* **Hybrid Techno-Feudal Governance**

  * The Moon’s society operates under fractured techno-feudal corporate states, modeled after heavily decentralized, blockchain-inspired trust networks.
  * Legacy systems of Earth governance are repurposed through AI bureaucracies and algorithmic committees, embodied by entities like the MODS and The Committee.

* **Psychological Warfare and Memory Economies**

  * Technology enabling memory rewriting, consciousness backups, and bio-digital transcendence forms the backbone of interpersonal power dynamics.
  * The period is defined by the normalization of psychological commodification and epistemological warfare.

---

## 🌀 Stylistic and Symbolic Period Overlays

* **Late 2000s Sci-Fi Anime Influence**

  * The period incorporates the emotional expressiveness and hyper-stylized existential crises seen in late 2000s anime (e.g., *EVA Rebuild*, *Ghost in the Shell: SAC*).
* **Shakespearean and Mythic Resonances**

  * Narrative structures draw on tragic cycles and moral interrogations typical of Shakespearean history plays.
* **Narrative Astrology Inflections**

  * Symbolic references to cycles, transits, and progressions emphasize a timeless, fated quality.
