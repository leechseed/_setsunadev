⚡️ Excellent clarifying question. Let’s break it down clearly:

---

## 📙 **Format of ASTRO7EX**

### 💥 **Core Format**

* **Light Novel–Inspired Structure**, but not a traditional Japanese light novel in strictest sense.

---

### ✨ **What "Light Novel" Means Here**

* **Text-Heavy, Illustrated**: Primarily text, but punctuated by occasional highly-stylized illustrations to capture key emotional, symbolic, or fight moments.
* **Serialized Chapters**: Broken into arcs and chapters, each roughly the length of a novella installment, released episodically online.
* **Visual Accentuation**: Character spreads, splash pages, or symbolic diagrams that echo the metaphysical and cyber themes.
* **Stylized Language & Inner Monologues**: Deep psychological focus with raw, often fragmented internal narration — similar to many psychological or sci-fi light novels (e.g., *Boogiepop*, *All You Need Is Kill*).

---

### 🧬 **Hybridization with Web Serial**

* While ASTRO7EX takes inspiration from light novel format, its delivery method and audience interaction model align more with **web serials** (online, iterative, community-influenced).
* Less focus on "compact volumes sold as books" and more on living, evolving text drops.

---

### 🎭 **Why "Light Novel" Fits ASTRO7EX**

* Emphasizes intense, stylized inner voice and aesthetic impact rather than purely literary traditional prose.
* Supports the use of hyper-stylized visuals to punctuate major psychological or cosmic beats.
* Allows for complex metaphysical battles and abstract scenes that blend text and visual cues seamlessly.

## ✅ **Summary Statement**

> **ASTRO7EX is a web serial told in an online text format, using a light novel–inspired structure that fuses deep psychological narration, occasional symbolic illustrations, and serialized episodic releases.**

If you'd like, I can also diagram this as a "format blueprint" with breakdowns of volume structure, illustration cues, and episodic milestones. Just say the word!
