✅ **ASTRO7EX** is told in an **online text format**, specifically designed to be read as a **serialized web novel or web serial**, delivered episodically.

---

### 💻 **Medium Details**

* **Format**: Long-form text chapters posted online, typically around \~10k words per episode.
* **Release Style**: Serialized installments, designed for a hyper-engaged, advanced reader audience.
* **Pacing**: Each "episode" is self-contained enough to provide a satisfying narrative movement but intricately layered to reward deep reading and theory-crafting.
* **Platform**: Optimized for online reading environments — could include a dedicated website, web novel platforms, or even Substack-like serialized email delivery.

### 🧬 **Design Philosophy for the Medium**

* **Fragmented, Hyperlinked Feel**
  → The text feels like diving into corrupted logs, ghostly journal fragments, or intercepted transmissions. Interactivity is psychological — encouraging rereads, cross-references, and puzzle-solving.

* **Ephemeral Yet Permanent**
  → While each piece is meant to feel transient and haunting, it also builds a permanent meta-narrative across the serialized arcs.

* **Community Resonance**
  → Because it is online, the text invites collective interpretation and commentary — echoing ASTRO7EX’s themes of corrupted collective memory and distributed meaning.

### 🎭 **Why Online Text Format Fits ASTRO7EX**

* The text-as-code metaphor mirrors the story's themes of data corruption, ghost logic, and narrative as software patch.
* Readers experience the same instability and ambiguity as the characters — no fixed "canon" outside the living document.
* It leans into the feeling of being part of a "secret drop" or living ARG, echoing Vivian’s underground transmissions.

If you'd like, I can also draft a **medium strategy document**, including chapter structuring, possible meta-content (like "leaked" logs, fake data fragments), and reader engagement loops. Just say the word.
