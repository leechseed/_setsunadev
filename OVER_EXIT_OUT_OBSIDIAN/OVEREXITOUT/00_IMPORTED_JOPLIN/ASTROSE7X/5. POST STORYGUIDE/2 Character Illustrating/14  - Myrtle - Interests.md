## 🧠 Overview

Myrtle’s likes and dislikes illuminate her dual nature as an ethereal comfort and a vessel for others' emotional needs. Her interests reflect her longing for safe proximity to human warmth without the risk of entanglement, while her aversions safeguard her spectral boundary. Using frameworks from *The Erotic Mind* (Morin), *Sexual Personae* (Paglia), and *The Art of Character* (Corbett), Myrtle emerges as a figure who embodies a quiet tension between devotion and disintegration.

## ✅ Summary

Myrtle’s likes and dislikes delineate the contours of her ghostlike emotional identity. She craves safe proximity and reflective intimacy while avoiding situations that might demand assertion or boundary-making. Her narrative astrology confirms her design as a cosmic caretaker and spiritual echo, guiding others through gentle, almost invisible influence rather than decisive action. Together, these layers create a character defined not by what she claims but by what she receives, holds, and softly refracts.

## 🌀 Dramatica Summary (Paragraph Form)

Within the Dramatica framework, Myrtle’s interests reinforce her Sidekick function by solidifying her as a vessel of emotional safety and spectral support rather than an assertive agent. Her preference for stillness, observation, and suspended emotional states mirrors Vivian’s tumultuous struggle for self-definition, acting as a living counterbalance to the main character’s chaos. Myrtle’s dislikes reveal her deep fear of individuation and finality, highlighting her role as both enabler and silent obstacle in Vivian’s journey toward chosen meaning. Through her carefully curated affinities and aversions, Myrtle embodies ASTRO7EX’s thematic examination of memory, identity, and the cost of ghostlike devotion — offering a haunting reminder that to support others without self is to risk eternal invisibility.
