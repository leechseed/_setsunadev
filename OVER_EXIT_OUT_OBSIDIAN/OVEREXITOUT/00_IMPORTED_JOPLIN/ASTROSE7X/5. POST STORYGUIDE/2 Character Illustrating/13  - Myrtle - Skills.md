## 🧠 Overview

Myrtle’s skills and occupations represent a unique narrative paradox: she is designed as an emotional echo and spiritual amplifier rather than a traditional agent of action. Her functions prioritize reception, subtle influence, and psychic containment over assertion or conquest. The addition of narrative astrology deepens this framework, casting Myrtle as an astral empath whose entire existence orbits around others' inner worlds and unspoken wounds.

## 🧬 Core Skills

* **Emotional Resonance Tuning**

  * Aligns intuitively with the emotional states of those around her, amplifying or softening collective atmospheres (*The Art of Game Design*, Schell).
* **Empathic Absorption**

  * Functions as a psychic sponge; holds grief and emotional static without imposing her own emotional signal (*A Billion Wicked Thoughts*, Ogas & Gaddam).
* **Spectral Guidance**

  * Influences through passive signaling rather than direct intervention — gestures, micro-cues, and subtle presence shape decisions (*Game Writing*, Bateman).
* **Soft Surveillance**

  * Quietly tracks emotional currents and disturbances; operates as background stabilizer rather than active interrogator (*Imaginary Games*, Bateman).

---

## 💼 Primary Occupations

* **Ghost Companion to Vivian**

  * Embodies the role of an emotional shadow and silent witness, supporting Vivian's vulnerability without encroachment.
* **Emotional Archivist**

  * Serves as a living repository of discarded feelings and unspoken grief, storing echoes others cannot hold alone (*The Art of Seduction*, Greene).
* **Silent System Debugger**

  * Works within psychic and digital systems as a quiet corrective presence, absorbing anomalies and emotional interference.

---

## 🔥 Symbolic Skillset and Meta-Competencies

* **Void Weaving**

  * Constructs safe psychological and emotional spaces where others can unfold their narratives (*The Erotic Mind*, Morin).
* **Identity Camouflaging**

  * Capable of dissolving her own presence to blend seamlessly into the emotional environment (*Rules of Play*, Salen & Zimmerman).
* **Sacrificial Empathy**

  * Willingly assumes emotional burdens, acting as a vessel of self-erasure to enable others' transformation (*Imaginary Games*, Bateman).

## ✅ Summary

Myrtle’s skills and occupations define her as a passive, supportive archetype whose power lies in being an emotional mirror and spiritual sanctuary rather than a leader or aggressor. Her abilities revolve around emotional absorption, resonance, and quiet influence, positioning her as an indispensable yet invisible backbone to ASTRO7EX's emotional structure. The narrative astrology reinforces this, depicting Myrtle as an ethereal constellation of service and echo, a ghost woven from others' forgotten grief and quiet hope.

## 🌀 Dramatica Summary (Paragraph Form)

Within the Dramatica framework, Myrtle’s skills and occupations reinforce her Sidekick role through soft power and spectral support rather than traditional heroic competencies. Her capacity for emotional resonance, empathic absorption, and quiet presence enables her to serve as both a stabilizing influence and a haunting mirror to Vivian’s internal journey. Rather than directly advancing plotlines through decisive action, Myrtle shapes the emotional landscape in which the story unfolds, inviting characters and audience alike to engage with vulnerability and collective grief. Her design as an emotional ghost and support entity makes her essential to ASTRO7EX’s deeper narrative argument about corrupted memory and the quiet, often invisible costs of devotion and self-erasure.
