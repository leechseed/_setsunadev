## 1. Character Description

### 🔵 **Vivian** – *Protagonist*

* **Motivation**: Consider, Pursuit
* **Purpose**: Knowledge, Actuality, Order, Change
* **Evaluation**: Proven, Effect
* **Methodology**: Certainty, Proaction

> Vivian is the emotional, flawed, intuitive heart of ASTRO7EX. Reckless and calculating, she operates on a wounded blend of instinct and intellect. She leads not because she wants to, but because no one else will. She chases truth like it's the last drug left. Drenched in unresolved grief, she represents the **refusal to forget** and the **desperation to matter**. She is alive in a world built for the dead.

---

## 2. Narrative Function

### 🎭 Dramatic Function: **Protagonist**

In Dramatica theory, the **Protagonist** is the character most committed to pursuing the Story Goal. This character drives the narrative forward with **motivation and intent**, even if they lack full understanding or clarity. The Protagonist anchors the plot with urgency and often wrestles with competing truths, becoming the lens through which we feel thematic consequences.

---

### 2.1. Momentum Through Emotional Will

Vivian operates through raw willpower. Her decisions are not always logical, but they are always *charged*. Every action is a flare shot into a dead sky, daring the universe to respond. Where others pause, she lunges. Where others speculate, she moves.

Her faith is not in plans but in *motion*.

---

### 2.2. Spiritual Antagonism With Structure

Vivian is not rebelling for rebellion's sake—she is **opposed by the shape of the world itself**. MODS, The Committee, Fiona, John Smith—each represents a structure that either numbs, diverts, explains, or finalizes. Vivian's role is not to be right. Her role is to *refuse to be told what is enough.*

She challenges the world's answer with another question.

---

### 2.3. Struggle Between Truth and Comfort

Vivian's journey is one of constant temptation. Fiona offers comfort. John Smith offers resolution. MODS offer absolution through forgetfulness. Each presents a false form of peace. Vivian resists not with argument, but with *persistence*.

> She does not debate—she insists.

Her arc is not about finding comfort but **making peace with pain**.

---

### 2.4. Reluctant Heroine as Meaning Seeker

Vivian's heroism is reluctant. She has been dragged to the front of the story by loss and refusal. She doesn't want to be the answer; she wants to *find one*. This positions her not as the savior archetype, but the **meaning-seeker** who drags narrative with her just by showing up again.

---

### 2.5. Temporal Anchor and Agent of Change

Unlike MODS (Inertia) or Fiona (Unending), Vivian is *Change*. She transforms every environment simply by **surviving within it**. Her actions ripple through the narrative not because they are large, but because they are *unrelenting*.

She is the change the system didn’t plan for.

---

## 3. Activity Profile

### 🔵 **Vivian’s Activities (Protagonist Function)**

Vivian pushes the story forward not just through action, but through **insistence on meaning**. Every time she refuses to comply, the world must respond. Her presence interrogates every system, every rule, every promise. She shows up at your door with tears in her throat and a gun in her hand, asking why you gave up.

Her scenes are marked by:

* Refusal to be silenced
* Rejection of compromise
* Demands for proof or belief

Even her silences are indictments.

---

## 4. Summary

> Vivian is not the solution. She is the refusal to accept anything less.

As the **Protagonist**, Vivian drives ASTRO7EX forward with emotional velocity and unhealed memory. She represents the person who keeps getting up even when the story has given her no reason to. She is not hope. She is *hunger*.

In ASTRO7EX, **Vivian is not what saves the world—she’s what makes it worth saving.**
