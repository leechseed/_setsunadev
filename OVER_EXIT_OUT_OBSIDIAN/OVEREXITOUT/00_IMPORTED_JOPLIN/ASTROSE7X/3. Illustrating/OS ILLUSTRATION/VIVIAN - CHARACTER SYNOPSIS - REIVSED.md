## 🧬 Overview

Vivian is the **Protagonist** of ASTRO7EX, not in the sense of a conquering hero, but as a fractured soul clawing toward coherence. Her core identity is marked by **resistance through contradiction**—she seeks meaning in a world that offers only patternless pain, logic without heart, and systems without exit. She doesn’t conquer obstacles so much as refuse their finality. Her strength lies not in clarity, but in her refusal to go silent.

## 🧩 Character Functions

* **Dramatica Role**: Protagonist
* **Core Dynamic**: Seeks resolution through emotional authenticity, not logical completion
* **Archetypal Mask**: Rebel-Saint, both broken and breaking
* **Thematic Drive**: "Monsters are made from corrupted memory; meaning is chosen in spite of it."

---

## 🎭 Dramatic Summary

Vivian's world is not a battlefield of clear goals—it is a chorus of *resistance* sung in six tones: pleasure, fate, silence, memory, ethics, and protocol. Each relationship reflects her **existential tug-of-war** between becoming a monster and finding meaning. She doesn’t change the world. She insists on being seen by it.

> She is not the chosen one.
> She is the *noisy one.*
