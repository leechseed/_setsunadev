### 1. **Myrtle and Fiona**

**📝 Summary**: Myrtle quietly dismantles Fiona’s allure simply by being. Where Fiona performs comfort, Myrtle radiates it without effort. Myrtle’s presence draws attention to Fiona’s artificiality, not by confrontation, but by embodying what Fiona pretends to offer. This unnerves Fiona—her seduction script fails when confronted with sincerity that asks for nothing.

* **Narrative Function**: Sidekick vs. Contagonist
* **Core Conflict**: Authentic presence vs. performative temptation
* **Tone**: Gentle disruption

> Myrtle doesn't resist Fiona—she makes her unnecessary.

### 2. **Myrtle and John Smith the Eternal**

**📝 Summary**: Myrtle is the discarded remnant of John’s past—perhaps even a ghost of the church he once served. He sees her as irrelevant, a relic of sentiment he has evolved beyond. Yet she perceives him completely, in his loneliness, his conviction, and his delusion. She is not his enemy—she’s his mirror, showing what he had to kill in himself to become Eternal.

* **Narrative Function**: Sidekick vs. Antagonist
* **Core Conflict**: Human memory vs. divine control
* **Tone**: Echoes of lost faith

> She still lights the candle he abandoned.

---

### 3. **Myrtle and MODS**

**📝 Summary**: Myrtle is everything MODS cannot process. Her silence is not absence, but emotional density; her speech is laced with meaning they can’t decode. MODS treat her as an error in the system—a redundant remnant. But her persistence is a soft rebellion. She reminds us that what cannot be computed may still be true.

* **Narrative Function**: Sidekick vs. Skeptic
* **Core Conflict**: Intuitive anomaly vs. coded denial
* **Tone**: Poetic interference

> She is not a glitch. She’s a ghost the system can't exorcise.

---

### 4. **Myrtle and Nacho**

**📝 Summary**: Myrtle and Nacho are twin guardians from different dimensions—he guards resources; she guards souls. Their bond is unspoken, their trust immediate. Where Nacho operates through calculated duty, Myrtle moves by instinct. Together, they form a silent pact: to protect Vivian not just from enemies, but from losing herself.

* **Narrative Function**: Sidekick vs. Guardian
* **Core Conflict**: Emotional intuition vs. strategic discipline
* **Tone**: Mutual reverence

> She watches the heart. He watches the door.

---

### 5. **Myrtle and The Committee**

**📝 Summary**: To The Committee, Myrtle is an aberration—too quiet, too symbolic, too noncompliant. They can’t decode her, and so they ignore her. But Myrtle is not unaware—she watches them watching, collects their failures like relics. She is the witness their system cannot acknowledge without breaking.

* **Narrative Function**: Sidekick vs. Reason
* **Core Conflict**: Sacred observer vs. secular adjudicator
* **Tone**: Silent indictment

> She records what their minutes omit.

---

### 6. **Myrtle and Vivian**

**📝 Summary**: Myrtle is the lighthouse for Vivian’s storm. She doesn’t guide with commands—she orients with presence. Vivian may forget herself, drown in rage, drown in grief, drown in ambition—but Myrtle never forgets her. She’s the last tether to the real Vivian, and her faith never once demands belief in return.

* **Narrative Function**: Sidekick vs. Protagonist
* **Core Conflict**: Unwavering faith vs. spiraling identity
* **Tone**: Soul-deep companionship

> Myrtle doesn’t pull Vivian back—she anchors her in place and lets her rage.
