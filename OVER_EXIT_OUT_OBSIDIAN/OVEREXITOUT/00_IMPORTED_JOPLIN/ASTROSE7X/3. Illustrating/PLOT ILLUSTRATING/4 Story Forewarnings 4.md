To identify the **best-fitting forewarnings** for **ASTRO7EX**, we must align across four intersecting lenses:

---

## 🧩 **Alignment Criteria**

### 🔷 **ASTRO7EX Narrative DNA**

* *Tone*: techno-death, corrupted memory, bureaucratic decay, psychic grief
* *Function*: Forewarnings should foreshadow **looming Consequences** while characters remain unaware or unable to act
* *Aesthetic*: psychological coldness punctuated by spiritual rupture

### 📘 **Harold Bloom**

* *Vision*: the “agon” of characters reenacting dead scripts; identity shaped by misread inheritance
* *Forewarnings must embody*: **False legacy**, **misapplied authority**, **rituals haunted by meaninglessness**

### 🧠 **Dramatica**

* *Purpose of Forewarnings*: Indicate the **limit is closing in**—the Story Consequences may soon come to pass
* *Domain of Forewarnings in ASTRO7EX*: **Overall Story Throughline** → *Situation* → “Prophets of Rot”
* *Ideal Forewarnings*: **external symptoms** of internal deterioration; visible, but misinterpreted

### 🎥 **2000s Sci-Fi / Thriller / Anime Influence**

* *Stylistic Models*: *The Matrix*, *Fight Club*, *Cowboy Bebop*, *District 9*, *Bourne Identity*
* *Core Techniques*: glitch aesthetic, performative normalcy, looping routine, dissonant world logic, trauma-as-structure
