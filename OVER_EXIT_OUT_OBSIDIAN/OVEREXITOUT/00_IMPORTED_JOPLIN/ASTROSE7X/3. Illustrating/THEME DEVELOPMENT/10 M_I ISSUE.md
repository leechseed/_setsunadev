## 🧭 Overview

This report focuses on the **Main vs. Impact Character Story Issue** in ASTRO7EX: *Sense of Self*. This thematic issue emerges at the intersection between **Vivian** (Main Character) and the **MODS** (Impact Characters). It defines the **emotional and philosophical terrain** of their relationship—what is at stake, what is resisted, and what is exposed.

Rather than aligning directly with either the MC’s or IC’s thematic axis, the M/I Issue explores what **exists between them**: the unresolved territory, the shared discomfort, the dissonant frequency. In ASTRO7EX, this unresolved center is *Sense of Self*—Vivian's volatile identity clashing against the MODS' total erasure of subjectivity.

---

## 📖 Definition – Sense of Self

* **Sense of Self**: One’s perception of oneself—how a person defines their identity, role, and interior worth.
* **Dynamic Pair**: *State of Being* — One’s true nature, stripped of social, narrative, or constructed identity.

---

## 🧱 Structural Theory – The Role of the M/I Issue

In Dramatica, the **Main vs. Impact Story Issue** reveals the central **value standard** by which the relationship is judged.

* It functions as the **axis of emotional pressure** within the relationship.
* Unlike the MC or IC Issues, the M/I Issue asks: *What value causes the pain between them?*
* In ASTRO7EX, *Sense of Self* is the exact point where Vivian's humanity and the MODS' machinery **fail to connect.**

This issue does not belong to one character—it belongs to the *space between them*.

## 🌑 ASTRO7EX Expression – Sense of Self in Vivian vs. MODS

In ASTRO7EX, *Sense of Self* emerges through repeated scenes of **disregard, misrecognition, and identity erosion**. It is where Vivian’s unstable ego and spiritual longing grind against the MODS’ total **denial of identity as a valid concept**.

### Expression in Vivian:

* Constantly seeks **mirrored recognition**—“Do you see me?”
* Uses performance, violence, sex, hacking as means of asserting “I exist.”
* Craves acknowledgment not from friends, but from the system that erased her.

### Expression in MODS:

* Offer no recognition—only procedural output.
* Deny even the premise of identity: “You are not exceptional.”
* Force Vivian into confrontation with her *irrelevance* in the system.

The MODS do not attack her identity—they ignore it, overwrite it, or reduce it to protocol.

---

## 👥 Character-by-Character Breakdown

### **Vivian (Main Character)**

* Driven by the ghost of who she used to be.
* Suffers psychic fragmentation from past roles: soldier, thief, survivor, prophet.
* Views identity as *something to reclaim*.
* Haunted by the idea she was meant for something greater—and fears she’s already failed.

### **MODS (Impact Characters)**

* Do not *have* a “self.”
* Act as interface protocols—never “characters” in the human sense.
* Their consistency forces Vivian to confront that she might be making it all up.
* Represent the horror of being truly **unseen** by the thing that governs your reality.

## 🔍 Thematic Analysis – Literary & Mythic Lenses

### 🧠 Harold Bloom – *The Anxiety of Identity*

* Vivian’s identity crisis mirrors Bloom’s reading of American protagonists as fractured, haunted by unrealized potential.
* Her *Sense of Self* is not stable—it is overdetermined, filled with old voices and future ghosts.

### 🛡 Joseph Campbell – *The Refusal of the Call*

* The MODS are the **threshold guardian**, not of action, but of identity.
* They do not block Vivian’s quest—they erase the *meaning* of her crossing.

### 🛰 Early 2000s Sci-Fi Anime

* *Lain*, *Texhnolyze*, *Ergo Proxy*: protagonists dissolve into digital or systemic networks.
* Vivian’s selfhood is constantly filtered, refracted, modulated by tech interfaces.
* The MODS reflect the *death of subjectivity* common in post-cyberpunk narratives.

### 🎭 Robert McKee

* The relationship is not dramatic—it’s *ontological*.
* Scene-to-scene, the conflict is in **how Vivian defines herself**—and how the MODS flatten or reject that definition.

## 📊 Spectrum Placement – Authorial Value Judgment

> **Where does ASTRO7EX fall on the Sense of Self spectrum?**

**Position:** 3 out of 11 (Left-leaning: *Mildly Advantageous*)

**Interpretation**:

* *Sense of Self* is portrayed as **necessary but unstable**.
* It is *not inherently virtuous*, but its absence is *inhuman*.
* The story doesn’t reward Vivian for having a strong identity—but it **respects her refusal to erase it.**

---

## 🧩 Summary – How Sense of Self Functions in ASTRO7EX

The M/I thematic issue of *Sense of Self* defines the core **emotional wound** in ASTRO7EX: Vivian wants to be **seen**, and the MODS cannot *see*. Their relationship functions not as drama, but as contradiction. The pressure between self-definition and structural erasure creates the story’s deepest tension.

The narrative’s ultimate statement is clear:

* Even if identity is fractured, unstable, or performative…
* It is *still more human than absence*.
