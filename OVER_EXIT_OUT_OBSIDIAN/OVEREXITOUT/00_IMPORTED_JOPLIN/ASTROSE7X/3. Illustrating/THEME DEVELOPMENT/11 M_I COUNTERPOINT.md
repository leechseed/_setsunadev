## 🧭 Overview

This report examines the **Main vs. Impact Character Counterpoint** in ASTRO7EX: *State of Being*. As the thematic antithesis to *Sense of Self*, *State of Being* surfaces in the *relational space* between **Vivian** and the **MODS**—less about who they think they are, and more about what they *actually are* beneath roles, protocols, and perceptions.

Where *Sense of Self* explores identity as self-perception and projection, *State of Being* interrogates the raw, unchangeable *nature* of those involved. The tension arises not in *who they appear to be*—but *what they truly are,* stripped of narrative, stripped of myth.

## 📖 Definition – State of Being

* **State of Being**: One’s true nature—the unfiltered, existential condition of existence.
* **Dynamic Pair**: *Sense of Self* — One’s perceived identity; the mask, the persona, the role.

## 🧱 Structural Theory – The Role of the M/I Counterpoint

In Dramatica, the **M/I Story Counterpoint** is not just the “opposite” of the Issue, but its **hidden critique**. It is where the audience is given a chance to contrast **appearance vs. essence**.

* *Sense of Self* is **fragile, narrative-driven, and shaped by others.**
* *State of Being* is **brutal, stable, and uncaring.**

While the story focuses on identity as an experience, *State of Being* reminds us: **There is something underneath that will never change.**

## 🌑 ASTRO7EX Expression – State of Being in Vivian vs. MODS

In ASTRO7EX, the *State of Being* counterpoint is explored in quiet, brutal moments—*where performance stops, and truth bleeds through*.

### Expression in Vivian:

* Beneath her identity (soldier, thief, prophet), she is a **child soldier, conditioned to kill, built to survive.**
* Her “self” may evolve, but her *being*—what she is capable of—remains terrifyingly constant.
* In vulnerable scenes, she recognizes: “I was made for war.”

### Expression in MODS:

* They don’t *become* anything.
* Their *State of Being* is recursive, encoded, static.
* They embody **existence without narrative.**
* No history. No self. Only *what they are*: a protocol that endures.

When they speak, it is not character—it is **condition**.

---

## 👥 Character-by-Character Breakdown

### **Vivian (Main Character)**

* Feels her identity is something she can reclaim, control, or shape.
* But her *State of Being*—the trauma, the reflexes, the instincts—remains.
* The MODS confront her with what she *can’t change*, even as she tries.

### **MODS (Impact Characters)**

* Have no identity crisis because they never pretended to be anything else.
* Their *State of Being* is **their function**.
* This constancy is not moral—it is horrifying.
* Their refusal to change reveals Vivian’s own inability to *escape her nature*.

---

## 🔍 Thematic Analysis – Literary & Mythic Lenses

### 🧠 Harold Bloom – *The Burden of Inheritance*

* Vivian’s *State of Being* is overdetermined: born of violence, trained by the system.
* Like Bloom’s tragic heroes, she tries to author her life—but is defined by a force older than her will.

### 🛡 Joseph Campbell – *The Shadow Self*

* The MODS are the *shadow* of Vivian: not her enemy, but her **undeniable essence**.
* In myth, the final trial is not to defeat the dragon—but to admit that the dragon lives inside you.

### 🛰 Early 2000s Sci-Fi Anime

* *Texhnolyze*, *Ergo Proxy*, *Boogiepop Phantom*: Characters often transcend or *succumb* to their State of Being.
* Vivian is not the *protagonist who finds herself*, but the one who **fears what she already knows**.

### 🎭 Robert McKee – *Being vs. Doing*

* Every choice Vivian makes stems not from what she wants—but from **what she is**.
* The MODS push her not through action, but through *ontology*: they make her confront **herself**.

## 📊 Spectrum Placement – Authorial Value Judgment

> **Where does ASTRO7EX fall on the State of Being spectrum?**

**Position:** 8 out of 11 (Right-leaning: *Moderately Disadvantageous*)

**Interpretation**:

* The story presents *State of Being* as **something unavoidable**, but not noble.
* Its constancy is oppressive, not liberating.
* In ASTRO7EX, to live according to one’s true nature is to risk becoming a **mechanism** instead of a soul.

## 🧩 Summary – How State of Being Functions in ASTRO7EX

*State of Being* defines the **tragic underside** of the Vivian-MODS relationship. Where *Sense of Self* is fluid and aspirational, *State of Being* is static and cruel. It strips away the comfort of reinvention and exposes the truth beneath performance: some things do not change, no matter how much we scream.

In this narrative:

* The MODS confront Vivian not with antagonism—but with **inevitability**.
* Vivian’s defiance is not in becoming someone new—but in **refusing to believe that who she is now is all she ever was.**
