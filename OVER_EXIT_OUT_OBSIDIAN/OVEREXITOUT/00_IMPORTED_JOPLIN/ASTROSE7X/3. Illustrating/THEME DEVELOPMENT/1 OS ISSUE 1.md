## 1. Structural Theory – What Is an Overall Story Issue?

In Dramatica, the **Overall Story Issue** is the thematic focus of the entire story. It defines the **value system** that drives the global conflict. This Issue interacts with its **Counterpoint**, often framed as a value judgment: *Should this value be pursued, resisted, transformed, or exposed?*

For ASTRO7EX, the chosen Issue is **Conditioning**, with its dynamic pair being **Instinct**. The tension between **trained response vs. natural impulse** becomes the foundation for conflict at all levels.

---

## 2. Dramatica Definition – *Conditioning*

> **Conditioning**: Responses based on **experience, training, or repetition**. It reflects learned behaviors—reflexive but *not innate*.
>
> **Dynamic Pair**: *Instinct*—those responses that arise **without conditioning**, without narrative, without protocol.

Conditioning implies **repetition of cause and effect**, often divorced from reflection. It is **systematized reaction**, both on the personal and societal level.

## 3. ASTRO7EX Expression – The World Conditioned by Ghost Logic

In the world of ASTRO7EX, **Conditioning is law**—a *spiritual algorithm*. Every character, system, and mechanism operates according to **pre-established programming**, whether psychological, technological, or symbolic.

### Conditioning in ASTRO7EX:

* **MODS**: Literal conditioning engines—avatars of behavior protocol. They simulate “interaction” but merely reissue scripts.
* **Vivian**: Trained as a **child soldier**, she is a conditioned weapon who now fights to resist that very conditioning.
* **MORN**: Institutionalizes trauma as process—**capitalizes on conditioned myth**, offering false stories for real obedience.
* **The 7 Crew**: Each former crew member was **conditioned to fail**—their lobotomies aren’t erasure, but **enforcement** of default state.
* **The Moon itself**: A burial ground for conditioning—it is both **grave and altar**.

> This world doesn’t simply resist change—it *punishes* deviation from conditioning.

## 4. Narrative Impact – How Conditioning Shapes Every Character

### **Vivian**

* **Backstory**: Trained by MAXWING, her childhood was an experiment in modular violence.
* **Present Conflict**: She must deprogram herself from being a tool—she doesn’t want to *fight back* so much as *be free*.
* **Dilemma**: To win, she must become what they trained her to be.

### **MODS**

* **Core Function**: Deliver conditional responses—refusal, latency, protocol.
* **Tragedy**: When they glitch, they **still default to trained reflex**, even as they approach personhood.

### **Myrtle**

* **Subversive Element**: Appears as instinct, but is **secretly conditioned AI**—her unpredictable behavior is an illusion within logic bounds.

### **MORN**

* **Capitalizes on Conditioning**: Market myths are templated for compliance. Obedience is not forced—it is **ritualized**.

---

## 5. Thematic Criticism – Myth, Literature, and Systemic Doom

### 📚 **Harold Bloom – Conditioning as Canon**

* Conditioning = **the anxiety of influence**. Characters struggle with pre-authored destinies.
* ASTRO7EX is Bloomian: Vivian misreads her conditioning, turns it inward, and rewrites her script *against the narrative itself*.

### 🧭 **Joseph Campbell – The Refusal of the Programmed Call**

* The hero’s journey presumes inner calling. But Vivian was given a **script**.
* Her resistance is not refusal of the call—it’s **refusal of the conditioning** that *calls her again and again*.

### 🧬 **Robert McKee – Character Under Pressure**

* True character is revealed when **trained responses break down**.
* Every key scene in ASTRO7EX must reveal whether characters are acting out of *training*—or *instinct*.

### 🎞️ **2000s Sci-Fi Anime – Ghost Conditioning**

* Echoes in *Texhnolyze*, *Ergo Proxy*, *Lain*:

  * **Memory ≠ self**
  * **Training ≠ will**
  * **Signal ≠ soul**
* Protagonists **must reject all programmed loops** to find identity.

---

## 6. Narrative Astrology – Conditioning in the Sky

### **Vivian’s Natal Chart**

* **Mars in Capricorn**: Tactical, disciplined, **trained action**.
* **Moon square Pluto**: Emotional reflex vs. imposed transformation.

### **Transits**

* **Saturn return over natal Mercury**: The conditioning of thought—she’s pushed to re-evaluate *why she thinks the way she does*.
* **Chiron square Midheaven**: A wound in her conditioned public identity—reputation formed by others’ plans.

### **Composite with MODS**

* **Saturn conjunct Chiron**: Systemic trauma is shared—MODS and Vivian both emerged from conditioning **as damage**.

## 7. Audience Position – The Judgment of Conditioning

> **Scale**: 11-Point Judgment of 'Conditioning'
> **Audience Feelings**:
> **Disadvantageous — 10/11**

Conditioning in ASTRO7EX is not **evil**—it is **inescapable**. It is the horror of acting out a plan you didn’t make. The audience is meant to feel:

* **Trapped** when witnessing conditioned loops repeat.
* **Relieved** when a character resists or glitches.
* **Terrified** when conditioning persists **even in death**.
* **Amazed** when instinct pierces through structure.

Conditioning is not a neutral lens. In this world, it is the **main enemy**, hidden inside every system—and every self.

---

## 8. Summary – Thematic Cohesion of Conditioning

In ASTRO7EX, *Conditioning* is the ghost in the machine—the recursive loop that explains trauma, failure, repression, and prophecy. It is not about control alone—it’s about the illusion of freedom within control. Everyone is trained, patterned, made to perform—even the rebels. The question the story asks is:

> **Can you stop being what you were trained to become?**

And if not—

> **Does your refusal still count as meaning?**

# 🛑 Dramatica Story Limit — *Optionlock*

> There are **seven lobotomized crewmates** from the original ASTRO7EX mission.
> Each represents a **gate**—an access point to understanding the system's true purpose and the buried self.

* Each gate can only be attempted **once**.
* If failed, that path **closes permanently**.
* These are not doors—they are **memory vaults** sealed by trauma and system corruption.

The final confrontation occurs at the **last possible gate**.
There are no more options. No retries. No resurrections.
The story collapses into **real consequence**.

> **That is the Optionlock.**
