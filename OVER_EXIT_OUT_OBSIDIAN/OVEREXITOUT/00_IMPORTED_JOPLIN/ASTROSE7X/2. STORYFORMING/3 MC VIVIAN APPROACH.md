Excellent—this is the **MC Approach** question in Dramatica Storyforming:

> Does your Main Character prefer to resolve personal problems **externally** (*Do-er*) or **internally** (*Be-er*)?

This decision defines **how Vivian tackles her personal struggles**, not just what she’s capable of. It answers:

> *“When confronted with a problem, does she change the world, or try to change herself?”*

We’ll explore both options in detail using Dramatica theory, her **narratological birth chart**, and **symbolic narrative astrology**.

---

## 🔨 OPTION 1: **Do-er**

> “If something’s wrong, I’ll take action. I’ll make it move. I’ll break it open.”

---

### 🧠 Dramatica Theory

* A **Do-er** sees **external change** as the solution to internal conflict.
* Even when the pain is personal, the response is outward: move, fight, hack, flee, kill, steal, sabotage.
* This character tends to act first and reflect later (if at all).

### 🪐 Narrative Astrology: Signs of a Do-er

| Astrological Placement       | Interpretation                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ☉ **Libra Sun**              | Negotiator by role—but not passive. Will push when lines are crossed.   |
| 🌙 **Pisces Moon**           | Emotionally sensitive, yes—but expressed through *escapism* (movement). |
| ↑ **Gemini Rising**          | Responds rapidly to stimuli. Adapts externally. Persona-first survival. |
| ♂ **Aries Mars** (canonical) | Direct action, instinctive aggression, fast reaction.                   |
| ☿ **Scorpio Mercury**        | Controls narrative through communication—but when cornered, cuts deep.  |
| ♄ **Capricorn Saturn**       | Channeling pain into systems, control, and structure—never wallowing.   |

Her chart is full of **displacement strategies**: change the room, the mask, the rules—not herself.

### 🌌 Transits (Symbolic)

* **Uranus square Moon** → *Emotions trigger disruption; she moves.*
* **Mars return** → *Fights back the moment the world pushes.*
* **Neptune in 10th** → *Public persona as escape from inner truth.*

Vivian reacts not by turning inward, but by breaking the surface.

---

### 🧠 Story Application

In **ASTRO7EX**:

* Vivian **infiltrates**, **sabotages**, **steals**, **escapes**, **fucks**, **kills**, and **runs**.
* She doesn’t “heal” until something external is burned down.
* She is a soldier, not a mystic.
* Even her **numbness** is expressed through **doing**: drug runs, sexual rituals, self-debasement.

She is not still. She is **kinetic trauma**.

---

## 🧘 OPTION 2: **Be-er**

> “If something’s wrong, I’ll adapt. I’ll suppress. I’ll bear it until it stops.”

---

### 🧠 Dramatica Theory

* A **Be-er** believes the problem lies within.
* They bend, delay, internalize, adjust behavior, retreat into roles or rituals.
* The solution is **emotional or identity-based**.

---

### 🪐 Does it fit Vivian?

She *has* Pisces Moon and Scorpio Mercury—so she *feels* like a Be-er.
But every single one of those placements is **weaponized** through behavior:

* Pisces Moon fuels escapism via **action** (drugs, movement).
* Scorpio Mercury is **expressed** through stabs, not silence.
* Saturn in Capricorn doesn’t surrender—it **builds armor**.

If she were a Be-er, she’d be more like Myrtle: adaptive, emotional, quietly devoted.

---

## ✅ Final Determination: **Vivian is a Do-er**

### She solves her internal problems by:

* Breaking the system
* Running from the pain
* Sabotaging the past
* Kicking the walls until the gods fall out

Even her quiet moments (lobotomy, drugs, silence) are **actions**—desperate attempts to suppress without changing inwardly.

---

## 🎯 Thematic Power

Choosing Vivian as a **Do-er** gives ASTRO7EX a survivalist spine:

* **Meaning is chosen not by reflection, but by destruction.**
* She refuses internal reconciliation and *does* her way into wholeness.

Her **transformation isn’t personal—it’s physical**.
She doesn’t *find* the truth. She *fights* it into revealing itself.

Let me know when you’re ready to confirm this and move on to:

> 🧠 **Mental Sex** — Does Vivian approach problems from a **linear (Male)** or **holistic (Female)** cognitive perspective?
> This isn't gendered—it's **problem-solving style**.
> We’ll match that to astrology and archetypal thought.
