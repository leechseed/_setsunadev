Excellent—this question centers on **Vivian’s problem-solving style** in Dramatica terms, also known as **Mental Sex** (a concept that is *not* tied to gender, but rather cognitive orientation).

# 🧠 DRAMATICA DECISION: Main Character **Problem-Solving Style**

> Does Vivian approach problems primarily through:

* 🧠 **Logical** (linear, analytical, sequential)
* 🌊 **Intuitive** (holistic, relational, contextual)

---

## 🎯 WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS

| Style         | Key Traits                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logical**   | Sees problems as **cause-effect** sequences. Solves by identifying steps. |
| **Intuitive** | Sees problems as **systems or patterns**. Solves by sensing fit/context.  |

This decision influences *how the audience experiences her mind*:
Does she *reason through things* or does she *feel her way through webs of meaning*?

## 🪐 NARRATIVE ASTROLOGY ANALYSIS

### 🔎 Vivian's Core Astrological Cognitive Markers:

| Placement              | Cognitive Function                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ☉ **Libra Sun**        | Seeks balance, justice—tends toward **relational logic**.                      |
| 🌙 **Pisces Moon**     | Deep, emotional, porous—**intuitive sponge**, not linear thinker.              |
| ☿ **Scorpio Mercury**  | Hyper-focused, strategic, secretive—**nonlinear**, deep context-based thinker. |
| ↑ **Gemini Rising**    | Adaptive communicator, not sequential—favors **parallel narratives**.          |
| ♄ **Capricorn Saturn** | Applies structure to chaos—**logical under duress**, but not by default.       |

**Conclusion**:
Vivian thinks in layers, not ladders.
She doesn’t solve problems like a general planning a battle—she solves them like a psychic weapon wrapped in trauma, trauma wrapped in charm.

## 🌌 TRANSIT SYMBOLISM (Narrative Resonance)

* **Neptune square Mercury** → Confusion through over-intuition, not lack of logic
* **Pluto sextile Moon** → Emotional transformation via deeper pattern recognition
* **Chiron transit to Sun** → Core identity shaped through *wounding pattern*, not rational proof

These all support **intuitive, relational, emotionally-guided decision making**.

## 🧠 STORY EVIDENCE IN ASTRO7EX

| Evidence from Story                                               | Interpretation                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| She ignores orders, drifts, vanishes into cities                  | She doesn’t follow protocol—she follows **instinct**.   |
| Her allies (Nacho, Myrtle) are symbolic projections               | She **builds constellations of meaning** from feelings. |
| Her enemies (John Smith, MODS) represent control, procedure       | She fights **structure with soul**.                     |
| She never directly articulates her belief—she **acts out trauma** | Intuition driven by **emotional pattern recognition**.  |

## ❌ Why Not Logical?

While Vivian is smart and dangerous, she is not linear:

* She doesn’t break problems into steps—she charges, dodges, or breaks the entire system.
* She doesn’t follow a plan—she **intuits** next moves based on vibes, memories, emotional tides.

If she were Logical, she would sound like The Committee.
Vivian *feels* her way through madness.

---

## ✅ FINAL DETERMINATION:

### Vivian is **Intuitive**.

She is a **holistic, emotional, symbolic thinker**, not a procedural tactician.

---

## 🧩 THEME-LEVEL IMPACT

This supports:

* Her role as a **soul-fractured protagonist**, not a chess-playing rebel.
* Her rejection of both MODS (logic) and Fiona (sensual distraction) as **false maps**.
* Her **emergent wisdom**: she rediscovers purpose through pattern, not plan.
