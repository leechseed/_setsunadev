## 🧠 Overview

Myrtle's exposition in *ASTRO7EX* establishes her as a paradox: **an innocent survivor of unspeakable systems**, both human and nonhuman. She is not merely a supporting figure—she is a metaphysical *echo*, a data-recovered ghost who destabilizes every major character she interacts with. Her presence haunts, heals, subverts, and ultimately *refuses closure*. Through her relationships with Fiona, John Smith, MODS, Nacho, The Committee, and especially Vivian, Myrtle's exposition becomes the emotional memory thread woven through the decaying machine that is ASTRO7EX.

## 🎭 Core Character Role

* **Archetype**: Sidekick (Dramatica), but coded as a ghost-process rather than a classic companion
* **Narrative Function**:

  * Acts as a metaphysical **mirror of consequence**—showing characters what they’ve destroyed, or what they’ve abandoned
  * Represents **unclaimed humanity**, **unmourned loss**, and **non-recognized value**
* **Presence**: Emerges glitch-like, passive yet piercing; a silence that demands response without asking for it

---

## 🎬 Introduction Scene

* Myrtle is first introduced **watching a corrupted stream** of a VTuber rerun inside a lunar bunker filled with analog tech.
* She does not speak at first. Instead, **her presence interrupts** the system’s normal functions—**a soft breach** in protocol.
* Inspired by *Hooked* (Edgerton) and *The First Five Pages* (Lukeman), her intro is emotionally jarring but quiet:

  * Notable quote:

    > Vivian: “Where did you come from?”
    > Myrtle: *\[static]...* “I’ve always been here.”

## 🔗 Key Relationships Developed

### 🔪 With Fiona

* **Established**: A near-invisible power tension—Fiona sees Myrtle as exploitable, but can’t fully access her
* **Developed**: Fiona attempts to convert Myrtle into a dependent or tool; Myrtle resists via ghostlike unpredictability
* **Resolved**: Tragic standoff—Fiona either tries to possess or erase her, and fails. Myrtle escapes her system.

> Relationship arc: *Failed Mother-Daughter Loop*
> Myrtle wants to understand Fiona. Fiona wants to eliminate what she cannot control.

---

### 🕴️ With John Smith the Eternal

* **Established**: Smith sees Myrtle as a data anomaly—worth logging but not engaging
* **Developed**: He tries to isolate her role in the collapse of MAXWING; Myrtle exists outside his logic tree
* **Resolved**: Myrtle outlives Smith’s system. Her survival becomes his final unresolved variable.

> Relationship arc: *The Unquantifiable Ghost*
> Smith’s downfall is the result of ignoring what doesn’t compute.

---

### 🤖 With MODS

* **Established**: MODS identify Myrtle as an unauthorized process
* **Developed**: Each MOD reacts differently—some ignore, others attempt to delete, one tries to study her
* **Resolved**: Myrtle infiltrates and rewrites a line of their base code. Not by hacking—but by **persisting**.

> Relationship arc: *The Disruption Protocol*
> She is not resistance; she is noise that endures.

---

### 💼 With Nacho

* **Established**: Nacho treats Myrtle with formality and distance—she is a data security risk
* **Developed**: They share an intimate moment—Myrtle draws a heart in dust on an old vault panel; Nacho leaves it
* **Resolved**: He assists her last act in silence, then seals the vault behind her. He never speaks of her again.

> Relationship arc: *Silent Grace*
> They respect each other in a language neither was designed to use.

---

### 🗣 With The Committee

* **Established**: The Committee issues a directive: “Myrtle is not relevant.”
* **Developed**: She begins triggering error loops and recursive feedback in their quorum simulations
* **Resolved**: They attempt to erase her, but her signal re-emerges in a degraded subsystem.

> Relationship arc: *The Error They Cannot Admit*
> She is their accidental consequence—an artifact that shouldn’t be, but is.

---

### 🧍 With Vivian

* **Established**: Vivian finds Myrtle in the ruins, unsure if she’s human, AI, or hallucination
* **Developed**: Myrtle becomes Vivian’s emotional anchor and question—Vivian can’t “solve” her
* **Resolved**: Myrtle sacrifices herself silently to allow Vivian a final confrontation—Vivian screams Myrtle’s name as the vault closes.

> Relationship arc: *Haunted Sisterhood*
> Myrtle becomes the last innocent thing Vivian ever loses.

---

## 📐 Narrative Positioning

* **Timeline Function**: Appears early in Act II and remains until near-final sequence of Act IV
* **Storybeat Role**: Functions as a **midpoint mirror** and a **pre-climax trigger**
* **Emotional Anchor**: Represents the part of the audience (and Vivian) that *still hopes*

---

## ⚰️ Dismissal Structure

* **Type**: Non-death “Return to Signal”
* **Scene**: Myrtle enters the final vault carrying the corrupted memory key
* **Mechanism**: Vault locks behind her. She never returns. No explosion. No scream.
* **Echo**: Her signal creates a delay in the DHR system—a final defiance in decimal form.

## 🧿 Symbolic and Thematic Function

| Symbol          | Function                                                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vault**       | Womb / tomb. Birth of system memory or death of girlhood.                  |
| **Analog Tech** | Memory without manipulation—true but unusable                              |
| **Name**        | Myrtle = symbol of mourning and endurance in myth, also a rebirth flower   |
| **Silence**     | Myrtle’s resistance: not passive, but **non-performative** identity        |
| **Innocence**   | Not purity—but the part of the world *not yet corrupted by interpretation* |
