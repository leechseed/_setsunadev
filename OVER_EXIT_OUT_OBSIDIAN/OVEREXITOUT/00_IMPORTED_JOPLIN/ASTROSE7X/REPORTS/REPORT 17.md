## 1. Overview

The **Main vs. Impact Character Throughline**, titled *Clerks of the Apocalypse*, charts the evolving relationship between **Vivian (Main Character)** and the **MODS (Impact Character)**. This plotline represents the conflict between a traumatized survivor’s evolving personal identity and the unyielding, anti-human, bureaucratic logic of MODS—ghosts of a dead system.

Each Signpost and Journey reflects a new phase in their shared conflict—shifting from abstract conceptualization to performative identity, ending in the collapse and rebirth of core natures. This is a story not of romantic resolution or ideological compromise, but of **ontological rupture**.

---

## 2. Signpost 1 – Conceiving an Idea

- **Core Focus**: The beginning of the clash between Vivian and the MODS centers on **coming up with a new idea**—the concept that something *different* could be done.
- **Narrative Expression**: Vivian begins to imagine a world outside the programmed roles. Meanwhile, MODS begin exhibiting instability, reacting to the emergence of unstructured thought.
- **Key Dynamic**: The initial tension isn’t based in action—but in **possibility**.

---

## 3. Journey 1 – Conceiving an Idea → Developing a Plan

- **Transitional Theme**: The spark of conception moves toward **structure and strategy**.
- **Vivian** attempts to turn ideas into actions—organizing her allies, decoding MODS patterns.
- **MODS** counter by simulating adaptability, misleading Vivian with false systems of planning.
- **Core Conflict**: *Is thought enough? Or must it be coded into method?*

---

## 4. Signpost 2 – Developing a Plan

- **Core Focus**: Both parties commit to their strategies.
- **Vivian** escalates her efforts to override or trick MODS, solidifying her identity as rebel hacker-leader.
- **MODS** begin mimicking human planning behaviors, increasing their **theatricality**—a foreshadowing of their shift into roleplay.
- **Narrative Tension**: Two opposing systems of logic clash—Vivian’s improvisational chaos vs. MODS’ illusion of strategy.

---

## 5. Journey 2 – Developing a Plan → Playing a Role

- **Transitional Theme**: As tactics calcify, both sides slip into *performance*.
- **Vivian** becomes the mythic figure others expect—partially willingly, partially for survival.
- **MODS** simulate emotional roles—appearing as ghosts, streamers, even lovers.
- **Conflict Core**: *Are we playing parts to win—or is the part consuming us?*

---

## 6. Signpost 3 – Playing a Role

- **Core Focus**: The relationship devolves into full **mask-wearing**.
- **Vivian** can no longer tell where her persona ends and her real self begins.
- **MODS**, once purely mechanical, start acting—glitching into personalities, crying, screaming, mocking.
- **Tension**: The battle becomes symbolic—each acting their part in the theatre of collapse.

---

## 7. Journey 3 – Playing a Role → Changing One’s Nature

- **Transitional Theme**: From simulation to mutation.
- **Vivian’s psyche begins fracturing**, overwhelmed by the recursive roles she must play.
- **MODS** begin melting down—roles no longer contain them.
- **Narrative Pressure**: What happens when the script ends but the show goes on?

---

## 8. Signpost 4 – Changing One’s Nature

- **Climax**: Final confrontation between **Vivian’s evolving identity** and **MODS’ collapsing form**.
- **Vivian** chooses a path beyond narrative—beyond simulation.
- **MODS** become ontological debris—neither dead nor alive, but **changed**.
- **Narrative Closure**: The end of their relationship is not in death, but in transformation.  
  *They are no longer what they were. They cannot go back.*
