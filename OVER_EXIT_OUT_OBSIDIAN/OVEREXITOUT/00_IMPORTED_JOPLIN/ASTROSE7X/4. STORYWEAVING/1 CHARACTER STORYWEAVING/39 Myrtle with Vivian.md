## 🧬 Overview

The relationship between **Myrtle** and **Vivian** in *ASTRO7EX* is the emotional heartbeat of the narrative—*not because they are aligned*, but because they are **entangled**. Their bond is less about shared identity and more about spiritual gravity: Myrtle is the soul Vivian didn’t save; Vivian is the voice Myrtle never found.

At its core, their connection is **trauma mirrored through contrast**:

* Vivian is raw, loud, broken in motion.
* Myrtle is quiet, whole, broken in stillness.

Together, they form the mythic dyad of *the Wounded Soldier and the Silent Witness*. One tries to forget what she did. The other remembers everything.

## 🪞 Establishing the Relationship

**First Encounter**
Vivian discovers Myrtle in the aftermath of a MODS purge—specifically, in a burned-out lab deep within the lunar ruins of the AN7L project. Myrtle is *curled into a data socket like a fetal ghost*, eyes open, blinking on some cycle of pain that hasn’t ended. She doesn’t speak. She watches.

**Vivian’s Reaction**
At first, Vivian thinks Myrtle is just another survivor. But something in the girl’s silence unnerves her—Myrtle doesn’t react to noise, movement, or command. What she *does* react to is a memory chip Vivian accidentally drops. Myrtle picks it up... and holds it like it’s a bird’s egg.

**Relationship Catalyst**

> *Vivian: “What did they do to you?”*
> *Myrtle: (no answer)*
> *Vivian: “…Same thing they did to me, huh.”*

**Supporting Frameworks**

* **The First Five Pages** (Lukeman): Myrtle’s first appearance is crafted for maximum emotional ambiguity—an immediate hook through *presence*, not action.
* **Hooked** (Edgerton): The mystery isn’t just what happened to Myrtle—but why she seems familiar to Vivian.
* **McKee – Story**: Their inciting relationship moment is existential—two incompatible survivors trying to make sense of a third entity (the MODS system).

## 🔧 Developing the Relationship

**Reluctant Guardianship**
Vivian doesn’t want Myrtle around. She’s on the run. But Myrtle follows anyway, refusing to speak, refusing to leave. Vivian tests her—throws objects, barks orders, disappears for hours. Myrtle keeps returning, like a broken compass locked on Vivian’s position.

**Interpersonal Dynamics**

* Vivian sees Myrtle as a liability.
* Myrtle sees Vivian as a tether.
* They do not bond—they orbit.

**Emotional Fulcrum Scene**
One night, Vivian has a breakdown. Screaming, sobbing, throwing gear. Myrtle silently places a single item in front of her: the **same memory chip** from their first meeting.

> *Vivian: “I don’t want to remember.”*
> *Myrtle: “I do.”*

That line cracks everything open.

**Narrative Devices in Use**

* **Writing Deep Scenes**: The development pivots around *emotional symmetry* rather than traditional dialogue.
* **Emotional Craft (Maass)**: Myrtle does not offer comfort—she offers unbearable *clarity*. That’s the gift and the curse.
* **2000s Sci-Fi Tropes**: The Rei Ayanami x Misato Katsuragi contrast is intentional—Vivian as the broken adult, Myrtle as the haunted child.

## 🕯️ Resolving the Relationship

**Breaking Point**
Vivian eventually tries to leave Myrtle behind during the final heist prep. She believes the journey will kill the girl—or worse, corrupt her. But Myrtle disobeys. She doesn't plead or follow. She does something worse:

> *She submits a help ticket to MODS. Under Vivian’s name.*

This action triggers the final cascade in the DHR countdown.

**Final Confrontation**
When Vivian confronts her, Myrtle doesn’t cry. She doesn’t explain. She simply says:

> *“I didn’t want you to die forgotten.”*

Vivian screams. Myrtle listens. For once, Myrtle says nothing else.

**Outcome**
Their relationship ends not in reconciliation—but in a decision:

* Vivian *stays* to confront the MODS.
* Myrtle *walks into the heist site*, carrying the corrupted chip.

By the end, they are not allies.
They are not mother-daughter.
They are not enemies.

They are **the memory and the choice**.

## 📚 Intertextual & Thematic Framework

| Source                  | Application                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Harold Bloom**        | Myrtle represents Emersonian memory—transcendental, irreducible. Vivian embodies the American myth of reinvention through forgetting. |
| **Joseph Campbell**     | They are not hero and mentor, but *sacred opposites*. Myrtle is the soul-guide; Vivian is the action-avatar.                          |
| **2000s Sci-Fi**        | Think *Eureka Seven* (Renton and Eureka), or *Ghost in the Shell: SAC*—human and non-human bonded by trauma, not blood.               |
| **Narrative Astrology** | Composite: Myrtle’s Moon conjunct Vivian’s Chiron. She *activates* Vivian’s core wound.                                               |
| **Transits**            | Uranus square Mercury—*truth through disruption*. Myrtle destabilizes Vivian’s logic.                                                 |
| **Progressions**        | The relationship starts in passive Pisces energy, ends in scorched Scorpio—what was quiet becomes apocalyptic.                        |

## 🎯 Summary

Myrtle and Vivian never achieve understanding. They achieve *recognition*—the unbearable kind. The kind where two people see each other not as who they wish the other were, but as what they really are. Myrtle brings back the soul Vivian tried to bury. Vivian shows Myrtle what choice looks like—even when it hurts.

> One remembers. One decides.
> That is love, in this story.
> That is horror, too.
