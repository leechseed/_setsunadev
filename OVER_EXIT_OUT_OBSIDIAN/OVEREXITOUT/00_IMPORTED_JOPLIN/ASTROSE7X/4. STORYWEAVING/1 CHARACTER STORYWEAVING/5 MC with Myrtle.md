## 🧠 Overview

Vivian’s relationship with **Myrtle** is the **quietest, most sacred** thread in *ASTRO7EX*. Unlike the procedural terror of the MODS, the seductive delay of Fiona, or the prophetic paralysis of John Smith, **Myrtle simply stays**. She is **faith in stillness**, a figure who witnesses without judging, waits without withdrawing, and speaks only when silence has served its purpose.

Myrtle is not a motivator or obstacle. She is an **emotional axis**—Vivian’s last living reference point to **who she was before survival became her only skill**. In storyweaving terms, Myrtle is not exposition, incitement, or twist—she is **soul infrastructure**.

## 🧱 Dramatica Framework

> “The Sidekick represents unshakable faith—not in ideas, but in the protagonist themselves.”
> — *Dramatica Theory Book*

### **Functional Roles**

| Character  | Function       | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vivian** | Main Character | Proves meaning is worth choosing despite pain             |
| **Myrtle** | Sidekick       | Holds the emotional ground the world erases around Vivian |

### **Key Dramatica Elements**

* **Myrtle’s Motivation**: *Faith, Support, Feeling*
* **Myrtle’s Methodology**: *Reduction, Reevaluation, Deduction*
* **Vivian’s Drive**: To act with meaning.
* **Myrtle’s Function**: *To remind Vivian that she is already enough.*

Myrtle is **Vivian’s internal sanctuary personified**—a sidekick not of action, but of *soul continuity*.

## ✨ Establishing the Relationship

> “The most powerful relationship openings are not built on chemistry, but **witnessing**.”
> — *The First Five Pages*

Myrtle is introduced **post-trauma**, during Vivian’s recovery from her crew’s betrayal and the MODS’ silence.

### **First Scene: Faith Without Words**

* Vivian is in a decontamination tank, *dissociating*.
* Myrtle sits nearby, knees drawn up, watching her—not trying to interrupt. Just *there*.
* Hours pass. Myrtle says one thing:

  > *“You were always going to live. I just had to wait until you remembered that.”*

Vivian doesn’t respond. She doesn’t need to. Myrtle is not offering answers. She’s **holding space.**

---

## 🔥 Developing the Relationship

> “Relationships deepen not in the loud moments, but in the quiet ones we don’t explain.”
> — *Writing Deep Scenes*

The core of their development lies in Myrtle’s **constancy**. As Vivian breaks down, lashes out, gets seduced, gets hunted—**Myrtle doesn’t leave**.

### **Key Scenes of Development**

* **Scene 1**:
  Vivian panics after unlocking a corrupted memory fragment. Myrtle sits beside her. Doesn’t speak. Just lets her scream, then holds her when it’s over.

* **Scene 2**:
  Myrtle sneaks a joke into a mission briefing. Vivian doesn’t laugh—but *doesn’t leave*.

  * Myrtle:

    > *“That’s how I know you’re still in there.”*

* **Scene 3**:
  Vivian nearly gives up. Myrtle doesn’t argue. She simply opens a datachip of Vivian’s childhood training footage—the one Vivian thought she deleted.

  > *“Even back then, you were trying to protect something.”*

Myrtle’s role is *not to inspire*. It’s to **recognize**. And that recognition becomes Vivian’s deepest strength.

---

## 🧨 Resolving the Relationship

> “The resolution of a faithful relationship is not betrayal or triumph—it is **presence at the precipice**.”
> — *Hooked*

Myrtle’s final contribution is subtle—and devastating.

### **Final Scene**

* Vivian prepares to enter the final chamber to disable the DHR countdown.
* Myrtle does not stop her. Does not wish her luck.
* She clips a locket to Vivian’s wrist—the last memory fragment Myrtle extracted from the crew’s neural remains.

> *“You don’t need it. But I know you’d want to know they were with you.”*

Vivian nods.

Leaves.

Myrtle doesn’t follow.

### **Emotional Resolution**

* Myrtle’s faith is proven—not because she “helped” Vivian win, but because **she stayed without needing to be right**.
* The relationship resolves not in climax, but **completion**.
  Myrtle remains the **still point** Vivian uses to find her way back to herself.

## 📖 Literary & Mythic Support

### **Harold Bloom – The Witness Figure**

* Myrtle functions like **Ishmael in *Moby-Dick*** or **Nick Carraway in *Gatsby***—not the doer, but the **truth holder**.
* She exists to **preserve what’s real in the protagonist**, even if the protagonist cannot.

### **Joseph Campbell – The Companion Soul**

* Myrtle is **not the mentor**, nor the goddess, nor the temptress.
* She is **the tether**. The one who doesn’t leave the threshold.
* In mythic terms, she is the personification of “the self that waits.”

### **Late 2000s Sci-Fi Archetypes**

* **Yuki Nagato (Haruhi)** meets **Gowther (Seven Deadly Sins)** meets **GHOST Re-L Proxy**:

  * Soft-spoken AI/mystic observer girls who say little, but shape everything through faith, presence, and interpretive precision.
