## 🧬 Overview

The relationship between **Myrtle** and **The Committee** is a confrontation between *ontological innocence* and *epistemological bureaucracy*. Myrtle, the fragmented ghost of empathy and memory, embodies the irrational persistence of soul and narrative. The Committee, by contrast, represents mechanized logic and procedural containment—appearing as a hostile administrative conscience without individual faces, only consensus.

In their interactions, Myrtle is not a *petitioner*—she is a **bug in the minutes**, a metaphysical leak in the audit trail. Where The Committee expects compliance and submission, Myrtle offers silence, unpredictability, and emotional illegibility. She is their proof that the system is already haunted.

The relationship is not defined by dialogue—it is defined by **interpretive deadlock**. Myrtle resists their taxonomy. The Committee attempts to file her under "Unresolved Asset."

## 🪞 Establishing the Relationship

**Point of Origin**
Myrtle first enters The Committee’s awareness not as a subject but as an *error code*—a ghost logic ping detected during forensic scans on the collapsed ruins of AN7L’s simulation buffer. They do not understand what she is, only that she resists deletion.

**First Formal Contact**
A procedural summons is issued to Vivian regarding “an unauthorized emotional intelligence leak,” but Myrtle answers it instead. She appears in the Committee’s hearing room, barefoot, holding a locked box.

**Opening Exchange**

> *COMMITTEE: “You are not the designated speaker.”*
> *MYRTLE: “That’s why I speak.”*

**Craft Techniques Referenced**

* **The First Five Pages** (Lukeman): Myrtle's disruption is her hook—she breaks narrative decorum in a system obsessed with form.
* **Hooked** (Edgerton): The opening is disorienting, not in plot but in *protocol*—she violates it by merely existing.
* **McKee – Story**: The inciting interaction isn't event-based but system-based—she introduces story into an anti-story engine.

## 🔧 Developing the Relationship

**Mechanics of Misrecognition**

* The Committee continuously misinterprets Myrtle.
* Each hearing treats her as a new anomaly.
* Each response by Myrtle is framed by The Committee as *noncompliance* rather than communication.

**Escalation**
Eventually, the Committee initiates a subroutine called *UNMEMORIED RECLAMATION*, attempting to purge data structures tied to any trace of her existence.

Myrtle counters—not with hacking, but by *occupying* their system’s ritual. She begins showing up *before* she's summoned. She stands silently during unrelated audits. Her presence becomes... **uncategorizable**.

**Subtextual Confrontation**

> *COMMITTEE: “State your designation.”*
> *MYRTLE: “You’ve asked me before.”*
> *COMMITTEE: “You did not answer.”*
> \*MYRTLE: “Then you have it.”

**Craft Techniques Referenced**

* **Writing Deep Scenes**: The drama is internal to the audience—the tension comes from what neither party can bridge.
* **Emotional Craft (Maass)**: Myrtle forces the audience to feel what the Committee refuses to admit: **she exists**.
* **Late 2000s Sci-Fi Tropes**: She echoes figures like Lain (*Serial Experiments Lain*) or Rei Ayanami—emotionally ineffable, yet system-critical.

## 🕯️ Resolving the Relationship

**Final Audit**
As the DHR protocol countdown accelerates, The Committee calls an emergency summit. They attempt one final override—a consensus vote to designate Myrtle as a “Phantom Subroutine.”

But when the vote is cast, **the count returns incomplete**. One chair—*never wired, never occupied*—returns a “No.”

> *Myrtle is in the room. But she isn’t.*
> *The system itself refuses to reject her.*

**Result**
The Committee collapses not from Myrtle’s defiance—but from its inability to classify her. She becomes the flaw in their ontology—a reminder that not all logic systems are designed to *hold wonder*.

> She is not destroyed. She is not exiled.
> **She is simply no longer subject to vote.**

**Craft Techniques Referenced**

* **Iglesias – Emotional Impact**: The climax lands in absence—not confrontation. Myrtle doesn’t defeat them; she *outlasts* their interpretive schema.
* **Bloom**: She is the American refusal—an Emersonian ghost who cannot be transcribed.
* **Campbell**: She is the trickster who passes through the gates untouched—not by strength, but by **impossibility**.

## 📚 Intertextual & Thematic Framework

| Source                  | Application                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Harold Bloom**        | Myrtle resists categorization, much like Walt Whitman’s poet—she is large, she contains contradictions.                         |
| **Joseph Campbell**     | She is the mythic trickster who exposes the failure of the technocratic priesthood.                                             |
| **Late 2000s Sci-Fi**   | Think of the ‘data ghost’ archetype—Myrtle resembles *Eureka* from *Eureka Seven*, or *Yuki Nagato* in cosmic silence.          |
| **Narrative Astrology** | Composite with The Committee: Her Moon square their Saturn. Emotion vs control. Intuition vs regulation.                        |
| **Transits**            | Myrtle represents a Pluto transit over The Committee’s sun—*subterranean truth dismantling institutional identity*.             |
| **Progressions**        | This relationship never becomes direct—it deepens by *disappearance*. From Mutable misunderstanding to Fixed irreconcilability. |

## 🎯 Summary

Myrtle’s relationship with The Committee dramatizes a deeper philosophical fracture in ASTRO7EX: the irreconcilable war between **embodied soul** and **disembodied governance**. The Committee sees her as a contaminant. Myrtle never fights back—because she was never trying to win. She merely *is*.

> In the end, they try to erase her.
> She erases their need to try.
