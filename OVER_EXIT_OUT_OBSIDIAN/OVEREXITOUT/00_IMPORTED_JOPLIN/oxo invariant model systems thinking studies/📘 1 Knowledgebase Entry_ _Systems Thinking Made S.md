## Purpose

- Explain **what systems thinking is** at the level of cognition, not tools  
- Identify the **simple rules** underlying complex thought and systems  
- Enable **any person** to learn, apply, and scale systems thinking  
- Close the gap between **how the world works** and **how we think it works**

**Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 New Hope for Wicked Problems :: "Systems thinking attempts to better align how we think with how the real world works"`

---

## Scope & Constraints

- **Material type**: Book  
- **Material format**: Full text  
- **Covered**: Author-defined theory of systems thinking (DSRP), mental models, CAS, systems thinking v1.0 vs v2.0  
- **Not covered**: External critiques, alternative frameworks not discussed by the authors  
- **Assumptions**: None beyond what is explicitly stated  
- **Confidence**: High

## Executive Snapshot

### Thesis
Wicked problems persist because human thinking is misaligned with complex real-world systems; systems thinking corrects this mismatch by applying four universal cognitive rules.

**Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 New Hope for Wicked Problems :: "The root crisis is our thinking"`

### Top Claims (≤12)

1. Wicked problems arise from a mismatch between thinking and reality.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: "Wicked problems result from the mismatch"`

2. Systems thinking is fundamentally about **thinking**, not tools.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "systems is an adjective describing the noun, thinking"`

3. Complex systems are governed by **simple rules**.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "underneath complex things are simple rules"`

4. DSRP are the four universal rules of systems thinking.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: "Four Simple Rules of Systems Thinking"`

5. Mental models mediate all interaction with reality.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "Everything we think is a mental model"`

6. Feedback aligns or invalidates mental models.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "the real world gives us feedback"`

7. Systems thinking itself is a complex adaptive system.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "SYSTEMS THINKING IS A COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEM"`

8. Systems thinking must be democratized to work.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: "we need better citizens who think systemically"`

## PSTO — Policy / Strategy / Tactics / Operations

### Policy
- Human survival and problem-solving depend on improving thinking quality.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: "To save our planet... we need better citizens"`

### Strategy
- Teach universal cognitive rules instead of specialized tools.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "we confuse tools for skills"`

### Tactics
- Use visual mapping to externalize thinking.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Second Edition Note :: "visual grammar for human thought processes"`

### Operations
- Apply DSRP repeatedly in daily reasoning and problem-solving.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: "there is no substitute for daily practice"`

---

## OODA — Observe / Orient / Decide / Act

### Observe
- Notice mismatches between expectation and outcome.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "Whenever the behavior of a system surprises us"`

### Orient
- Examine mental models shaping perception.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "We understand the real world through mental models"`

### Decide
- Revise or replace models based on feedback.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "this feedback helps us adapt"`

### Act
- Test revised models in the real world.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "we try it out in the real world"`

---

## DSRP — Distinctions / Systems / Relationships / Perspectives

### Distinctions
- Any idea can be separated from what it is not.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: "DISTINCTIONS RULE"`

### Systems
- Any idea can be decomposed into parts or wholes.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: "SYSTEMS RULE"`

### Relationships
- Any idea can relate to other ideas.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: "RELATIONSHIP RULE"`

### Perspectives
- Any idea can be viewed from a point of view.  
  **Evidence (location cue)**: `Section 1 :: "PERSPECTIVES RULE"`

## Core Concepts (≤30)

1. **Wicked Problems** — Problems characterized by complexity and disagreement.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 1 :: "Wicked Problems involve"`

2. **Mental Model** — A representation of reality used to guide action.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "Everything we think is a mental model"`

3. **Feedback** — Information from reality that validates or refutes models.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "the real world gives us feedback"`

4. **Complex Adaptive System (CAS)** — A system that adapts through feedback.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "Complex Adaptive System (CAS)"`

5. **Systems Thinking v1.0** — Tool-focused, pluralistic phase.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "systems thinking version 1.0"`

6. **Systems Thinking v2.0** — Cognition-centered, rule-based phase.  
   **Evidence (location cue)**: `Chapter 2 :: "systems thinking v2.0"`
