-  The Midnight clan is a group/crew/family of outliers on the hovership (hovercraft) PSP Fella. 
- PSP Fella is one ship of many in a salvage flotilla 'Palmetto Salvage Partners' an Ashcroft Company. 
- Their way of life is to salvage valuable space technology that rains down from the kessler syndrome storm that has surrounded the earth for the last 50 years. They live on a company wage system where they are paid according to how the company dictates (not on value of loot) but on the arbitrary system of hours worked. They get Ashcroft Company Credits to which they are able to then purchase basic necessities and upgrades etc. 
	- The whole schtick with this is that they fit in and only function within the system that Ashcroft built. 
- There are 4 arcs within this one movement known as movement 1 purple origins. 
	- movement 1.1 - Tori finds a 'vaccum tube assembly' a priceless hand blown one of a kind analog circuit security AI key. Basically it allows the user to start up various pre-kessler AI's. Honestly the power is unfathomably uknown. Because anything that has anything to do with pre-kessler AI is absolute power. 
	- movement 1.2 - Tori convinces the crew of the fella to break away from PSP to sell directly to Ashcroft Corporation for themselves. To get rich and to hopefully stop living a life of servitude. 
	- movement 1.3 - Fella embarks on 'a land remembered'/mad max journey running away from the the PSP flotilla, rouge bandits, and the like. They get away cleanly but that all changes when they cross the outer ring into the inner area of Delta Coast proper 
	- movement 1.4 Ashcroft destroys and kills all members of Fella, but in her final moments, Tori is flashed forward to a holding cell, as if she is in a different life or different dimension.
