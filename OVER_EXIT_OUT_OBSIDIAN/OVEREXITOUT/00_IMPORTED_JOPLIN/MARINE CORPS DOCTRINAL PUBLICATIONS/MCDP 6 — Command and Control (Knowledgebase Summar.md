# MCDP 6 — Command and Control (Knowledgebase Summary)

## Abstract
MCDP 6, *Command and Control*, establishes the Marine Corps’ doctrinal understanding of command and control as the means by which commanders translate intent into coordinated action in the face of uncertainty, friction, and a thinking enemy. It argues that command and control is fundamentally a human and cognitive endeavor, not a technical or procedural one. The publication defines command and control as the exercise of authority and direction through leadership, decisionmaking, and communication, explains its relationship to tempo and initiative, and emphasizes decentralization guided by commander’s intent. It demands judgment, trust, shared understanding, and disciplined initiative to function effectively in war.

## TL;DR
- Command and control exists to enable coordinated action under uncertainty.
- Command and control is primarily a human activity, not a technical system.
- Centralized decisionmaking and decentralized execution are essential.
- Commander’s intent provides unity of effort amid chaos.
- Information supports command but does not replace judgment.
- Tempo is generated through effective command and control.
- Friction and uncertainty cannot be eliminated, only managed.
- Trust and shared understanding are prerequisites for decentralization.
- Technology must support, not dominate, command and control.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### Foreword / Preface
- Command and control is central to all military action.
- War’s uncertainty makes perfect control impossible.
- Effective command and control emphasizes leadership and judgment.

### Chapter 1 — The Nature of Command and Control
This chapter defines command and control and explains its foundations.

#### Command and Control Defined
- Command and control is the exercise of authority and direction.
- It enables coordinated action toward a common purpose.
- Command and control links decisionmaking to execution.

#### Command and Control and War
- War is characterized by uncertainty, friction, and opposition.
- Command and control must function despite imperfect information.
- Attempts at total control are counterproductive.

#### Human Factors
- People are central to command and control.
- Judgment, experience, and intuition shape decisions.
- Morale and cohesion affect effectiveness.

### Chapter 2 — Command
This chapter focuses on the nature of command.

#### Authority and Responsibility
- Command is rooted in lawful authority.
- Responsibility cannot be delegated.
- Commanders are accountable for outcomes.

#### Leadership and Judgment
- Leadership guides action under uncertainty.
- Judgment compensates for incomplete information.
- Command requires moral courage.

#### Commander’s Intent
- Intent expresses purpose and desired end state.
- Intent guides subordinate decisions.
- Clear intent enables decentralized execution.

### Chapter 3 — Control
This chapter explains how control supports command.

#### Control Defined
- Control regulates forces and activities.
- Control provides coordination and coherence.
- Control must not stifle initiative.

#### Decentralization
- Decentralization delegates decisionmaking authority.
- Subordinates act within intent.
- Trust enables effective decentralization.

#### Feedback and Adjustment
- Control relies on feedback.
- Adjustment is continuous.
- Adaptation sustains effectiveness.

### Chapter 4 — Information and Communication
This chapter addresses information’s role in command and control.

#### Information in Command and Control
- Information reduces uncertainty but does not eliminate it.
- Information must be relevant and timely.
- Excess information can hinder decisions.

#### Communication
- Communication conveys intent and guidance.
- Simplicity enhances understanding.
- Reliability is more important than volume.

#### Technology
- Technology supports command and control.
- Technology cannot replace human judgment.
- Overreliance increases vulnerability.

### Chapter 5 — Command and Control in Practice
This chapter integrates theory with application.

#### Tempo and Initiative
- Effective command and control generates tempo.
- Initiative exploits opportunity.
- Tempo disrupts enemy decisionmaking.

#### Friction and Uncertainty
- Friction degrades plans and coordination.
- Command and control mitigates, not removes, friction.
- Flexibility is essential.

#### Command and Control Across the Spectrum of Conflict
- Command and control applies in all types of operations.
- Different contexts require different approaches.
- Core principles remain constant.

## Mental Models

### Model 1 — Intent-Driven Control
- **Model:** Clear intent guides decentralized action.
- **Use:** Enables initiative under changing conditions.

### Model 2 — Human-Centered Command
- **Model:** Judgment outweighs systems and procedures.
- **Use:** Prevents overreliance on technology.

### Model 3 — Centralized Decisions, Decentralized Execution
- **Model:** Unity of purpose with freedom of action.
- **Use:** Balances control and flexibility.

### Model 4 — Tempo as Advantage
- **Model:** Faster decision cycles create opportunity.
- **Use:** Guides command focus on speed and coherence.

## Argument Map
- **Claim 1:** War is uncertain and resistant to control.
  - **Therefore:** Command and control must manage, not eliminate, uncertainty.
- **Claim 2:** Human judgment is central to decisionmaking.
  - **Therefore:** Command and control is fundamentally a human activity.
- **Claim 3:** Excessive control suppresses initiative.
  - **Therefore:** Decentralization guided by intent is required.
- **Claim 4:** Information and technology are imperfect.
  - **Therefore:** They must support, not replace, leadership.
- **Conclusion:** Effective command and control enables coordinated action by combining intent, judgment, trust, and adaptation.
