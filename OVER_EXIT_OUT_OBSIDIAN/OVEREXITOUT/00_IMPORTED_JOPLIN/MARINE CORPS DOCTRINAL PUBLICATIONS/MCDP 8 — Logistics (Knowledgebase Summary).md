# MCDP 8 — Logistics (Knowledgebase Summary)

## Abstract
MCDP 8, *Logistics*, establishes the Marine Corps’ doctrinal understanding of logistics as a decisive enabler of combat power rather than a supporting afterthought. It argues that logistics is integral to operations, inseparable from maneuver and command, and essential to sustaining tempo and freedom of action in war. The publication defines logistics in operational terms, explains its relationship to uncertainty, friction, and decisionmaking, and emphasizes the need for responsiveness, adaptability, and integration with tactical and operational plans. It demands that commanders treat logistics as a command responsibility and plan for sustainment as deliberately as for combat.

## TL;DR
- Logistics directly enables combat power and operational tempo.
- Logistics is an integral part of operations, not a separate function.
- Uncertainty and friction dominate logistical environments.
- Responsiveness and adaptability are more important than efficiency alone.
- Logistics must support maneuver and initiative.
- Commanders are responsible for logistical effectiveness.
- Sustainment shapes what operations are possible.
- Logistics planning must anticipate change and disruption.
- Successful operations depend on the continuous flow of support.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### Foreword / Preface
- Logistics is fundamental to combat effectiveness.
- Sustainment enables operational freedom of action.
- Commanders must integrate logistics into all planning.

### Chapter 1 — The Nature of Logistics
This chapter defines logistics and explains its role in war.

#### Logistics Defined
- Logistics encompasses the sustainment of forces.
- Logistics supports forces before, during, and after operations.
- Logistics includes supply, maintenance, transportation, and services.

#### Logistics and War
- War creates uncertainty and disruption in sustainment.
- Logistics must function despite friction and enemy action.
- Predictability in logistics is limited.

#### Logistics and Combat Power
- Combat power depends on sustained support.
- Logistical failure limits operational options.
- Sustainment shapes operational reach.

### Chapter 2 — Principles of Logistics
This chapter outlines guiding principles for logistical support.

#### Responsiveness
- Logistics must respond rapidly to operational needs.
- Speed often outweighs efficiency.
- Delay degrades combat effectiveness.

#### Simplicity
- Simple systems reduce friction.
- Clarity improves coordination.
- Complexity increases vulnerability.

#### Flexibility
- Logistics must adapt to changing conditions.
- Plans must anticipate disruption.
- Flexibility preserves sustainment under stress.

#### Economy
- Resources are finite.
- Waste reduces operational endurance.
- Economy supports sustainability.

#### Attainability and Sustainability
- Objectives must be logistically achievable.
- Sustainment must be continuous.
- Logistics enables prolonged operations.

### Chapter 3 — Logistics in Operations
This chapter explains how logistics supports operational execution.

#### Integration with Operations
- Logistics and operations are inseparable.
- Sustainment must support scheme of maneuver.
- Coordination enables effectiveness.

#### Logistics and Maneuver
- Maneuver depends on supply and movement.
- Logistical constraints shape maneuver options.
- Mobility requires sustained support.

#### Logistics and Tempo
- Tempo depends on continuous sustainment.
- Disruptions slow operations.
- Effective logistics preserves momentum.

### Chapter 4 — Command and Logistics
This chapter addresses leadership and control of logistics.

#### Command Responsibility
- Commanders are responsible for logistics.
- Sustainment decisions affect operational success.
- Logistics cannot be delegated entirely.

#### Planning and Coordination
- Logistical planning must occur early.
- Coordination integrates sustainment and maneuver.
- Planning must anticipate change.

#### Decentralization and Control
- Decentralized execution improves responsiveness.
- Control ensures coherence and support.
- Balance is required.

## Mental Models

### Model 1 — Logistics as Combat Power
- **Model:** Sustainment directly enables operational action.
- **Use:** Reinforces logistics as a decisive factor.

### Model 2 — Responsiveness Over Efficiency
- **Model:** Speed and adaptability outweigh perfect efficiency.
- **Use:** Guides decisions under uncertainty.

### Model 3 — Sustainment Shapes Possibility
- **Model:** What can be sustained defines what can be done.
- **Use:** Informs operational planning.

### Model 4 — Integrated Operations and Logistics
- **Model:** Logistics and maneuver function as a single system.
- **Use:** Prevents separation of planning and execution.

## Argument Map
- **Claim 1:** Combat power depends on continuous sustainment.
  - **Therefore:** Logistics is integral to operations.
- **Claim 2:** War disrupts predictable supply and support.
  - **Therefore:** Logistics must be flexible and adaptive.
- **Claim 3:** Operational tempo requires uninterrupted support.
  - **Therefore:** Responsiveness is decisive.
- **Claim 4:** Sustainment decisions shape operational options.
  - **Therefore:** Commanders must own logistics.
- **Conclusion:** Effective logistics enables freedom of action by sustaining combat power under uncertainty.
