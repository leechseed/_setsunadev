## 2. Dramatica Structural Spine

### Motivation

- **Faith:** Desperate faith that helping Victoria will "Re-render" her own deleted self.
    
- **Support:** Acts as the technical scaffolding for the "Outlier" diaspora.
    

### Methodology

- **Deduction:** High-speed data correlation.
    
- **Reduction:** Stripping the Feed’s "Hero Narrative" down to its bone-dry corpse.
    

### Evaluation

- **Effect:** Does this data-leak hurt the Administration?
    
- **Possibility:** Exploring alternate timelines where she and Quinn stayed dead.
    

### Purpose

- **Knowledge:** Recovering the "Human Noise" the system tried to archive.
    
- **Actuality:** Moving from the curated lie to the visceral "Fire" memory.
    

**Structural Meaning:** Riley is the detective of her own murder. She operates on the "Faith" that Truth exists beneath the Feed, even if that Truth proves she is no longer human.

## 3. Movement 4 Origin Commitments (LOCKED)

### System Function (The Witness)

- **The Record-Keeper:** Riley’s official job is to ensure the "Official Record" overwrites the "Truth."
    
- **The Propagandist:** She writes the hero-code for Quinn while secretly auditing the anomalies.
    

### Core Vulnerability

- **Dominant:** Survivor’s Guilt (Toxic Proximity to Quinn).
    
- **The Splinter:** The "Breaking Point." A tiny, painful wood splinter pushes itself out of her skin; the wound heals instantly. This sensory glitch proves she is hardware—not "Miracle."
    

### System’s Interest in Her

- Riley is the only witness to Quinn's death. She is the **Variable of Exposure**. The system (Anna) keeps her close to monitor the decay of her "Curated Memories."
    

---

## 4. Behavior Under Pressure

- **Manic Noir:** Speaks in rapid-fire data points mixed with stylized, "Brick"-esque hard-boiled slang (e.g., "The Feed’s got a heavy hand tonight," "Tori’s racing for a ghost-pink slip").
    
- **Digital Paranoia:** Scans for "Signal" while terrified of being "Archived."
    
- **Fact-Checking Reality:** Constantly cross-references what she _sees_ with what the system _logs_.
    

---

## 5. Relationship to the System

- **The Ghost Inhabitant:** Feels like a phantom living in a life she didn't earn.
    
- **The Subversive Scribe:** Uses her position in the propaganda wing to bury "breadcrumbs" for Victoria.
    
- **The Shared Grave:** Her link to Quinn is toxic because they are both "Living Lies" maintained by the same Engine (Anna).
    

**Canonical Principle:** Riley represents the **Failure of Erasure**. No matter how clean the Feed is, the "Human Noise" always pushes through.

---

## 6. The Miracle Glitch (Memory Cost)

|**Attribute**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|**The Incident**|The Explosion (M6 Future Point)|
|**The Reality**|Quinn and Riley were physically destroyed.|
|**The Record**|A "Miracle" survival / Medal of Honor narrative.|
|**The Sensory Leak**|The smell of chemical fire and the instant-healing splinter.|

---

## 7. Non-Negotiables (Character Laws)

Riley will not:

- Trust Quinn’s "Hero" record.
    
- Stop fact-checking the Feed until she finds her original "Death Log."
    
- Betray Victoria’s location to Anna, even under "Administrative Audit."
    

---

## 8. Signature Imagery / Vibe

- **The Data-Wraith:** Multiple screens reflecting on a pale face; bloodshot eyes hidden by high-tech "verified" glare.
    
- **High-Anxiety Tech-Noir:** Caffeine-shakes, blue-lit rooms, stylized "Brick" dialogue delivered in a frantic _Mr. Robot_ whisper.
    
- **Symbolism:** A wood splinter preserved in a digital slide—the proof that she is a lie.
    

---

## 9. Continuity Bridge — Movement 4

Movement 4 is where the **Detective** arc begins.

|**Phase**|**Function**|
|---|---|
|**M4 — Awakening**|Riley detects the "Tori" anomaly and realizes the Delta Coast was a capture protocol.|
|**M6 — Collapse**|Riley broadcasts the "Real" record of the Miracle Glitch, ending Quinn’s legibility.|

---

## 10. Structural Summary

Riley Moss is **The Detective of the Void**.

She is a baddie built from wreckage, using the system's own propaganda tools to hunt down the truth of her own expiration date. She doesn't just want the truth—she wants to see the system's math fail.

### 🪐 Professional Consultation: The "Noir-Robot" Dialect

To make the _Brick_ lean work, we need to lock her specific "Slang" for the system.

- **"The Big Chill"** = The Administration.
    
- **"Feds on the Feed"** = Surveillance algorithms.
    

- **"Ghosting the Gate"** = Victoria's ability to remain un-detectable.
    

**Would you like me to map the first interaction between Riley and Quinn, focusing on the Survivor's Guilt tension and the "Splinter" revelation?**
