Do it in **two passes**: **(A) extract canon from Dramatica**, then **(B) fuse in your loose notes** _only where they don’t contradict_. Step-by-step, no fluff.

---

## Step 1 — Pick the cast list (4–7 names)

Reply with the **exact list** of characters you want to “core-doc” first.

Example: `Tori, Anna, Quinn, Hunter, Penny, [Brother name], Montgomery`

(No bios. Just names.)

Victoria 'Tori' Midnight,

## Step 2 — For Character #1 only, paste the Dramatica outputs that are actually structural

For the first character on your list, paste **only** these Dramatica fields (copy/paste from the program):

1. **Archetype / Role** (Protagonist / Antagonist / Guardian / Contagonist / Reason / Emotion / Sidekick / Skeptic — or whatever you set)
    
2. **Motivation** (the 4 items: _Pursuit, Avoid, Consider, Reconsider_)
    
3. **Methodology** (_Proaction, Reaction, Inaction, Protection_)
    
4. **Evaluation** (_Logic, Feeling, Control, Uncontrolled_)
    
5. **Purpose** (_Knowledge, Thought, Ability, Desire_)
    
6. **Problem + Solution** (the pair)
    
7. **Focus + Direction** (the pair)
    
8. **Unique Ability + Critical Flaw** (if you assigned them)
    

That’s it.

If you don’t have one of those set, write `UNSET`.

---

## Step 3 — Paste your loose notes for that same character (but only in 5 buckets)

Under the same character, paste your loose notes **sorted** into these buckets (even if messy):

- **Behavior under pressure** (what they do)
    
- **Relationship to the system** (how they relate to power/enforcement)
    
- **Core bond / attachment** (who they orbit, who they replace)
    
- **Non-negotiables** (what they won’t do / what they must do)
    
- **Signature imagery / vibe** (optional)
    

If you can’t sort it fast, paste raw and label it `RAW NOTES`.

---

## Step 4 — I produce the “Minimum Authoritative Character Doc”

I will output a **single canonical document** for that character that includes:

- Dramatica alignment summary (no invention)
    
- Your “7-field minimum authority” spine
    
- Contradictions list (if any) with a **tie-break rule**
    
- What Movement-origins are plausible (not locked yet)
    

---

## Step 5 — Repeat for Character #2

Same exact process. One at a time.

---

### Tie-break rule (important, so we don’t drift)

- **Dramatica fields win** for _role/function/psychodynamics_ **unless you explicitly say “override Dramatica.”**
    
- **Your invariants win** over everything.
    
- Loose notes fill in **expression**, not structure.

## Your next message should be ONLY Step 1 + Step 2 for Character #1

So reply with:

1. The cast list (Step 1)
    
2. Character #1 Dramatica fields (Step 2)
    

And we start.
