SYSTEM AUDIT: Extract all technical specifications regarding the simulation engine and visual mechanics. Focus on: 1. GURPS-based math, "Tick Engine" logic, and behavioral resolution loops. 2. The Kill la Kill (KLK) Framework: specific rules for "Clothing as Rank," "Star-ratings," and "Biometric Transparency." 3. Cinematic Proceduralism: The "Fincher Protocol," robotic panning, axis-bound movement, and movement-specific color palettes (e.g., Jaundice Yellow). 4. Character Sheet output schemas (JSON/YAML structures). 5. The "Ascendant as UI Skin" logic from the Astrology-Interface. Extract only hard variables, logic gates, and systemic invariants. Output as a Technical Specification Library.
