# 📋 MOVEMENT 1 (PURPLE) EXTRACTION LIST

## 1. The Human Baseline (Victoria & Brother)

- **The Relationship**: What is the specific power dynamic between Victoria and her brother? Is he the "Brains" (The Mechanic/Navigator) while she is the "Body" (The Pilot)?
    
- **The "Pace Notes"**: You mentioned the pace notes earlier. Are these purely technical, or do they contain "Human Noise" (inside jokes, personal shorthand)? This is the "Meaning" that the System will later try to erase.
    
- **The Talent**: What makes Victoria an "Outlier" at this stage? Is it her reaction time, her lack of fear, or a specific way she "hears" the machine?
    

## 2. The Southern Gothic Environment (The Delta Coast)

- **The Race Culture**: Who are they racing against? Is this a legal circuit, or a "Banned" underground scene?
    
- **The Stakes**: What happens if they lose? Is this about money, debt, or just the pure "Freedom" of not being on the Feed?
    
- **The Local Power**: Who is the "King" of the Delta Coast before the Bishops arrive?
    

## 3. The Systemic Intrusion (The Filter)

- **The First Contact**: How does the Racing Guild (The Bishops) first notice her? Do they send a scout, or is it a digital "Flag" in the racing data?
    
- **Quinn’s Role**: If Quinn is the "Filter" here, what is his first physical interaction with her? Does he watch from the shadows, or does he "Ban" someone she loves first?
    
- **The "Fowler" Factor**: You mentioned "Fowler" and "Montgomery" in your notes. What is their specific role in Movement 1? Are they the ones who rig the final crash?
    

## 4. The Incident (The Fatal Crash)

- **The Trigger**: What actually causes the crash? Is it mechanical failure, a deliberate hit by another driver, or a "System Override" from a remote signal?
    
- **The Fire**: Why is the fire significant? Does it physically "clear the slate" for her transformation into an Asset?
    
- **The Brother's Fate**: What happens to him in the moment of the crash? Does Victoria believe he is dead?
    

## 5. The Acquisition

- **The Salvage**: Who pulls her from the wreckage?
    
- **The Choice**: Is there a moment of "Consent," or is her body simply "Claimed" as proprietary salvage because she was "Banned/Noise"?
