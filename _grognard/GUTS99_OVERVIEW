# 🧠 GUTS99 — Grand Unified Tone & Style

> A Master System for Mapping the Aesthetic, Emotional, and Structural DNA of All Media

---

## 📘 Overview

**GUTS99 (Grand Unified Tone & Style)** is a recursive, modular framework for analyzing, cataloging, and deploying your personal media influences across _all_ forms of input: film, anime, games, porn, art, sound, and beyond. It transforms vague inspiration into structured metadata. Solo creators, archivists, and stylistic obsessives alike can build a personal _Style Engine_ from the ground up—with enough depth for grognards and enough elegance for obsessive minimalists.

## 🧩 Core System Architecture

Each major media domain is interpreted through a _subsystem_—a name derived from the metaphorical body part it expresses. Every subsystem is tagged using `#SUBSYSTEM` for fast querying and cross-referencing.

| Subsystem Name | Tag           | Domain / Media Type                         | Backronym                                                             | Name Origin Context                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VISCERA        | `#VISCERA`    | Film / TV                                   | Visual Identity System for Cinematic Expression, Rhythm, and Affect   | Evokes guts, rawness, and emotional core of cinema                                 |
| NEOGUTS        | `#NEOGUTS`    | Anime                                       | Narrative-Emotional Otaku Grammar Using Tonal Schemata                | "Neo" for modern anime grammar; "Guts" nods to visceral anime like _Berserk_       |
| LYMPH          | `#LYMPH`      | Literature                                  | Lexical Yield Mapping for Prose and Hermeneutics                      | Like lymphatic system: slow, distributed, nourishing hidden systems like footnotes |
| LUDOVORE       | `#LUDOVORE`   | Games                                       | Ludonarrative Dynamics of Velocity, Objectives, Ritual, and Emergence | A ‘game-eater’; metaphor for deep consumption of play systems                      |
| AUDIVA         | `#AUDIVA`     | Music / Sound Design                        | Aural Dynamics of Identity, Voice, and Affect                         | Portmanteau of “audio” + “diva,” implying sonic seduction                          |
| LUSTRA         | `#LUSTRA`     | Porn / Erotica                              | Libidinal Unification of Style, Tone, Ritual, and Anatomy             | Derived from "lust" and "illustra" (Latin: illuminate)—porn as sacred light        |
| OCULON         | `#OCULON`     | Visual Art / Symbolism                      | Optical Composition Underlying Line, Order, and Narrative             | Sounds like ocular + cyclotron—vision in motion, spiraling meaning                 |
| TENDRA         | `#TENDRA`     | Web Lore / Meme Culture / Network Theory    | Temporal Expression of Networked Discourse, Ritual, and Affect        | From "tendril," spreading, rhizomatic discourse systems                            |
| EPOCHE         | `#EPOCHE`     | Theater / Live Performance / Actor Ritual   | Embodied Performance Of Conflict, Hysteria, and Emotion               | From phenomenology: “epoché” = suspension of judgment; pure performance            |
| PANELOS        | `#PANELOS`    | Manga / Comics / Sequential Narrative       | Panel Aesthetics and Narrative Encoding for Layout, Order, and Symbol | From “panel” + “logos”; comics as symbolic arrangement                             |
| MYOFLEX        | `#MYOFLEX`    | Movement / Choreography / Kinesthetic Logic | Myographic Yield Of Form, Limb, Expression, and Xpression             | "Myo" = muscle; "Flex" = kinetic motion and signal                                 |
| VERBOMANCY     | `#VERBOMANCY` | Voice / Rhetoric / Linguistic Design        | Verbal Encoding for Rhetoric, Body, Oratory, Manipulation, and Syntax | “Word magic”; power of speech to conjure ideology or seduction                     |

## 🧱 Logging a Media Entry

Each piece of media gets logged in Markdown (or JSON) with shared metadata. You may apply one or multiple subsystems per entry:

```markdown
## 🎞️ Title: [Media Title Here]

- **Medium**: (Film, Game, Anime, Porn, etc.)
- **Primary Influence Type**: (Aesthetic / Structural / Emotional / Erotic / Philosophical / Technical)
- **Core Imprint**: [Short one-liner on what it injected into your psyche]
- **Tags**: [#VISCERA #NEOGUTS #tonal-collapse #looped-affect]
- **Subsystem Profiles**:
  - VISCERA: [optional notes]
  - NEOGUTS: [...]
  - LUSTRA: [...]
```

---

## 🧬 Style Archetypes

Once media is accumulated, recurring combinations form **Style Archetypes**:

```markdown
### 🦠 Archetype: Erotic Dread Collapse

- **Core Mood**: Erotic submission amid metaphysical horror
- **Works**: _Silent Hill 2_, _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, _Antichrist_
- **Best Used For**: Psychological degeneration, submissive hauntings, faith-as-pain
- **Dominant Subsystems**: #LUSTRA + #NEOGUTS + #AUDIVA + #OCULON
```

---

## 🧠 Personal Style Engine

When the database hits critical mass, you may synthesize your full creative imprint:

```markdown
# 🧠 Style Engine: [Your Handle or Persona]

- **Dominant Narrative Forms**: Recursive collapse, fragment drift, ritualized decision
- **Mood Signatures**: Grief looped as sex, silence as tension, grotesque reverence
- **Erotic Signaling**: Prolonged edging, gape as worship, totalizing submission
- **Stylistic Dependencies**: #VISCERA + #LUSTRA + #LYMPH
- **Top Referenced Works**: [insert media titles]
```

## 📁 Suggested File Structure (if using folders)

```bash
GUTS99/
├── VISCERA/
├── NEOGUTS/
├── LYMPH/
├── LUDOVORE/
├── AUDIVA/
├── LUSTRA/
├── OCULON/

├── EPOCHE/
├── PANELOS/
├── MYOFLEX/
├── VERBOMANCY/
├── archetypes/
├── style-engines/
├── templates/
└── README.md
```

Or, skip the folders and log everything as flat Markdown with **#tag-based filtering** in Obsidian, Notion, or your own terminal viewer.

- 🗂 Building a private database of all personal aesthetic influence

---

## 🏁 Next Actions

- [ ] Continue populating entries for each subsystem
- [ ] Begin tagging emerging archetypes from clusters
- [ ] Cross-ref with project timelines (e.g. **ASTRO7EX**, **Lustration**)
- [ ] Build personal graph of cross-subsystem affect (e.g., using Mermaid or Obsidian)
