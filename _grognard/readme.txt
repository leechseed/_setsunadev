## 📘 Overview

**GUTS99** is a media-agnostic system for analyzing the emotional, structural, and aesthetic DNA of the works that influence you.  
It’s built for solo creators who want a *streamlined, grognard-level tool* to map their internal style landscape.

Think of it as your **personal mythos engine**—modular, recursive, expandable, and tightly formatted.

## 🧩 Subsystem Modules

Each media format is mapped through a dedicated recursive acronym—these act like *organs* of the GUTS99 body:

## 🛠️ Use Cases

* Creative self-auditing / taste codification
* Narrative or stylistic reference for worldbuilding
* Clustering works by *aesthetic resonance*
* Building input datasets for GPT agents, AI characters, or prompts
* Weaponizing porn taste for world/character design
* Mapping which works shaped your projects (e.g. ASTRO7EX)

## 🚧 In Progress

* [ ] JSON/CSV/SQLite export layer
* [ ] Mermaid charts for style clustering
* [ ] CLI script to create entries by tag
* [ ] Personal AI assistant integration
* [ ] Tag cloud frequency heatmaps

## 👁️ Philosophy

> **You are what you absorb.**
> GUTS99 turns passive influence into *active architecture*.
> It’s not a moodboard—it’s a *combat log* for your taste.
