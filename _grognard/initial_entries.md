## üß† Minimum for Core Profile:

- **30‚Äì40 entries total** across all subsystems = you start seeing **emergent clusters** and **stylistic archetypes**.
- Go beyond 50, and your **personal aesthetic OS** becomes predictive.

---

## ‚úÖ You Currently Have:

- ‚úî 1 entry for each subsystem (baseline ‚úÖ)
- ‚è≥ Next step: Build up to target ranges using the same tag-based entry format
