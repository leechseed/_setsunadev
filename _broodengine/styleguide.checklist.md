### Step-by-Step Checklist for Markdown Documentation with Hierarchical Naming, Frontmatter, and LLM Ingestion

#### 1. **Set Up Hierarchical Naming Conventions**
- [ ] Organize your files into a clear directory structure.
- [ ] Use descriptive folder and file names that reflect the content hierarchy.

**Example:**
```markdown
/Engine
    /Physics
        collision.md
        rigidbody.md
    /Audio
        sound.md
        music.md
    /Lighting
        shadows.md
        globalillumination.md
```

#### 2. **Include Frontmatter Metadata**
- [ ] Add frontmatter at the beginning of each Markdown file.
- [ ] Include key metadata fields: title, tags, system, subsystem, version, summary, date.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Collision Detection"
tags: ["physics", "collision"]
system: "Physics"
subsystem: "Collision"
version: "1.2"
summary: "Overview of the collision detection system in the physics engine."
date: "2024-05-24"
---
```

#### 3. **Maintain Consistent Structure**
- [ ] Use consistent Markdown formatting for headers, lists, code blocks, etc.
- [ ] Ensure each document follows a similar structure.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Collision Detection

## Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

## Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

## Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

#### 4. **Use Explicit Section Delimiters**
- [ ] Mark sections clearly using headers or custom markers.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Collision Detection

<!-- Section: Introduction -->
## Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

<!-- Section: Algorithms -->
## Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

<!-- Section: Optimization -->
## Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

#### 5. **Add Inline Annotations and Comments**
- [ ] Provide additional context or explanations using inline comments.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Collision Detection

<!-- 
This section covers the basics of collision detection, including algorithms and optimization techniques.
The content is divided into the following subsections:
1. Introduction
2. Algorithms
3. Optimization
-->

## Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...
```

#### 6. **Use Standardized Terminology**
- [ ] Create and follow a glossary of standardized terms.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Glossary"
tags: ["reference", "terminology"]
---

# Glossary

## Collision Detection

The process of detecting when two or more physical objects in a game environment intersect or come into contact...

## Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

A data structure used to accelerate collision detection by organizing objects into a tree of bounding volumes...
```

#### 7. **Prepare Data Formatting for LLM Ingestion**
- [ ] Ensure the content is well-structured and clean.
- [ ] Use consistent formatting and tokenization.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Collision Detection"
tags: ["physics", "collision"]
system: "Physics"
subsystem: "Collision"
version: "1.2"
summary: "Overview of the collision detection system in the physics engine."
---

# Collision Detection

## Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

## Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

## Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

#### 8. **Use Contextual Embeddings**
- [ ] Add embeddings to capture the meaning and relationships between different parts of the text.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Collision Detection"
tags: ["physics", "collision"]
system: "Physics"
subsystem: "Collision"
version: "1.2"
summary: "Overview of the collision detection system in the physics engine."
embeddings: ["collision detection", "BVH", "optimization"]
---
```

#### 9. **Segment Content**
- [ ] Break large documents into smaller, manageable chunks.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Collision Detection

## Part 1: Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

## Part 2: Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

## Part 3: Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

#### 10. **Track Versions and Updates**
- [ ] Use version control systems like Git.
- [ ] Maintain a changelog for each document.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Collision Detection"
tags: ["physics", "collision"]
system: "Physics"
subsystem: "Collision"
version: "1.2"
summary: "Overview of the collision detection system in the physics engine."
date: "2024-05-24"
---

# Collision Detection

## Change Log

- **Version 1.2**: Updated optimization techniques.
- **Version 1.1**: Added BVH algorithms section.
- **Version 1.0**: Initial release.
```
