### Hierarchical Naming Conventions

Use a hierarchical naming convention to reflect the nested structure of your systems. This helps maintain clarity and organization.

**Example:**
```markdown
/Engine
    /Physics
        collision.mdboil
        rigidbody.md
    /Audio
        sound.md
        music.md
    /Lighting
        shadows.md
        globalillumination.md
```

### Frontmatter Metadata

Include frontmatter at the beginning of each Markdown file to store metadata. This metadata can be used for indexing and searching.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Collision Detection"
tags: ["physics", "collision"]
system: "Physics"
subsystem: "Collision"
version: "1.2"
summary: "Overview of the collision detection system in the physics engine."
date: "2024-05-24"
---
```

### Consistent Structure

Ensure that all Markdown files follow a consistent structure. This includes having a standard way to format headers, lists, code blocks, and other elements.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Collision Detection

## Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

## Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

## Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

### Explicit Section Delimiters

Use explicit delimiters for sections within a document. This can be done using Markdown headers or custom markers.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Collision Detection

<!-- Section: Introduction -->
## Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

<!-- Section: Algorithms -->
## Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

<!-- Section: Optimization -->
## Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

### Inline Annotations and Comments

Add inline annotations and comments to provide additional context or explanations.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Collision Detection

<!-- 
This section covers the basics of collision detection, including algorithms and optimization techniques.
The content is divided into the following subsections:
1. Introduction
2. Algorithms
3. Optimization
-->

## Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

## Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

## Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

### Standardized Terminology

Develop a glossary of standardized terms and use them consistently across all documents.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Glossary"
tags: ["reference", "terminology"]
---

# Glossary

## Collision Detection

The process of detecting when two or more physical objects in a game environment intersect or come into contact...

## Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

A data structure used to accelerate collision detection by organizing objects into a tree of bounding volumes...
```

### Data Formatting for LLM Ingestion

Prepare your Markdown content for ingestion by ensuring it is well-structured and clean. Use consistent formatting and tokenization.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Collision Detection"
tags: ["physics", "collision"]
system: "Physics"
subsystem: "Collision"
version: "1.2"
summary: "Overview of the collision detection system in the physics engine."
---

# Collision Detection

## Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

## Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

## Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

### Contextual Embeddings

Use embeddings to capture the meaning and relationships between different parts of the text.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Collision Detection"
tags: ["physics", "collision"]
system: "Physics"
subsystem: "Collision"
version: "1.2"
summary: "Overview of the collision detection system in the physics engine."
embeddings: ["collision detection", "BVH", "optimization"]
---

# Collision Detection

## Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

## Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

## Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

### Content Segmentation

Segment large documents into smaller, manageable chunks. This helps the LLM process and understand each part without being overwhelmed.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Collision Detection

## Part 1: Introduction

Collision detection is a crucial component of the physics engine...

## Part 2: Algorithms

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

BVH is a common technique for accelerating collision detection...

## Part 3: Optimization

Various optimization techniques can be applied to improve performance...
```

### Version Control and Updates

Keep track of versions and updates to your documents using version control systems like Git. Maintain a changelog for reference.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: "Collision Detection"
tags: ["physics", "collision"]
system: "Physics"
subsystem: "Collision"
version: "1.2"
summary: "Overview of the collision detection system in the physics engine."
date: "2024-05-24"
---

# Collision Detection

## Change Log

- **Version 1.2**: Updated optimization techniques.
- **Version 1.1**: Added BVH algorithms section.
- **Version 1.0**: Initial release.
```

### Bringing It All Together

By combining hierarchical naming conventions, frontmatter metadata, consistent structure, explicit section delimiters, inline annotations, standardized terminology, proper data formatting, contextual embeddings, content segmentation, and version control, you can create a robust and well-organized documentation system that is ready for LLM ingestion.

**Comprehensive Example:**

```markdown
---
title: "Collision Detection"
tags: ["physics", "collision"]
system: "Physics"
subsystem: "Collision"
version: "1.2"
summary: "Overview of the collision detection system in the physics engine."
date: "2024-05-24"
embeddings: ["collision detection", "BVH", "optimization"]
