# Correspondance with Nate Listrom 


> "I've had your blog bookmarked for months and enjoy exploring your concepts and ideas. It’s exciting to see that someone else is on a similar path and shares my interest in this topic."

Agreed! This particular altitude of story/narrative theory seems to be a bit niche, so it's always a pleasure to find someone with similar interests.

> "I noticed you've explored many of the same foundational authors in narrative theory, such as Propp, Sternberg, and Todorov."

I'm afraid you give me more credit than I deserve with regard to narrative theory. I've read Propp's Morphology of the Folktale, but I'm not yet familiar with Sternberg or Todorov. Alas, most of my exposure to ideas comes from more "pop" story theory like McKee, Field, and those who followed them.

> "When I first began my studies, it was difficult to discern the quality of some easily accessible bookshelf writers—those who seem to pull their experience and models out of thin air. It has been a pleasure to see how thorough you are in your work."

Thank you for your kind words. Yes, in screenwriting and novel writing fields, especially, there seems to have been a recent explosion in story "experts" publishing. But it's difficult to sift out the wheat from the chaff. As you point out, there are some genuinely really valuable insights, but few people offer much of a coherent, integrated system. (My own work falls into that camp somewhat. I haven't done the work to ground things in an overarching system, though I have some vague starting directions . . .)

> "But much as I appreciate McKee, he seems to offer a lot of 'ideas that make sense,' but it seems he lacks a general foundational model to place some of these great concepts in. Unfortunate because I see a lot of budding writers have difficulty applying a lot of his ideas.  Specifically, his 'gap in the scene' concept blew my mind. It reminds me of the excitement of going 'off book' in chess. Anyway, I digress."

I felt much the same about McKee's "gap"! I've found it to be an extremely useful idea, one of his that has stuck with me.

> "As for my work, I don't have a published website, but I do have a GitHub account where I back up my research: https://github.com/leechseed/_setsunadev. Its...a mess. But I hope it serves a bit of proof of my work."

After poking around briefly, it seems you've surveyed quite a lot of ground! If I'm understanding you correctly, you're working to collect and systematize much of the landscape of narratology. That seems like both an ambitious and potentially quite fruitful project.

> "'Knowing, feeling, and meaning' seem to serve as the components of the general idea of the 'function' of a story, focalized through the reader's perspective . . . A scene can provide 'knowing' (information or context necessary to progress the plot with coherence and continuity) . . . A scene can evoke 'feeling' (information or action involving a character or between characters meant to evoke an emotional response in the reader) . . . A scene can convey 'meaning' (through repetition, metaphor, or other narrative devices, a scene reinforces or reiterates a thematic line throughout the story) . . ."

Ah! I understand now. When I initially read your comment, I thought it was regarding design only. I did not realize that you meant it to apply to narrative. What you suggest totally makes sense.

It's not quite the same thing, but in the back of my mind, I've been toying with a four-part model of clarity, engagement, affect, and meaning.

The idea is that they build on one another.

First, a basic level of clarity must be reached. Spelling and grammar matter here, but so does structure, saying things in the right order such that your ideas come across.

Next, a story needs a way to engage its audience. (You can be perfectly clear, but if you're boring, you lose people. So engagement comes after clarity.) This leads to the discussion of narrative drive: expectation and anticipation, open loops, pacing and escalation, the brain's reward system.

But things end up hollow if they engage our attention alone. We need more than that to make us enjoy a story. We need feeling, emotion, affect. A story should move us somehow. (In addition to the traditional emotional payoffs for stories, I include a sense of discovery, wonder, or epiphany. I think they are legitimate affect even though they can be more "brain" than "heart.")

Lastly comes meaning in the broader, deeper sense. What is that ineffable something, which a good story leaves behind long after it has finished? The combination of theme and mood and symbol and feeling (and, as I saw mentioned in some of your work, the context that the reader/audience brings). Here, again, structure plays an important part, though in much subtler ways than in the clarity step.

Anyway, I quite like your 'knowing, feeling, meaning' model. I feel there are elements in common with clarity, engagement, affect, meaning. 'Knowing the context necessary to progress the plot' aligns somewhat with 'clarity.' 'Feeling' has an analog in 'affect.' And I think 'meaning' bridges across the two frameworks as well.

> "If it's not too much to ask, I'd love to sit down sometime and pick your brain, or if it's more convenient, continue the conversation through email."

I'd be thrilled to chat sometime. What timezone are you in? I'm on the US East Coast, so currently EDT/GMT-4. My schedule is a bit busy with work and three young kids at home (part of the reason I'm so slow in my writing), but I'm sure we can find something that works.

Thank you again for your kind words and for sharing your thoughts!

Best,

Nate
