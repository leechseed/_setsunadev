### **Theoretical Significance**

- **Impact on Narrative Style**:

  - The choices of tense, mood, and voice significantly shape the narrative style, influencing how readers engage with the story. For instance, a present-tense narrative can create a sense of urgency, while a past-tense narrative offers a reflective tone.

- **Influence on Reader Perception**:

  - Grammatical choices affect the reader's perception of time, causality, and character agency. Active voice tends to make characters appear more proactive, whereas passive voice can obscure responsibility or highlight actions.

- **Enhancing Thematic Expression**:

  - Mood can be used to underscore themes such as hope, despair, or determination. For example, the subjunctive mood may highlight characters' aspirations or fears, enriching the narrative's emotional depth.

- **Facilitating Narrative Cohesion**:

  - Consistent use of tense, mood, and voice contributes to narrative coherence, ensuring that the story flows logically and maintains a unified tone. It helps in establishing the narrative voice and maintaining consistency throughout the text.

- **Supporting Character Development**:
  - Grammatical choices can reflect and enhance character development. A character's dialogue in the indicative mood may reveal their straightforward nature, while their use of the subjunctive mood might indicate introspection or doubt.
