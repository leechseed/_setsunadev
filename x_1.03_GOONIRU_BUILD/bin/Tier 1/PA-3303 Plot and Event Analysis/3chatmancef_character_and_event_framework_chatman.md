### 1. **Title: Chatman's Character and Event Framework**

**Character and Event**:
**Definition**: In _"Story and Discourse"_ (1978), Seymour Chatman presents a framework for analyzing narratives by categorizing characters and events. He introduces the concepts of _kernel_ and _satellite_ characters, as well as _kernel_ and _satellite_ events, to differentiate between those that are central to the plot and those that provide additional context. This framework helps to understand how different components of a narrative contribute to the overall development and progression of the story.

### 3. Implications of Chatman's Character and Event Framework

**Impact on Narrative Theory**:
Chatman’s framework has been influential in narrative theory, particularly in distinguishing between major and minor elements of a story. By categorizing characters and events as kernels or satellites, Chatman provides a clear structure for analyzing how different components of a narrative contribute to its overall progression and thematic depth.

**Collaborative or Future-Oriented Insight**:
Chatman’s ideas are applicable across various narrative forms, including literature, film, theater, and interactive media. His framework helps to analyze how both core and supplementary elements of a story work together to create a cohesive narr

- **Theoretical Significance**:
  - **Impact on Narrative Theory**: Chatman’s Character and Event Framework has had a significant impact on narrative theory, particularly in the analysis of plot structure and character development. By distinguishing between kernel and satellite elements, Chatman’s framework provides a systematic way to analyze the complexity and hierarchy within narratives. This approach has been influential in both literary studies and media analysis, offering tools to dissect how stories are constructed and how different components interact to create meaning.
  - **Application Across Media**: While originally developed for literary analysis, Chatman’s framework is also applicable to other narrative forms, including film, television, and video games. In these mediums, the distinction between kernel and satellite elements can help to analyze the pacing, narrative focus, and character dynamics, offering insights into how different storytelling techniques are employed across various formats.
  - **Supporting Information**:
    - **Interdisciplinary Influence**: Chatman’s framework has influenced disciplines beyond literary studies, including film studies, where it is used to analyze screenplays and cinematic storytelling. In game studies, the distinction between kernel and satellite elements is useful for understanding branching narratives and player agency.
    - **Criticism and Adaptation**: Some critics have argued that the binary distinction between kernels and satellites may oversimplify the complexity of certain narratives, especially those that intentionally blur the lines between major and minor elements. However, subsequent scholars have expanded on Chatman’s ideas, adapting them to accommodate more fluid and complex narrative structures, particularly in postmodern and experimental works.
