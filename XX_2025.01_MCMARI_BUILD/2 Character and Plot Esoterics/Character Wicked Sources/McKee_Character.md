## 1. Introduction: The Centrality of Character

### 1.1 Most Important Concept

- McKee underscores that _character_ is the axis around which every story revolves. While plot structures events, it is character depth that creates resonance.

### 1.2 Key Breakdown

1. **Character vs. Plot**
   - Plot structures the sequence of events.
   - Character gives events meaning through human complexity.
2. **Emotional Investment**
   - Readers connect with characters who have vulnerabilities and conflicts.
   - Lasting impact arises from caring about _who_ things happen to, not just _what_ happens.
3. **The Inner Life of Characters**
   - Internal desires, contradictions, and secrets drive external actions.
   - Psychological truth is key to deep audience engagement.

## 2. The Role of Desire and Motivation

### 2.1 Most Important Concept

- Every character must be driven by a _core desire_, which dictates behavior and decision-making.

### 2.2 Key Breakdown

1. **Conscious vs. Unconscious Desires**
   - Conscious desire: The tangible goal a character pursues.
   - Unconscious desire: A deeper, often conflicting need that subtly influences actions.
2. **Desire in Conflict**
   - A character’s pursuit of a goal must be obstructed, creating true conflict.
3. **Narrative Function**
   - The protagonist’s desire drives the story forward.
   - Secondary characters exist to challenge or support that pursuit.

## 3. The Creation of Character Dimensions

### 3.1 Most Important Concept

- Fully rounded characters have multiple _dimensions_, including contradictions, hidden traits, and shifting emotional states.

2. **Contradictions Create Depth**
   - Internal conflicts (e.g., courage vs. insecurity) create intrigue.

---

2. **Revealing True Character**
   - Moral dilemmas and conflicts draw out authentic behavior.
3. **Pitfalls of Shallow Characterization**
   - Relying on quirks or stereotypes weakens depth.
