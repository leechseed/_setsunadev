### Title: **Propp's 31 Narrative Functions Framework**

- **Vladimir Propp's 31 Narrative Functions**:
  - **Definition**: Vladimir Propp identified 31 narrative functions in his seminal work *"Morphology of the Folktale"*. These functions represent the fundamental building blocks of folktale narratives and typically occur in a fixed sequence.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Fixed Sequence of Events**:
      - **Definition**: The 31 functions follow a specific order in folktales, starting with an initial situation and moving through various stages of conflict, action, and resolution. Each function contributes to the narrative’s progression and the development of the hero’s journey.
      - **Contextualization**: Propp’s framework has been influential in the study of narrative structure, providing a systematic approach to analyzing folktales and identifying common patterns across different cultures and stories. By categorizing these functions, Propp laid the groundwork for understanding the universal elements of storytelling.


1. **Absentation**:
   - A family member leaves the home or is otherwise absent (e.g., a parent dies or goes away, the hero departs).

2. **Interdiction**:
   - A prohibition or command is given to the hero (e.g., "Do not go into the forest").

3. **Violation of Interdiction**:
   - The interdiction is violated (e.g., the hero disobeys and goes into the forest).

4. **Reconnaissance**:
   - The villain attempts to gather information about the hero (e.g., spies on the hero, tries to find out about weaknesses).

5. **Delivery**:
   - The villain receives information about the hero (e.g., finds out where the hero lives or about a secret).

6. **Trickery**:
   - The villain attempts to deceive the hero (e.g., disguises themselves, pretends to be someone else).

7. **Complicity**:
   - The hero is deceived by the villain and unwittingly helps them (e.g., the hero believes the villain’s lies or gives away crucial information).

8. **Villainy**:
   - The villain causes harm or injury to a family member (e.g., kidnapping, theft, casting a spell).

9. **Mediation**:
   - The hero becomes aware of the villainy or a lack and is dispatched or receives a call to action (e.g., the hero is told of the loss and sets out to find a solution).

10. **Counteraction**:
    - The hero decides to act in response to the villainy or lack (e.g., prepares to embark on a quest).

11. **Departure**:
    - The hero leaves home to begin the quest (e.g., setting out on the journey).

12. **First Function of the Donor**:
    - The hero encounters a donor who tests, interrogates, or attacks the hero (e.g., the hero meets a magical helper who challenges them).

13. **Hero's Reaction**:
    - The hero responds to the actions of the donor, often passing a test or showing kindness (e.g., the hero passes the test, helps the donor, or solves a riddle).

14. **Acquisition**:
    - The hero receives a magical agent or object as a reward (e.g., a sword, potion, or ring).

15. **Guidance**:
    - The hero is led to the whereabouts of the object of the search (e.g., the hero is shown the way to the villain's lair).

16. **Struggle**:
    - The hero and the villain engage in direct combat or a battle (e.g., a fight, a contest).

    - The hero is marked in some way (e.g., receives a scar, brand, or some distinguishing feature).

18. **Victory**:

19. **Liquidation**:
    - The initial misfortune or lack is resolved (e.g., the hero rescues the victim, retrieves the stolen item, breaks the spell).

20. **Return**:
    - The hero starts the journey back home (e.g., begins the return trip).

    - The hero is rescued from pursuit or a trap (e.g., is saved by a magical helper or a sudden intervention).

23. **Unrecognized Arrival**:
    - The hero returns home or to another place but is not recognized (e.g., returns in disguise, or the hero's identity is unknown).

24. **Unfounded Claims**:
    - A false hero presents unfounded claims to the success or achievements of the hero (e.g., someone else claims to have done what the hero did).
