"I spent an hour farming penguins for crow feet so I could spend three hours grinding trolls. Then, I could sit in this room at the top of a castle, only to go back to grinding penguins for crow feet. After that, I returned to the top of the castle to kill a banished knight for two hours to get the full alternate banished knight set. When I finally put it all on, I thought it was ugly and realized I was fat rolling. Never mind, so I went back to the trolls for another hour to loot that one sword from the anime shown in the trailer without getting one-shotted by the big wolf thing. When I equipped the anime sword, I didn't really like how slow it was, so then I switched back to the claymore. Then, this one chick with pink hair asked if I wanted to go on a date and I was like, 'Hell yeah.' So we went to her house, but it was weird because she wasn't there. Instead, I ended up lying in her mom's lap, which was weird but felt good. Overall, I wasted a whole two days without sleep only to figure out nothing because I was watching other people play Elden Ring on my second monitor the entire time. The best part was being able to say, 'Oh, now I get Elden Ring,' and being able to genuinely laugh at rage compilations. Finally, I felt what it's like to try hard at something and think, 'Wow, this must be an exact replication of what it means to work hard and feel accomplished.' And hey, wow, yeah, that's awesome. The best part is validating myself watching these other people struggle at the same exact points that I did, smile, and feel like I'm part of something special while simultaneously managing my real-life status bars of self-delusion. Luckily, I picked up every red bush berry thing and all these bird feet to turn down the volume of the Forever Unsilenced Imposter, but his moveset is insanely complex. I have a strange respect for him in a way. No matter what I do, it seems that I can't dodge, block, or parry his Ash of War, 'Gaslighting Shout.' It’s the windup that always screws me up. I always forget the timing, especially after his potion punish, but by the way, I always nail that opening right after he tries to bait me into checking my teeth because there's definitely something stuck between my front two teeth. I bet if I went and looked, they would be there, but I'm always snapped back to reality when I have to keep dodge rolling in the menu because there isn't any pause. But anyway, does anyone have any tips on how to time the Gaslighting Shout Ash of War? Should I dodge before he shifts the weight of his body to his front foot, or is it like an audio cue? 'What a goddamn RETARD' (dodge here??). Anyways, Asmongold is right about everything, and if he can make it being true to himself, then I know it, you know it, everybody knows it. But the horse guy at the beginning—I can't get past him in my real playthrough, but I am determined to do this run in the order intended by the Hiyao Miyazaki of League of Legends fame and master storyteller JRR Tolkien, most notably known for the Emmy Nominated HBO Miniseries The Wire. 7/10, wait for the Steam summer sale."

fixd? 

Spent an hour farming penguins for crow feet so I can spend three hours grinding trolls so I can run up to this room at the top of a castle so i can go back to grinding penguins for crow feet so i farm this banished knight in the most efficient way possible for the next two hours so i can get the full alternate banished knight set but simply put I put the whole set  on and thought i looked like a fuckin twat 'CODPIECE A BIT BIG ON YA DOH INNIT? SHIT! THAS OLRITE'  Plus I wannent as lithe lookin like a fat nanny rollin round like onna dem dung baetls. nvm so I went back to the trolls for another hour so i can go to Caitlyn and loot that one sword from that one anime (Sword Art?) out in that box in the back of that trailer from Oregon Trial without getting one chomped by that two headed Warwick thing but then when i equipped the anime sword i didn't really like how slow it was and how unrealistic it would be if someone actually tried to walk into battle during the Elden Ring period of the Middle Ages. Lost my immersion a bit but I felt better after pumpin up my sex so i can dual wield samurai swords. I know dei WOKEBACK strokehog mcgee has a bad track record but I'll cut them some slack for including an eastern officer's weapon from the great war in a historically ethno-centric western time period.  so then i went back to the claymore and this one chick with the pink hair asked if i wanted to hold hands lmao genz weirdflex writing but its 2024. I know its a nitpick but still but then the load screen took us to her house without consent. There must have been a glitch because I sat by the fireplace and couldn't save. Found a way around it by just teleworking to the very first bonfire and then going back to her house. Then the fireplace worked fine and I could say. Can someone explain this to me? Is this some lore accurate Fromsoft redditor type nod or just another glitch that should have been polished by launch?  but it was weird man her house was huge. I looked in all the rooms and couldn't find her but I chalked it up to the whole level loading the assets in wrong. I've done a bit of game design in RPGMaker GX V. Right now I'm in RC9 of this vertical slice demo video for our prototype combat system that I built myself in ChatGpt4. Its pretty sweet. Also dude AI is the future, Im basically fluent in Brazilian Jiu Kaisen (aka json *heh snoo in cheek for my fellow 1337s!)* and plan to incorporate it in my rust based fullstack knowledgeable front end which I coded it to look like an exact clone of Instagram lmao. I bet I could Gronk heck out of the in-person interview at any Western studio. I'd say no anyway cause I'd rather die by virtues than to sell my talent to a bunch of business school asset flippers amirite? So i did the quest where I put my head in her moms lap which was weird but idk. I think its cause I've never thought about resting my head on a woman's lap before. Despite my huge brain I surprised myself with what little I have left to learn about the females and touching them with my hands and other areas of my exposed body skin.   Overall wasted a whole two days without sleep trying to figure out this game without help but to be honest I wasn't giving my full attention due to my sudden and unforeseen life threatening medical emergency. As you can probably tell by my narrative voice I have been pretty sick so I apologize for that. With all the allegations flying around its honestly taken a hit on my mental health. I basically am a workaholic when I find time and you know, not many people talk about mental health and playing a cognitively challenging game along with the roleplay I chose, truly is a test of a man's ability to self discipline but also to seek balance when facing tremendously insurmountable yet plausible goals.  For those who think I'm joking, to walk the path of the warrior means pushing yourself to the limit. After calling 911 twice and taking it back both times I was admitted to the ER for a scrotal abscess and a subsequent infection that sent me into diabetic ketoacidosis. I had to have surgery to drain the fluid from the abscess and holy shit that had to be the worst smell I've ever had in my life. It was so dense that it felt like I tasted it. And the nurse just kept handing the doctor these gauzes to whipe it all up and bro he was just squeezing and man I was awake the whole time. I felt bad for them but then I realized that dude that's probably the boilerplate scent of the times during Elden Ring. Could you imagine? It makes a lot of sense when you think of those 3 humors bile draining big beak mask doctors man. They were the ones who sacrificed to saved lives. Those masks were used to capture the smell of infection so they can determine the correct physik to prescribe. That's one thing I love about this game. There's so much historical accuracy despite the disadvantage that japanese developers have when reading english. So taking a break from the internet for a few weeks might be in order. But don't worry I will not forget the goal I set for myself earlier to accomplish in Elden Ring. The creator from Minecraft, Steve, said 'As long as you're playing a game its time not wasted.' I will never forget that quote because people will always come for gamers first especially when it comes to beating an skill based action mmo like Elden Ring. That time I spent on that last character wasn't for nothing. Because I was gaming. Not only that, I watched other people play elden ring. I even would skip to the parts where I thought I was and try and copy what they did. I basically played this game twice at he same time. Also, second monitor, will change your life forever. That and this program called Notion and Personal Knowledge Management. You aren't functioning at capacity if you aren't building a second brain. I'm on my third. Its why I need two monitors. Its why I can wear two Elden Rings salami. The best part about buying elden ring and then playing the game was trying to find the perfect moment to say 'oh...now i get it' Personally I had to redo it a couple times. But in all honesty, the best time was when I said it without even noticing I said anything. Looking back at it, the first time I pressed 'Play' and closed the game because it took too long to find my controller and I wanted to see if there was an opening cutscene and saw that Usage Time 2.1 hours, I knew there was no going back. Thats when I knew Elden Ring changed my life and I had transcended into an exclusive club of people who actually bought elden ring and have it.  The best part about being the Elden Ring is genuinely understanding the rage of others like myself. I remember that boss. I remember when I watched this other guy fight that boss and he struggled as well. But I know, even amongst fellow termanids, that when Marguerite invades my Erd realm, he won't even know what to do. In fact, I am so based at this game, I'll even solo him.  If you haven't purchased this game and installed it, maybe what I say next will convince you. Now I now what it is to truly feel like to accomplish something so impossibly unreal. My life is immeasurably better and my penis grow to above maximum.  I sincerely told the guy who works at the Circle K every time I buy a pack of cigarettes that what I've done and accomplished is the equivalent of beating the Navy Seals. The best part is validating myself watching these other people struggle at the same exact points that I did and smile and feel like I'm part of something special while simultaneously microing my irl status bars of self-delusion, luckily i picked up every red bush berry thing and all these bird feet to take and craft in the this particular sideways sink hole.  The range of the Forever Unsilenced Ahh Real Imposter (in my head) Ash of War second phase mechanics are insanely complex. I feel like the parameters of its range is determined either or both the altitude and proximity to the closest Etc Tree. I have a strange respect for my personal demon OC in a way. No matter what I do it seems that I can't dodge, block, or parry his Ash of War, 'Gaslightning Shout'. Its the windup that always screws me up, I always forget the timing because I usually base my dodge timing on if I can proc the crit on the english or spanish freezing spell. Usually the curse lasts longer than his stamina anyways and 99% of the time it runs out and he pippa strokes himself in in an egregiously.   especially after his potion punish but btw I always nail that opening right after he tries to bait me into checking my teeth cause  there's definitely something stuck between my front two teeth and I bet if i went and looked a whole slice of bolognese  would be there but I'm always snapped back to reality when I have to keep dodge rolling in the menu cause there isn't any pause. But anyways should I dodge before he moves the weight of his body to his front foot? or is it like an audio cue? "Whatta FUCKIN RE (dodge here??) TARD" Anyways Asmongold is right about everything and if he can make it being true to himself then I know it, you know it, everybody knows it, but honestly the truth is the horse guy at the beginning  I can't get past him and I just can't do it man. I just wana lay in bed and listen to the same song over and over again but forreal when i start my real play through I am determined to do this run in the order intended  and 100% romance every female girl in the game. 

When a game has the blessing of acclaimed names like Himiyohyao Miyazaki, legendary Founder of League of Legends  and  master storyteller JRR Tolkein most notably known for the Emmy Nominated HBO Miniseries the Wire. 7/10 I'd stick it out for just another day for steam summer sale to start.
