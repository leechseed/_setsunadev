# How to Use This Reference

1. **Planning Stage**: Use the chapters as a checklist. Before drafting your novel or RPG campaign, scan each category (economy, geography, religion, etc.) to ensure you’ve addressed the basics.

2. **Revision Stage**: After you have a rough draft, revisit these topics to strengthen weak areas. Ask targeted questions—e.g., “Have I properly integrated the consequences of widespread magic into daily life?”

3. **Deep Dive Inspiration**: If you find an underdeveloped concept in your world (e.g., the justice system or magical technology), focus on that corresponding section for brainstorming prompts.

4. **Sensitive & Inclusive Creation**: Pay extra attention to the essays on cultural borrowing, representation, and minimalism. These guideposts help you avoid unintentional harm and create more layered, respectful worlds.

5. **Ongoing World Maintenance**: Worlds are alive in the minds of creators and audiences. As your story or game evolves, let these essays remind you of potential expansions—new tensions, unforeseen consequences, or cultural shifts.
