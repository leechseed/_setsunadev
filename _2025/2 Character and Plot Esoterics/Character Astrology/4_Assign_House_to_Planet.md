## 3. Placing the Planets in Houses: Step-by-Step Strategy

1. **Identify Your Character’s Core Theme**:

   - Is your protagonist a restless innovator, a devoted romantic, or a relentless detective? That core archetype can guide planetary house assignments. For example, an investigator archetype might need Pluto or Mars in the 8th House.

2. **Prioritize Your “Focal Planets”**:

   - Decide which planets drive the story.
   - A romance-driven story might emphasize **Venus** (for love/relationships) in a prominent house (5th, 7th).
   - A power struggle or major transformation might emphasize **Pluto** in the 8th or 10th House.

3. **Determine Motivations and Conflicts**:

   - Use the planet-house combination to establish internal and external drivers. For instance:
     - **Moon in the 12th House** \(\rightarrow\) Subconscious fears or emotional isolation.
     - **Saturn in the 10th House** \(\rightarrow\) Heavy career responsibilities leading to internal tension about public success.

4. **Weave in Contrasts and Tension**:

   - Place multiple planets so they create competing desires. For example:
     - **Sun in the 10th House** vs. **Moon in the 4th House** might show a conflict between career ambition and home responsibilities.

5. **Add Supporting Cast Dynamics**:
   - If you want rivalry or cooperation, look at how different characters’ planetary house placements create tension or harmony. For instance, one character’s **Mars in 8th** could clash with another’s **Venus in 5th** if one is drawn to mysteries while the other just wants to enjoy life’s pleasures.
