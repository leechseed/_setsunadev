## 🎯 Executive Summary

This plan outlines the strategy to complete a full **Factorio: Railworld** playthrough on normal difficulty using **only belts for all logistics**. Logistic and construction bots are strictly disallowed. However, **blueprint importing is in full scope** and serves as a critical efficiency and quality control measure. The goal is to build, optimize, and scale a belt-centric megabase culminating in a rocket launch, leveraging robust blueprint libraries for bus layouts, train intersections, smelters, science modules, and kill zones.

## 📌 Project Scope Statement

### **In Scope**
- Use of **blueprinted layouts**, whether created manually or imported from trusted libraries.
- Full automation using **belts only** for material movement, including trains for long-haul ore transport.
- All science types, military defense, satellite construction, and rocket launch.
- Modular and replicable infrastructure.
- Central bus design with decentralized outposts and local smelting.

### **Out of Scope**
- Logistic bots (passive providers, requester chests, etc.)
- Personal roboport construction bots
- Multiplayer collaboration

## 📋 Quality Management Plan

* **Blueprint Validation**: All imported blueprints must be tested and tile correctly in current terrain.
* **Logistics Policy**: All items must move via belts or trains—*no logistic bots at any point*.
* **Science Uptime**: All science types must sustain 60 SPM minimum before scaling.
* **Endgame Metric**: Rocket must launch with fully automated satellite, all belt-fed.
