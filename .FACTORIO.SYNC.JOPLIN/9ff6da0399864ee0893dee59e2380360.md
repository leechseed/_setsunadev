## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

**Beltline Salvation** is a belt-only, blueprint-integrated Factorio Railworld run designed to simulate a PMP-certified engineering project in a hostile environment. It functions as both a creative challenge and a structural test for scalable planning systems.

### Business Justification
- To master long-form project management through gameplay  
- To develop and test a universal PMP/AI bootstrap template  
- To have endless fun through iterative engineering puzzles  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Scope Statement

### In-Scope
- Belt-only logistics for all production and delivery  
- Full use of imported and custom blueprints  
- Rail logistics for outposts and resource transport  
- Centralized and decentralized factory design patterns  
- Modular, versioned documentation for each WBS phase  
- External, documented AI or assistant help for planning support  

### Out-of-Scope
- Logistic bots and construction bots (including personal roboports)  
- Multiplayer assistance or collaboration  
- Untracked undocumented interventions  
- Modded item duplication or power cheats  
- Spaghetti base expansions without planning schema

## ðŸ”’ Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

| Constraint              | Value/Placeholder                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Map Seed               | [TO BE FILLED AFTER GAME START]          |
| Difficulty             | Normal                                   |
| Terrain Setting        | Railworld (long distances between patches)|
| Blueprint Policy       | Full importing allowed, must be versioned|
| Enemy Aggression       | Default                                  |
| Mods                   | [TO BE CONFIRMED]                        |

### Assumptions
- The project will be executed in solo play  
- Mods, if used, will not alter balance or break belt-only logic  
- Game interface and save state remain stable throughout run  
- Blueprint versions will be manually tracked and validated  

---

## ðŸ“Š Objectives

### High-Level Objectives
- Successfully launch a rocket on a belt-only Railworld map  
- Complete and document all WBS phases with binder entries  
- Scale base to at least 60 SPM (Science Packs per Minute)  
- Operate without logistic bots, using belts and trains only  
- Validate blueprint integrity through live performance  
- Sustain long-term pollution resistance and defense  

### Deliverable Targets
- Full knowledgebase binder with one document per phase  
- Blueprint register file (versioned, annotated)  
- Final save file and factory screenshot  
- Screenshots captured for timelapse documentation  
- Timelapse video uploaded to YouTube
