## 🎯 Phase Objective

Establish a stable and expandable starting base with reliable power, early smelting, and basic automation for red and green science. This foundation supports the bus and train systems that follow in later phases.

## 📥 Inputs Required

| Item                        | Source / Dependency        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Basic Burner Tech Unlocked  | Game start                 |
| Access to Coal/Iron/Copper  | Near spawn                 |
| Power Generation Blueprints | Internal/Imported          |
| Smelting Blueprints         | `Furnace Array v1.0`       |

## 📤 Expected Outputs

- [ ] Automated furnace array (Iron + Copper)  
- [ ] Stable steam power (2–4 engines)  
- [ ] Belt-fed coal loop  
- [ ] Automated gear, plate, and circuit production  
- [ ] Red and green science at minimum 30 SPM  
- [ ] Initial blueprint grid (chunk-aligned, modular)  

---

## 📊 Blueprint References

- `Furnace Array v1.0`  
- `Main Bus Starter v1.1`  
- `Early Steam Engine Block v1.0`  
- `Basic Science Assembler v1.2`

## 🧩 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                           | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                          |
|--------------------------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| Coal line jam / power failure  | High       | High   | Use belt prioritization + dual coal sources  |
| Early pollution triggering biters | Medium  | Medium | Limit unnecessary early expansion            |
| Build drift from blueprint grid | Medium     | High   | Enforce chunk-based layout from day one      |
| Manual resupply fatigue        | High       | Low    | Automate inserters and belts ASAP            |

---

## 📈 Milestone Targets

| Metric                  | Target Value        |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Red Science             | 30 SPM              |
| Green Science           | 30 SPM              |
| Iron Plate Throughput   | 3,000/min           |
| Copper Plate Throughput | 2,000/min           |
| Power Output            | 5 MW                |

## 📝 Logs (Optional)

_Notes for future reference or next iteration:_

- Consider leaving extra room near coal field to loop back burner miners  
- Vertical space between furnaces and power may allow a belt priority bypass  
- Watch for tree lines that can create pollution buffer or hide biter nests
