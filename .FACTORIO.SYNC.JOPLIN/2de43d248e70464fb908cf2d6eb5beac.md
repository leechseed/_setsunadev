## 🎯 Purpose

The **Phase Playbook** is a tactical document that guides execution of a single WBS phase. It includes everything required to:

- Start the phase with clarity  
- Know what success looks like  
- Track deliverables and risks  
- Prepare transition into the next phase  
- Standardize repeatable build logic across multiple runs  

This keeps complex builds like *Beltline Salvation* scalable, adaptable, and auditable.

## 📐 Documentation Standards

### Format

- **Markdown `.md` file** with YAML frontmatter (see template below)
- Anchored **Table of Contents** enabled
- All blueprint names should include version numbers (e.g., `Steel Smelter v1.3`)
- All headers must follow 1–2–3 nesting logic

### Naming Convention

- File: `phase-[number]-[short-name]-playbook.md`
  - Example: `phase-3-rail-logistics-playbook.md`
