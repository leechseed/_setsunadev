Logistic and construction bots are strictly disallowed. However, **blueprint importing is in full scope** and serves as a critical efficiency and quality control measure. The goal is to build, optimize, and scale a belt-centric megabase culminating in a rocket launch, leveraging robust blueprint libraries for bus layouts, train intersections, smelters, science modules, and kill zones.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 📌 Project Scope Statement\\\n\\\n### **In Scope**\\\n- Use of **blueprinted layouts**, whether created manually or imported from trusted libraries.\\\n- Full automation using **belts only** for material movement, including trains for long-haul ore transport.\\\n- All science types, military defense, satellite construction, and rocket launch.\\\n- Modular and replicable infrastructure.\\\n- Central bus design with decentralized outposts and local smelting.\\\n\\\n### **Out of Scope**\\\n- Logistic bots (passive providers, requester chests, etc.)\\\n- Personal roboport construction bots\\\n- Multiplayer collaboration\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\n## 🧱 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)\\\n\\\n```mermaid\\\nmindmap\\\n  root((**Beltline Salvation WBS**))\\\n    **1.
