# üìò Integration Report: Applying NCP to ASTRO7EX

**Section**: Narrative Context Protocol (NCP) Deployment Strategy
**Project**: ASTRO7EX
**Studio**: GUTS99
**Date**: 2025-07-26
**Prepared by**: Narrative Chemistry Engine

---

## üéØ Objective

To document the initial implementation of the Narrative Context Protocol (NCP) into the ASTRO7EX development workflow, with a focus on structural narrative tracking, GPT integration, authorial metadata preservation, and multi-agent storytelling. This version includes infrastructure extensions for API access, personal style databases, and schema customization.

---

## üß≠ Methodological Overview

### **Primary Goal**

To encode the ASTRO7EX narrative structure, voice, and evolution into a machine-readable, version-controlled format (NCP) usable across GPT workflows, local tooling, and future narrative systems.

---

## üìê Framework Used

### **Dramatica ‚Üí NCP Translation**

All core elements from ASTRO7EX‚Äôs Dramatica reports (including throughlines, domains, concerns, issues, arcs, and journeys) are converted into a standardized NCP schema that allows:

* Persistent storage of story structure
* Cross-agent interpretation of theme and character intent
* Transparent revision tracking

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases Supported

### **1. Centralized Dramatica Integration**

* Aggregates outputs from Dramatica Reports, markdown note repos, and ChatGPT transcripts into a structured `ncp-schema.json`.
* Ensures every narrative choice is traceable, reusable, and attached to its source and rationale.

---

### **3. GPT-Enhanced Authoring**

* GPT uses `ncp-schema.json` as a **narrative constraints map**, ensuring each scene it generates:

  * Aligns with Dramatica structure
  * Obeys voice rules, thematic arcs, and story logic
  * Avoids tone drift or structural violations

---

### **4. Story Evolution Logging**

* Canonical revision log inside the schema captures key creative decisions over time.
* Each log entry is timestamped and attributed, supporting rollback, audits, and alternate forks.

---

### **5. Multi-Agent Storytelling (Option A)**

* GPT simulates **scene-level conflicts** with independent agent voices (e.g., MODS, Vivian, Nacho), all informed by `ncp-schema.json`.
* Scenes become generative, character-driven simulations, grounded in your thematic skeleton.

## üìä Throughline Mapping Summary

| Throughline             | Domain         | Theme                        | Agent Role              |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Overall Story           | Activity       | Conditioning vs. Instinct    | Narrative Frame         |
| Main Character (Vivian) | Mind           | Corrupted Memory vs. Meaning | Protagonist (Steadfast) |
| Impact Character (MODS) | Fixed Attitude | Stasis vs. Transformation    | Anti-dialogic Firewall  |
| Relationship            | Manipulation   | Power through Silence        | Emotional Friction      |

---

## ‚úÖ Current Outcomes

* All Dramatica logic is now **machine-readable and extensible** via JSON.
* Authorial decisions are **versioned**, tagged, and portable across agents, sessions, and platforms.
* GPT is now context-locked into **thematic and structural integrity** when writing scenes.
* **Scene simulations** using multi-agent prompts are live and testable.

---

## ‚ûï Version 2 Additions: Infrastructure Extensions

---

### **A. API-Enabled NCP Access**

#### ‚úÖ Purpose

Enable other programs, tools, or custom GPTs to interact with NCP data via a REST API.

#### ‚úÖ Implementation

* Build a lightweight Flask/FastAPI wrapper around `ncp-schema.json`
* Example endpoints:

  * `GET /scene/17` ‚Üí pulls relevant structure and theme
  * `GET /theme/memory` ‚Üí returns scenes addressing MC Concern
  * `POST /revision` ‚Üí logs a change to the structure
* Supports real-time storygen workflows, dashboards, or custom frontends

---

### **B. Authorial Style + Inspiration Database**

#### ‚úÖ Purpose

Turn your personal references, tropes, aesthetics, and influences into a **queryable database** you can apply to future stories.

#### ‚úÖ Implementation

* Define a new sub-schema:

```json
"inspirations": [
  {
    "source": "Gurren Lagann",
    "aspect": "Escalating metaphysics in climax",
    "applied_to": "Act IV Signpost 4: Changing One‚Äôs Nature"
  }
]
```

* Store alongside or link to your `ncp-schema.json`
* Use it to auto-tag new stories or enforce tone/style alignment
* Eventually evolve into your **narrative fingerprint repository**

---

### **C. Custom Schema Extensions & Forking**

#### ‚úÖ Purpose

Extend NCP to serve your exact creative systems without needing to wait for upstream changes.

#### ‚úÖ Implementation

* Add custom fields prefixed with `x-`, e.g.:

```json
"x-guts99-style": {
  "tone_palette": ["melancholic", "ironic", "manic-cosmic"],
  "dialogue_register": "emotionally layered but clipped",
  "core_vices": ["meaning-lust", "hope in dead systems"]
}
```

* No need to fork unless:

  * You want to **distribute your version**
  * You want official tooling to support your fields natively
* You can still publish as: `NCP:GUTS99` or `NCP-ASTRO7EX`
