## 📖 Definition

**Build Drift** refers to the gradual misalignment of placed entities (e.g., assemblers, belts, inserters) from a standardized grid or blueprint layout—especially when designs are implemented manually or improvised over time.

In *Factorio*, this often manifests as:
- Slight shifts in rows/columns that desync with later blueprints  
- Misaligned belts that can’t be snapped into modules  
- Incremental spacing errors that snowball into structural failures

## 📉 Risk Impact

| Factor            | Value       |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Likelihood        | Medium      |
| Impact            | High        |
| Affected Phases   | All (especially Phases 1–3) |
| Resulting Issues  | Incompatible blueprints, belt jams, UPS inefficiencies, rework cost |

Once drift sets in, it becomes exponentially harder to:
- Apply blueprints at scale  
- Use bots or cut/copy/paste logic  
- Maintain symmetry or visual clarity  
- Avoid hard refactors in later megabase phases

## 🧱 Causes of Drift

| Cause                           | Description                                               |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Manual placement without guides| Players “eyeball” tile placement, which breaks symmetry  |
| Blueprint grid not initialized | No defined chunk-aligned origin from start               |
| Early improvisation            | Ad-hoc builds from Phase 0 that never get re-aligned     |
| Forgetting absolute snap rules | Blueprint previews allow soft placement without shift     |
| Disregarding terrain gaps      | Adjusting builds around trees, cliffs, or water tiles     |

## 🔧 Mitigation Strategy: Chunk-Based Layout

### 🧭 What is a Chunk-Based Grid?

Factorio’s map is built in **32×32 tile chunks**. Aligning blueprints to chunk borders ensures:
- Optimal rendering performance (UPS stability)  
- Predictable copy/paste behavior  
- Seamless module tiling across factory sections  

### 🛠 Implementation Steps

1. **Start with a Blueprint-Aligned Reference Tile**
   - Use a “Chunk Marker” blueprint or any blueprint that’s chunk-aligned
2. **Build Initial Structures on Chunk Lines**
   - Place your bus spine, furnace array, and science blocks using blueprint previews snapped to 32×32 spacing
3. **Lock Core Modules to a Grid**
   - Every repeated structure (smelters, circuits, science, stations) must lock to the same grid anchor
4. **Don’t Break Grid for Terrain**
   - Use landfill or skip tiles before bending blueprints off-grid

---

## 📐 Best Practices

- 🔲 Use grid-aligned ghost blueprints as planning overlays  
- 🧱 Use modular blueprints sized in multiples of 32 (e.g., 64×64, 32×96)  
- 🧭 Use mod tools like *Chunky Walls* or *Grid Overlay* (optional)  
- ✂️ If you must improvise, do it outside the core grid zone  
- 💬 Label grid intersections using signs or blueprint ghosts

## ✅ Recommendations

| Action                            | Priority | Notes                              |
|-----------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Establish chunk-aligned base grid | 🔥 High  | Required before major bus or rail  |
| Apply all early blueprints to grid| 🔥 High  | Prevents cascading misalignments   |
| Use only grid-validated blueprints| 🟡 Medium| Reduce custom edits unless tracked |
| Document origin tile in binder    | 🟢 Low   | For auditing/debugging if needed   |

By addressing build drift at the **foundational level**, future phases become exponentially easier to blueprint, scale, and replicate. Do it wrong now, and you’ll pay interest in refactor debt later.
