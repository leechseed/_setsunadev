# Directory of Narrative Elements

## 1. **Structure**
   - **Narrative Structure**
     - **Fabula and Syuzhet**:
       - **Fabula**: The chronological series of events in the story (the "what" happens).
       - **Syuzhet**: The way those events are organized and presented to the reader (the "how" it’s told). This distinction is crucial in narratology, where the manipulation of time and order is a key aspect of narrative analysis.
   - **Narrative Functions**
     - **Functions**: Borrowing from Vladimir Propp’s work on Russian folktales, functions are the basic building blocks of narrative action. Propp identified 31 functions that serve as narrative units in a story.
       - **Preparatory functions**: Introducing the hero, the villain, and setting up the conflict.
       - **Principal functions**: Actions that drive the narrative forward (e.g., the hero’s journey, confrontation with the villain).
       - **Resultative functions**: Actions leading to the resolution or conclusion of the story.

## 2. **Perspectives**
   - **Narrative Levels**
     - **Story (Histoire)**: The events, characters, and settings of the narrative—the content or raw material.
     - **Discourse (Discours)**: The expression or narration of the story—how the narrative is presented to the audience, including the point of view, style, and narrative voice.
   - **Narrative Voice and Focalization**
     - **Narrative Voice**: Who is telling the story.
       - **Heterodiegetic Narrator**: A narrator who is not a character within the story.
       - **Homodiegetic Narrator**: A narrator who is also a character in the story.
     - **Focalization**: The perspective through which the narrative events are presented.
       - **Internal Focalization**: The narrative is focused through the perspective of a character within the story.
       - **External Focalization**: The narrative is presented from an outside perspective, not tied to any character’s subjective view.
       - **Zero Focalization**: The narrator has an omniscient perspective, knowing all thoughts, feelings, and actions.
   - **Narrative Modality**
     - **Narrative Mode**: The attitude or stance that the narrator takes towards the events being described.
       - **Mimesis**: The direct presentation of events, often through dialogue or detailed description, creating an illusion of reality.
       - **Diegesis**: The narrator recounts events, summarizing or describing rather than showing them directly.
   - **Narrative Dynamics**
     - **Narrative Tension**: The suspense or emotional intensity created by the narrative.
     - **Narrative Closure**: The degree to which a narrative resolves its conflicts and questions, providing a sense of completion.

## 3. **Semantics**
   - **Genre and Narrative Codes**
     - **Genre**: The categorization of narrative based on its thematic, structural, and stylistic characteristics.
       - **Narrative Codes**: The conventions and norms that govern specific genres. Roland Barthes identified narrative codes such as the **hermeneutic code** (creating mystery and suspense) and the **proairetic code** (actions that imply further action or consequences).
   - **Intertextuality**
     - **Intertextuality**: The relationship between this narrative and other texts. Narratives often reference, echo, or transform other narratives, creating layers of meaning.
       - **Allusion**: Direct or indirect references to other texts.
       - **Parody**: Imitation with a critical or humorous twist.
       - **Pastiche**: A work that imitates the style or character of the works of one or more other artists, often celebrating rather than mocking the original.
   - **Theme**
     - **Definition**: The underlying message, central idea, or insight into life that the story conveys.
     - **Examples**: Love, revenge, power, fate, freedom, etc.

## 4. **Character**
   - **Characterization**
     - **Actants**: In narratology, characters are often analyzed as "actants," performing specific roles within the narrative structure, as seen in the work of A.J. Greimas.
       - **Subject**: The protagonist or main actor.
       - **Object**: The goal or desire that drives the narrative.
       - **Sender**: The force that sends the subject on their quest.
       - **Receiver**: Who or what the subject’s actions are directed towards.
       - **Helper**: Allies that assist the subject.
       - **Opponent**: Forces or characters that oppose the subject.

## 5. **Space**
   - **Narrative Space**
     - **Spatialization**: The use of space within the narrative, not just as a setting but as a dynamic element that influences the plot and character actions. Gérard Genette's concept of "narrative space" explores how space functions within the narrative structure.

## 6. **Time**
   - **Temporal Structures**
     - **Order**: The arrangement of events within the narrative, which may not always be chronological (e.g., flashbacks, flashforwards).
     - **Duration**: The relationship between the time events take within the narrative world and how long they take to tell.
       - **Ellipsis**: Omitting portions of the story to speed up the narrative.
       - **Summary**: Condensing events over a longer period into a brief narrative passage.
       - **Scene**: Depicting events in real-time, often with dialogue.
       - **Stretch**: Expanding a brief moment into a detailed narrative description.
     - **Frequency**: How often events or actions are repeated in the narrative.
       - **Singulative**: An event is narrated once.
       - **Repetitive**: An event is narrated multiple times.
       - **Iterative**: A repeated event is narrated only once, summarizing all occurrences.
   - **Narrative Time**
     - **Anachrony**: Disruptions in the chronological order of the narrative.
       - **Analepsis**: Flashbacks or retrospection.
       - **Prolepsis**: Flashforwards or anticipation.
