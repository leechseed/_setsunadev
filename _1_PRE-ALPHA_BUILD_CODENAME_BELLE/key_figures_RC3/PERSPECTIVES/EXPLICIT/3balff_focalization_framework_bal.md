### 1. Title: **Bal's Focalization Framework**

**Focalization**:
   **Definition**: Mieke Bal’s *Focalization Framework* provides a comprehensive analysis of how perspectives are constructed in narratives. Focalization distinguishes between the *focalizer* (who sees) and the *focalized* (what is seen). This distinction allows for a more nuanced understanding of narrative perspectives, revealing how different viewpoints influence the reader’s interpretation and engagement with the story.

### 2. Key Concepts

#### 2.1. Focalizer

**Definition**:
   The *focalizer* is the entity through whose perspective the narrative events and characters are presented. It can be a character within the story (internal focalizer) or an external narrator (external focalizer).

##### 2.1.1. **Components of Focalizer**  

###### 2.1.1.1. **Internal Focalizer**
  - **Definition**: The narrative is filtered through the subjective perspective of a character within the story, reflecting their thoughts, emotions, and biases.
  - **Characteristics**
    - **Subjective Interpretation**: Provides a personal and emotionally driven account of events, shaped by the focal character’s beliefs and feelings.
    - **Limited Knowledge**: Restricts the reader’s view to what the focal character knows or perceives, creating potential bias or incomplete understanding.
    - **Emotional Depth**: Adds richness to the story by revealing the internal conflicts and motivations of the character, enhancing reader empathy.

###### 2.1.1.2. **External Focalizer**
  - **Definition**: The story is presented by an external narrator who offers a broader, more objective view of events.
  - **Characteristics**
    - **Objective Perspective**: Describes the story with detachment, focusing on actions and dialogue without delving into characters’ inner thoughts.
    - **Wider Scope**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the plot, giving readers access to information beyond the awareness of any single character.
    - **Neutral Tone**: Maintains an impartial narrative voice, allowing readers to interpret the story without direct emotional influence from the narrator.

###### 2.1.1.3. **Variable Focalization**
  - **Definition**: The narrative shifts between different focalizers, providing multiple perspectives on events and characters.
  - **Characteristics**
    - **Diverse Viewpoints**: Offers insights from different characters, enriching the narrative by showing how various individuals perceive and react to events.
    - **Complex Characterization**: Reveals contrasting interpretations and biases, deepening the reader’s understanding of characters and their relationships.
    - **Dynamic Storytelling**: Creates a layered and multifaceted narrative structure, enhancing the reader’s engagement and comprehension of the story’s themes and conflicts.
ariable Focalization**: The narrative shifts between different focalizers, providing multiple perspectives on events and characters.

#### 2.2. Focalized

**Definition**:
   The *focalized* refers to the object, character, or event that is perceived by the focalizer. It is what the focalizer focuses on within the narrative.

##### 2.2.1. **Components of Focalized**     

###### 2.2.1.1. **Characters**
  - **Definition**: The focalized can be another character, whose portrayal is shaped by the focalizer’s perspective.
  - **Characteristics**
    - **Subjective Portrayal**: The focalizer’s emotions, biases, and relationships influence how the character is depicted, adding depth and complexity.
    - **Insight and Interpretation**: Provides unique insights into the focalized character, revealing traits or motives that might not be evident through objective narration.
    - **Layered Relationships**: Demonstrates how characters perceive and interact with each other, highlighting dynamics and conflicts within the story.

###### 2.2.1.2. **Events**
  - **Definition**: Events in the narrative can also be focalized, with the focalizer determining how these events are presented.
  - **Characteristics**
    - **Emphasized Details**: The focalizer’s focus determines which aspects of the event are highlighted or minimized, shaping the reader’s understanding.
    - **Emotional Framing**: Infuses events with the focalizer’s emotions and reactions, influencing how readers perceive their importance or impact.
    - **Interpretive Bias**: Presents events through a specific lens, which can lead to different interpretations and create narrative tension or ambiguity.

###### 2.2.1.3. **Objects**
  - **Definition**: Non-human elements like settings or symbols can be focalized, revealing their thematic significance through the focalizer’s perception.
  - **Characteristics**
    - **Symbolic Meaning**: The focalizer’s attention to objects can imbue them with thematic or emotional significance, contributing to the story’s deeper message.
    - **Mood Creation**: The focalizer’s perception of objects and settings can establish the atmosphere or tone of a scene, enhancing the narrative’s ambiance.
    - **Reflective Insight**: Offers a glimpse into the focalizer’s state of mind or perspective, as their focus on certain objects can reveal subconscious thoughts or feelings.
