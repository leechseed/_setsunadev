##### Title: **Bal's Focalization Framework**

**Focalization**:
   **Definition**: Mieke Bal’s *Focalization Framework* provides a comprehensive analysis of how perspectives are constructed in narratives. Focalization distinguishes between the *focalizer* (who sees) and the *focalized* (what is seen). This distinction allows for a more nuanced understanding of narrative perspectives, revealing how different viewpoints influence the reader’s interpretation and engagement with the story.

##### Key Concepts

##### Focalizer

**Definition**:
   The *focalizer* is the entity through whose perspective the narrative events and characters are presented. It can be a character within the story (internal focalizer) or an external narrator (external focalizer).

**Types**:
   - **Internal Focalizer**: The narrative is filtered through the subjective perspective of a character within the story, reflecting their thoughts, emotions, and biases.
   - **External Focalizer**: The story is presented by an external narrator who offers a broader, more objective view of events.
   - **Variable Focalization**: The narrative shifts between different focalizers, providing multiple perspectives on events and characters.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Subjective Influence**: The focalizer controls the reader’s access to information, often filtering events through their personal viewpoint.
   - **Control of Attention**: The focalizer determines which elements of the story are emphasized or minimized, shaping the reader’s focus and emotional engagement.
   - **Bias**: The focalizer’s biases or limitations can influence how characters and events are portrayed, affecting the reader’s interpretation.

**Contextualization**:
   Identifying the focalizer is essential for understanding how narratives shape the reader’s perception. By examining how the focalizer filters information, readers can analyze the biases and subjective influences that color the narrative. Bal’s framework helps uncover the complex ways narratives construct meaning through perspective.

##### Focalized

**Definition**:
   The *focalized* refers to the object, character, or event that is perceived by the focalizer. It is what the focalizer focuses on within the narrative.

**Types**:
   - **Characters**: The focalized can be another character, whose portrayal is shaped by the focalizer’s perspective.
   - **Events**: Events in the narrative can also be focalized, with the focalizer determining how these events are presented.
   - **Objects**: Non-human elements like settings or symbols can be focalized, revealing their thematic significance through the focalizer’s perception.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Subjectivity of Perception**: The focalized is depicted based on the focalizer’s viewpoint, which may lead to different interpretations depending on who the focalizer is.
   - **Dynamic Interaction**: The portrayal of the focalized can change as the focalizer shifts, offering a more complex and layered understanding of characters, events, or objects.
   - **Impact on Interpretation**: How the focalized is presented influences the reader’s perception of the narrative, often revealing deeper themes or hidden conflicts.

**Contextualization**:
   By distinguishing between the focalizer and the focalized, Bal’s framework allows for a deeper exploration of how narratives manipulate perspective. This distinction helps readers analyze power dynamics in the narrative—who controls the gaze, what is emphasized, and how characters or events are portrayed.

##### Implications of **Focalization**

**Narrative Structure and Perspective**:
   Bal’s *Focalization Framework* has had a profound impact on narrative theory, offering a precise method for analyzing how perspectives are constructed in narratives. Her framework has enhanced the understanding of how subjective viewpoints shape the reader’s engagement with the story.

**Application Across Genres and Media**:
   While developed in the context of literary analysis, Bal’s framework applies across various media, such as film, theater, and digital storytelling. In these media, focalization shapes how the audience experiences the narrative, guiding attention and interpretation.
