##### Title: **Chatman's Narrative Communication Model**

**Narrative Communication**:
   **Definition**: Seymour Chatman’s *Narrative Communication Model* provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the intricate relationships between the various agents involved in both the creation and reception of a narrative. This model identifies key participants in the narrative process, including the *real author*, *implied author*, *narrator*, *narratee*, *implied reader*, and *real reader*. Chatman’s model emphasizes that narrative communication is a complex, layered process in which each agent plays a distinct role in shaping the narrative and its interpretation.

##### Key Concepts

##### Real Author

**Definition**:
   The *real author* is the actual, living person who creates the narrative, writing the text with their own intentions, beliefs, and experiences.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Personal Identity**: The real author exists outside the text, and their personal life may influence their work, but they are not directly accessible through the narrative.
   - **Intentionality**: The real author’s personal goals, beliefs, and circumstances may shape the themes and content of the narrative.
   - **Distinct from Implied Author**: While the real author creates the narrative, the implied author represents the version of the author constructed by the reader.

---

##### Implied Author

**Definition**:
   The *implied author* is the abstract version of the author that the reader infers from the narrative. It is a persona that embodies the values, tone, and style suggested by the text.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Constructed Persona**: The implied author is not the real author but a narrative construct inferred by the reader.
   - **Ethical and Stylistic Guide**: The implied author represents the values and attitudes that guide the narrative, helping to convey its thematic concerns.
   - **Tone and Style**: The implied author shapes how the reader interprets the story through the narrative’s style, moral stance, and presentation of events.

**Contextualization**:
   The implied author allows readers to focus on the narrative voice and moral framework presented in the text, separate from the real author’s personal beliefs or life.

##### Narrator

**Definition**:
   The *narrator* is the voice or entity within the text that tells the story, presenting the events and guiding the reader’s understanding of the narrative.

**Types**:
   - **First-Person Narrator**: A character within the story recounting personal experiences.
   - **Third-Person Narrator**: An external voice providing a more detached or omniscient perspective.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Narrative Voice**: The narrator’s role is to recount the events and provide commentary or insight into the story.
   - **Reliability**: The narrator may be reliable or unreliable, influencing how the reader interprets the events of the narrative.
   - **Perspective**: The narrator shapes the story’s tone, offering an internal (first-person) or external (third-person) viewpoint.

**Contextualization**:
   The narrator’s reliability and perspective play a crucial role in determining how the reader engages with the story, especially in terms of trust and emotional connection.

---

##### Narratee

**Definition**:
   The *narratee* is the imagined audience within the text to whom the narrator addresses the story. This entity may be explicitly mentioned or implied by the tone and style of the narration.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Internal Audience**: The narratee exists within the narrative structure and shapes the way the narrator tells the story.
   - **Influences Narrative Tone**: The relationship between narrator and narratee affects how much information is revealed and the tone of the narration.
   - **Varied Presence**: The narratee may be directly addressed, or implied based on how the story is told (e.g., formal, conversational, etc.).

**Contextualization**:
   The narratee is key in shaping the tone of the narrative and guiding the structure of the story, revealing insights into the narrative’s style and intended impact on the reader.

##### Implied Reader

**Definition**:
   The *implied reader* is the hypothetical, ideal reader that the narrative seems to be addressing. This reader is constructed by the text and represents the audience anticipated by the narrative’s structure and style.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Idealized Audience**: The implied reader is assumed to understand the narrative’s nuances, themes, and values.
   - **Guided Engagement**: The narrative anticipates a specific type of reader response, aiming to guide the implied reader toward particular interpretations or emotional reactions.
   - **Narrative Alignment**: The implied reader’s values and expectations align with the narrative’s intended message and ethical stance.

**Contextualization**:
   The implied reader represents the ideal audience the narrative aims to engage, and analyzing this concept helps explain how texts guide interpretation and response.

---

##### Real Reader

**Definition**:
   The *real reader* is the actual person who reads the text, bringing their own experiences, interpretations, and responses to the narrative.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Personal Background**: The real reader’s unique background influences how they engage with and interpret the text.
   - **Diverse Interpretations**: Unlike the implied reader, the real reader may interpret the text in ways that diverge from the narrative’s expectations.
   - **Active Engagement**: The real reader plays an active role in shaping their understanding of the narrative, which may differ from the intended or implied reading.

**Contextualization**:
   The real reader’s interaction with the text can lead to varied interpretations, and this distinction helps explore how personal context affects narrative reception and understanding.

##### Implications of **Narrative Communication**

**Impact on Narrative Theory**:
   Chatman’s *Narrative Communication Model* has had a profound impact on narrative theory, providing a structured approach to understanding how narratives are constructed and received. By defining the roles of the real author, implied author, narrator, narratee, implied reader, and real reader, Chatman allows for a more precise analysis of how meaning is conveyed and interpreted in storytelling.

**Application Across Media**:
   Chatman’s concepts are applicable across various media, including film, theater, and digital narratives. In these formats, understanding the distinctions between authorial roles and reader/viewer responses enhances insight into how narratives are constructed and consumed.
