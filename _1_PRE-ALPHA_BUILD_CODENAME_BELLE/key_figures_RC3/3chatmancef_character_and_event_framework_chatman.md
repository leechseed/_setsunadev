Summary: "Seymour Chatman's Character and Event Framework distinguishes between *kernel* and *satellite* characters and events, identifying *kernel* elements as crucial to the plot's progression, while *satellites* provide additional context and enrichment. This model is vital for analyzing narrative structure and understanding how different components contribute to the story's development and thematic depth."

### Title: **Chatman's Character and Event Framework**

- **Character and Event**:
  - **Definition**: In *"Story and Discourse"* (1978), Seymour Chatman presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing narratives, focusing on the roles of characters and events within a story. He categorizes characters into *kernel* and *satellite* types and distinguishes between *kernels* (major plot events) and *satellites* (minor events). This framework is crucial for understanding the hierarchical structure of narratives and how different components contribute to the overall development and progression of the story.

  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Kernel Characters**:
      - **Definition**: Kernel characters are those who are essential to the progression of the plot. These characters are central to the story’s main events and are crucial in driving the narrative forward. Kernel characters are involved in critical turning points and major decisions that shape the course of the narrative.
      - **Characteristics**:
        - **Central to the Plot**: Kernel characters are often the protagonists, antagonists, or other primary figures whose actions and decisions significantly impact the narrative’s direction.
        - **Involved in Major Events**: These characters are directly involved in the key events that define the narrative structure, such as pivotal conflicts, resolutions, and turning points.
        - **Essential for Story Progression**: The actions of kernel characters are necessary for the narrative to move forward. Without these characters, the story would lose its primary driving force.
      - **Contextualization**:
        - The identification of kernel characters is crucial for understanding the core dynamics of a narrative. By focusing on these characters, one can trace the main plotline and understand the key drivers of the story’s progression. Kernel characters are typically the ones who experience significant development, face major challenges, and undergo transformations that are central to the narrative’s resolution.
      - **Supporting Information**:
        - **Examples**:
          - **Jay Gatsby in *The Great Gatsby***: Gatsby’s pursuit of Daisy and the events surrounding his rise and fall are central to the plot, making him a kernel character.
          - **Hamlet in *Hamlet***: Hamlet’s actions, decisions, and internal struggles drive the narrative, making him essential to the story’s progression.

    - **Satellite Characters**:
      - **Definition**: Satellite characters serve supplementary roles within the narrative. While they add depth, context, and complexity to the story, their actions are not critical to the plot’s forward movement. Satellite characters often support the kernel characters, provide subplots, or enhance the thematic richness of the narrative.
      - **Characteristics**:
        - **Supportive Role**: Satellite characters typically support the main characters or the narrative’s themes. They might provide background information, comic relief, or additional perspectives on the central events.
        - **Not Essential to the Plot**: The narrative could theoretically proceed without the involvement of satellite characters. Their actions and decisions do not significantly alter the main storyline.
        - **Enrichment of the Narrative**: These characters contribute to the overall texture of the story, making it more layered and complex. They help to flesh out the world of the narrative, providing a richer context for the main events and characters.
      - **Contextualization**:
        - Satellite characters are important for adding depth to the narrative, even though they are not central to the plot. By exploring the roles of satellite characters, one can gain a deeper understanding of the narrative’s thematic elements, secondary plots, and character interactions. These characters often help to build the world of the story and provide a fuller picture of the social, cultural, or emotional landscape in which the main events unfold.
      - **Supporting Information**:
        - **Examples**:
          - **Jordan Baker in *The Great Gatsby***: Jordan provides context for the main plot and offers insight into the social world of the novel, but her actions are not central to the story’s progression.
          - **Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in *Hamlet***: These characters serve to provide additional context and thematic exploration, but their presence does not directly impact the main plot trajectory.

    - **Kernel and Satellite Events**:
      - **Definition**: Chatman also categorizes events within a narrative as either kernels or satellites. Kernels are major plot events that are crucial to the narrative’s forward movement. They represent the turning points or essential actions that define the structure of the story. Satellites, in contrast, are minor events that provide additional context, background, or elaboration but do not significantly impact the main plot.
      - **Characteristics**:
        - **Kernel Events**: These events are the backbone of the narrative. They are the moments where significant decisions are made, conflicts are introduced or resolved, and the direction of the story is determined. Kernel events are indispensable to the narrative’s structure and progression.
        - **Satellite Events**: Satellite events offer supplementary details that enhance the narrative but are not crucial to the plot. These events might explore character backstories, develop subplots, or provide thematic richness, but the removal of these events would not disrupt the main storyline.
      - **Contextualization**:
        - Understanding the distinction between kernel and satellite events is vital for a nuanced analysis of how narratives are structured. Kernels dictate the pace and trajectory of the story, while satellites enrich the narrative by adding layers of meaning, character development, or thematic depth. This distinction allows for a more detailed examination of how different events contribute to the overall narrative, helping to identify which moments are pivotal and which serve more supportive, albeit still significant, roles.
      - **Supporting Information**:
        - **Examples**:
          - **Kernel Event**: In *Hamlet* by William Shakespeare, Hamlet’s decision to stage the play "The Mousetrap" is a kernel event that significantly advances the plot by confirming Claudius’s guilt and setting the course for the tragic conclusion.
          - **Satellite Event**: In the same play, the gravedigger scene serves as a satellite event. While it provides thematic depth and explores the concept of mortality, it does not directly impact the main plot.

  - **Theoretical Significance**:
    - **Impact on Narrative Theory**: Chatman’s Character and Event Framework has had a significant impact on narrative theory, particularly in the analysis of plot structure and character development. By distinguishing between kernel and satellite elements, Chatman’s framework provides a systematic way to analyze the complexity and hierarchy within narratives. This approach has been influential in both literary studies and media analysis, offering tools to dissect how stories are constructed and how different components interact to create meaning.
    - **Application Across Media**: While originally developed for literary analysis, Chatman’s framework is also applicable to other narrative forms, including film, television, and video games. In these mediums, the distinction between kernel and satellite elements can help to analyze the pacing, narrative focus, and character dynamics, offering insights into how different storytelling techniques are employed across various formats.
    - **Supporting Information**:
      - **Interdisciplinary Influence**: Chatman’s framework has influenced disciplines beyond literary studies, including film studies, where it is used to analyze screenplays and cinematic storytelling. In game studies, the distinction between kernel and satellite elements is useful for understanding branching narratives and player agency.
      - **Criticism and Adaptation**: Some critics have argued that the binary distinction between kernels and satellites may oversimplify the complexity of certain narratives, especially those that intentionally blur the lines between major and minor elements. However, subsequent scholars have expanded on Chatman’s ideas, adapting them to accommodate more fluid and complex narrative structures, particularly in postmodern and experimental works.
