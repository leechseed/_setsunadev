Summary: "Chatman’s Story vs. Discourse framework distinguishes between *story* (the content: events, characters, and settings) and *discourse* (the presentation: narrative voice, order of events, and style), providing a crucial tool for analyzing how narratives are structured and experienced across different media."

### **Chatman's Story vs. Discourse Framework**

- **Author**: Seymour Chatman
- **Title**: Chatman's Story vs. Discourse Framework---
### **Story vs. Discourse**

- **Definition**: Seymour Chatman, a prominent narratologist, introduces a critical distinction between *story* and *discourse* in his analysis of narrative. This distinction is foundational for understanding how narratives function across different media, particularly in literature and film.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **Story**

- **Definition**: 
  - The *story* is the content of the narrative—essentially the *what* of the narrative. It includes all the events, characters, settings, and actions that make up the plot. The story is the raw material, existing independently of how it is narrated or presented to the audience.
- **Components of Story**:
  - **Events**: The incidents or occurrences that drive the narrative forward.
  - **Characters**: The individuals or entities that participate in the events.
  - **Settings**: The time and place where the events occur.
  - **Actions**: The behaviors and decisions made by characters that influence the course of events.
- **Contextualization**:
  - The *story* provides the fundamental building blocks of a narrative. It is the *substratum* of the narrative, the series of events and elements that can be arranged and rearranged to form different narratives. 
  - In different adaptations (e.g., from novel to film), the story remains constant while the discourse might change. For example, the story of "Cinderella" includes her life with her stepmother, the prince’s ball, and the lost slipper—these remain the same across versions, but the way the story is told (the discourse) varies.
  - **Importance**: The story is what allows different versions of a narrative to share a common thread despite differences in presentation, medium, or style.

#### **Discourse**

- **Definition**:
  - *Discourse* refers to the *how* of the narrative—the structure and technique used to tell the story. It encompasses the narrative voice, the order of events, the focalization, the style, and the medium used to convey the narrative.
- **Components of Discourse**:
  - **Narrative Voice**: Who tells the story and how it is narrated (first-person, third-person, omniscient, etc.).
  - **Focalization**: The perspective from which the story is viewed or narrated (whose eyes we see the events through).
  - **Order of Events**: How the events are sequenced in the narrative (chronologically, through flashbacks, etc.).
  - **Style**: The language, tone, and literary devices used in the narrative.
  - **Medium**: The format through which the story is conveyed (text, film, graphic novel, etc.).
- **Contextualization**:
  - The *discourse* shapes the audience’s experience of the story. It controls not just what the audience knows but also how and when they learn it, thereby influencing the interpretation and emotional response to the narrative.
  - Discourse can manipulate time, alter perspectives, and create suspense or surprise by controlling the flow of information.
  - **Examples**:
    - In a film, the choice of camera angles, editing, and sound design are elements of discourse.
    - In literature, the use of stream-of-consciousness, unreliable narrators, or non-linear timelines are discourse strategies that alter the audience’s engagement with the story.
  - **Importance**: Understanding discourse is crucial for analyzing narrative strategies. It reveals how narratives guide interpretation, evoke emotions, and convey themes beyond the basic events of the story.

### **Importance of the Distinction**

- **Narrative Analysis**:
  - Chatman’s distinction between story and discourse allows for a deeper analysis of how narratives function. By separating the *what* from the *how*, critics and scholars can explore the effects of different narrative techniques on the audience’s experience and understanding of the narrative.
  - It highlights the versatility of narrative content—how the same story can be transformed through various discursive techniques to produce different meanings and effects.
  
- **Media Adaptation**:
  - The story vs. discourse distinction is particularly relevant in the study of media adaptations (e.g., from book to film). While the story may remain consistent, the discourse changes significantly, impacting how the narrative is received and interpreted in different media.
  
- **Broader Implications**:
  - This framework can be applied beyond literature and film to any form of storytelling, including oral narratives, video games, and digital media, making it a universal tool for narrative analysis.

### **Conclusion**

- **Seymour Chatman’s Framework**:
  - The distinction between story and discourse is fundamental to understanding narrative structure. It allows for a clear analysis of the *content* versus the *presentation* of a narrative, providing insights into how different storytelling techniques shape the audience’s experience.
  - By recognizing this distinction, one can better appreciate the artistry involved in storytelling across various media and how narratives engage, influence, and affect their audiences.
