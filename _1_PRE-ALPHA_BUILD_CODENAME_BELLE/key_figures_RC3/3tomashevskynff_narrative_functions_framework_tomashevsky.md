### Title: **Tomashevsky's Narrative Functions Framework**

- **Narrative Functions**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky’s analysis of narrative functions focuses on the role that different elements of the narrative play in advancing the plot and developing the theme. He categorizes these functions into two types: *bound motifs* and *free motifs*.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **Bound Motifs**

- **Definition**:
  - Bound motifs are essential to the progression of the narrative. They are necessary for the development of the plot and cannot be removed without altering the narrative’s core structure.

- **Contextualization**:
  - Bound motifs drive the story forward, ensuring that the narrative maintains its logical sequence and coherence. They are the key events or actions that shape the narrative’s trajectory. Without these motifs, the story would lose its fundamental structure, leading to a breakdown in the narrative’s logical flow.

- **Examples**:
  - In *Macbeth* by William Shakespeare, the prophecies of the witches are bound motifs, as they are critical to Macbeth's actions and the overall progression of the plot. Removing these prophecies would fundamentally alter the narrative, as they are central to Macbeth's descent into tyranny and madness.

#### **Free Motifs**

- **Definition**:
  - Free motifs are not essential to the plot but contribute to the atmosphere, characterization, or thematic depth of the narrative. They enrich the story by adding layers of meaning and emotional resonance.

- **Contextualization**:
  - Free motifs enhance the narrative’s aesthetic and thematic qualities, providing additional context or emotional impact without altering the main plotline. These motifs can include symbolic elements, background details, or subplots that deepen the reader's understanding of the characters or themes. While they do not drive the narrative forward, they add richness and texture, making the story more engaging and multifaceted.

- **Examples**:
  - In *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the recurring motif of the green light at the end of Daisy's dock is a free motif. While it is not essential to the plot's progression, it adds symbolic meaning, representing Gatsby's unattainable dreams and the broader themes of desire and the American Dream. Removing this motif would not change the sequence of events, but it would diminish the thematic depth of the narrative.
