### Title: **Tomashevsky's Defamiliarization Model**

**Defamiliarization (Ostranenie)**:
   **Definition**: Tomashevsky expanded on the concept of defamiliarization, originally introduced by Viktor Shklovsky, which involves presenting common objects, events, or experiences in a way that makes them appear unfamiliar or strange. This technique is designed to disrupt the reader's automatic perception, forcing them to engage more deeply with the text and to see the world in a new light.

### Key Concepts

#### **Narrative Defamiliarization**

**Definition**:
   Narrative defamiliarization refers to the use of unconventional narrative structures to challenge the reader’s usual way of understanding stories. By altering familiar storytelling conventions, such as chronology or perspective, authors disrupt expectations and encourage readers to engage with the narrative in new ways.

##### **Components of Narrative Defamiliariation**

**Characteristics**:
   - **Non-Linear Storytelling**: Breaks the chronological sequence of events, creating a fragmented or layered narrative that prompts readers to piece together the story themselves.
   - **Shifts in Perspective**: Employs changes in narrative voice or point of view to create disorientation or highlight different interpretations of the story.
   - **Structural Innovation**: Uses experimental formats or structures, such as stream-of-consciousness or nested narratives, to engage readers in a unique storytelling experience.

#### **Thematic Defamiliarization**

**Definition**:
   Thematic defamiliarization involves the inclusion of unexpected or unconventional thematic elements that challenge traditional interpretations or reader expectations. This technique forces readers to reconsider the underlying messages and ideas presented in the narrative.

##### **Components of Thematic Defamiliarization**

**Characteristics**:
   - **Subversion of Expectations**: Introduces themes that go against conventional norms, prompting readers to question established beliefs or perspectives.
   - **Layered Meaning**: Integrates complex or abstract themes that require deeper analysis and interpretation, moving beyond simple or familiar ideas.
   - **Reflective Engagement**: Encourages readers to critically think about the narrative’s themes, fostering a more active and contemplative reading experience.

### Implications of Tomashevsky’s Defamiliarization Model

- Tomashevsky’s extension of defamiliarization into narrative and thematic elements provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how literature can challenge and transform the reader's perceptions. By making the familiar strange, defamiliarization not only revitalizes the reader’s experience of the text but also encourages deeper engagement with its themes and structures. This approach has had a significant impact on modern and postmodern literary practices, where the subversion of traditional forms and expectations is often central to the artistic intent. Through defamiliarization, literature becomes a space for innovation and critical reflection, pushing the boundaries of how stories are told and understood.
