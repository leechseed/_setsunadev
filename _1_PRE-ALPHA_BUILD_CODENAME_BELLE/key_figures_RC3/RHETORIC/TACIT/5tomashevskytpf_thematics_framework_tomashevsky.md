### 1. Title: **Tomashevsky's Thematics and Poetics Framework**

**Thematics and Poetics**:
   **Definition**: Boris Tomashevsky's framework integrates the study of *thematics*—the exploration of themes, motifs, and ideas within a text—into the broader field of *poetics*, which focuses on the formal analysis of literary texts. He argues that thematics is essential for understanding how narratives function as artistic constructs, emphasizing the interplay between theme and structure in creating meaning.

##### 2.4.1. Implications of Thematics and Poetics

**Key Insight**:
   Tomashevsky's framework shows that themes are not abstract ideas isolated from narrative structure; rather, they are deeply integrated into the form of a narrative, influencing its progression, character development, and emotional resonance.
