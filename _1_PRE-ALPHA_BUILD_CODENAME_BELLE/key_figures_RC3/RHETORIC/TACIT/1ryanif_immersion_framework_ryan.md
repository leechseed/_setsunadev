### Title: **Ryan's Immersion Framework**

**Immersion**:
   **Definition**: Marie-Laure Ryan defines *immersion* as the experience of being transported into a fictional world, where the reader or viewer becomes fully absorbed in the narrative. In her work *"Narrative as Virtual Reality,"* she explores how different media—literature, film, video games, and virtual reality—create immersive experiences.

### Key Concepts

#### Traditional vs. Digital Narratives

**Definition**:
   Ryan differentiates between traditional and digital narratives in how they achieve immersion. Traditional narratives, such as those found in literature, rely heavily on the reader’s imagination to create a sense of immersion. In contrast, digital and virtual narratives, such as those in video games or virtual reality, achieve immersion through sensory engagement and interactivity, allowing the audience to experience the fictional world more directly.

#### Traditional Narratives

##### **Components of Traditional Narratives**

**Imaginative Immersion**:
   Traditional narratives rely on language to evoke images, emotions, and sensations. Readers engage with the text, visualizing the world and characters through imagination. This process allows for personal engagement as each reader’s interpretation is unique.

**Narrative Techniques**:
   - **Descriptive Language**: Detailed descriptions help readers visualize the story’s world.
   - **Emotional Resonance**: Relatable characters and emotional depth foster a connection between reader and narrative.
   - **Suspense and Pacing**: Gradual unfolding of events keeps readers engaged.

**Reader's Role**:
   - **Active Participation**: Readers mentally construct the narrative world, infer meaning, and invest emotionally.
   - **Cultural and Personal Context**: Personal experiences shape how readers interpret the narrative.

**Challenges and Limitations**:
   - **Variability in Immersion**: Immersion varies between readers based on their ability to visualize or relate to the narrative.
   - **Cognitive Demands**: Traditional narratives require cognitive effort, which can either enhance or hinder immersion.
