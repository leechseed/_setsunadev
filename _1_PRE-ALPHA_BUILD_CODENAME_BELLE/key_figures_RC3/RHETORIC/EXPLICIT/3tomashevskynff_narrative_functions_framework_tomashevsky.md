### 1. Title: **Tomashevsky's Narrative Functions Framework**

**Narrative Functions**:
   **Definition**: Tomashevsky’s framework categorizes narrative elements into two main types: *bound motifs* and *free motifs*. These motifs serve distinct purposes within a narrative: bound motifs are crucial for advancing the plot, while free motifs enhance the thematic and emotional layers of the story without being essential to its progression.

##### 2.2.2. Implications of Narrative Functions

**Understanding Story Structure**:
   Tomashevsky’s framework helps distinguish between elements that are structurally essential to the plot and those that enhance the thematic and emotional layers of the narrative. By recognizing bound and free motifs, readers gain insight into the mechanics of storytelling and can better appreciate the craftsmanship involved in narrative construction.

**Applications in Literary Analysis**:
   This framework is valuable for identifying which elements drive the plot and which serve to enrich the narrative’s meaning and atmosphere. Analyzing both bound and free motifs allows for a deeper understanding of how authors create complex, multi-layered stories that balance essential events with symbolic or thematic details.
