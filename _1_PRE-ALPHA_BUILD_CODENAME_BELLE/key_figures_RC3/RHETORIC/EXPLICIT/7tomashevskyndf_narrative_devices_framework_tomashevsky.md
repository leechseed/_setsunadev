##### Title: **Tomashevsky's Narrative Devices Framework**

##### Key Concepts

##### Irony

**Definition**:
   Irony is a narrative device that creates a contrast between expectations and reality, or between what is said and what is meant. It often leads to humor, tension, or critique by highlighting discrepancies in the narrative.

**Types**:
   - **Verbal Irony**: When the intended meaning of a statement contrasts with its literal meaning.
     - **Example**: In *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen, Mr. Bennet’s sarcastic remarks often mask his true feelings, creating a contrast between his words and his actual intent.
  
   - **Situational Irony**: When there is a discrepancy between what is expected to happen and what actually occurs.
     - **Example**: In *The Gift of the Magi* by O. Henry, a couple sacrifices their most valued possessions to buy gifts for each other, but the gifts become useless, highlighting the irony of their sacrifice.
  
   - **Dramatic Irony**: When the audience or reader knows something that the characters do not, creating tension or humor.
     - **Example**: In *Romeo and Juliet* by Shakespeare, the audience knows Juliet is alive, but Romeo believes she is dead, leading to tragic consequences.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Contrast between Appearance and Reality**: Irony relies on the reader’s awareness of a gap between expectations and reality.
   - **Tension and Engagement**: Irony creates suspense or humor, making the narrative more engaging by involving the reader in deciphering hidden meanings.
   - **Subversive Commentary**: Often, irony serves to critique societal norms or characters' actions by revealing contradictions.

**Contextualization**:
   Irony is a powerful tool for deepening narrative complexity, challenging readers to look beyond the surface of the text. By contrasting expectations with reality, irony encourages readers to engage more critically with the story and its themes.

##### Allegory

**Definition**:
   Allegory is a narrative technique in which characters, events, or settings symbolize broader abstract ideas or moral, political, or social messages. It often uses extended metaphors to convey a deeper or hidden meaning throughout the text.

**Types**:
   - **Moral Allegory**: A story that teaches a moral lesson.
     - **Example**: In *The Pilgrim’s Progress* by John Bunyan, the protagonist’s journey represents the Christian path to salvation.

   - **Political Allegory**: A narrative that represents political ideas or events.
     - **Example**: George Orwell’s *Animal Farm* is a political allegory for the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism, where the farm animals symbolize different political factions.

   - **Religious Allegory**: A story that represents religious principles or beliefs.
     - **Example**: In C.S. Lewis’s *The Chronicles of Narnia*, Aslan’s sacrifice is an allegory for Christ’s death and resurrection.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Extended Metaphor**: Allegories function through sustained metaphors that run throughout the entire narrative.
   - **Multi-Layered Meaning**: The literal story represents a deeper, often hidden, level of meaning.
   - **Didactic Purpose**: Allegories often aim to teach a lesson or convey a message beyond the plot.

**Contextualization**:
   Allegory allows authors to explore complex ideas, such as morality, politics, or religion, through symbolic storytelling. This device invites readers to think critically about the broader significance of the narrative and the lessons it imparts.

##### Symbolism

**Definition**:
   Symbolism involves using objects, characters, or actions to represent abstract concepts or ideas, imbuing them with additional meaning beyond their literal interpretation. Symbols often carry thematic weight, contributing to the narrative’s depth and complexity.

**Types**:
   - **Personal Symbolism**: Objects or actions that carry significance for a specific character.
     - **Example**: In *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock represents Gatsby’s unattainable dreams and the American Dream.

   - **Cultural Symbolism**: Symbols that represent larger cultural or societal themes.
     - **Example**: In *Moby-Dick* by Herman Melville, the white whale symbolizes the destructive obsession and the unknowable forces of nature.

   - **Universal Symbolism**: Symbols that carry meaning across different cultures and contexts.
     - **Example**: The tree is often a universal symbol of life, growth, and connection to the natural world.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Abstract Representation**: Symbols encapsulate broader themes or ideas, often standing in for complex concepts that transcend their literal function.
   - **Thematic Enhancement**: Symbolism enriches the narrative by adding layers of meaning, allowing readers to engage with the text on a deeper level.
   - **Evocative Imagery**: Symbols often use strong, vivid imagery to evoke emotional or intellectual responses from the reader.

**Contextualization**:
   Symbolism helps to add emotional and intellectual depth to a narrative. By linking specific objects or actions to larger themes, symbolism provides a way for authors to subtly communicate ideas and messages without explicitly stating them.
