Summary: Marie-Laure Ryan's *Narrative as a Cognitive Construct* framework views narrative as a mental model shaped by reader interaction with the text. In digital narratives, this engagement is heightened through interactivity and non-linear structures, positioning the reader as a co-creator of meaning, a concept that bridges narrative theory and cognitive science.
ELEMENT: RHETORIC
PROPERTY: INTERTEXTUALITY

### Title: **Ryan's Narrative as a Cognitive Construct Framework**

- **Narrative as a Cognitive Construct**:
  - **Definition**: Marie-Laure Ryan proposes that narrative is fundamentally a cognitive construct, meaning that it is not just a text but also a mental model formed in the reader’s mind. This model is shaped by the interaction between the narrative's structure and the reader’s cognitive processes, including perception, memory, and imagination. According to Ryan, the act of reading or experiencing a narrative involves the construction of a mental simulation or world, where the reader actively participates in the creation of meaning.
  
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Cognitive Engagement in Digital Narratives**:
      - **Definition**: Ryan explores how digital narratives, with their interactive and immersive features, engage the reader’s cognitive faculties in new ways. Unlike traditional linear narratives, digital narratives often allow readers to influence the direction of the story, thus creating a more dynamic and participatory relationship between the narrative and its audience.
      - **Characteristics**:
        - **Interactivity**: Digital narratives often require the reader to make choices that influence the story's outcome, making the reading experience more engaging and personalized.
        - **Immersion**: The use of multimedia elements, such as visuals, sound, and hypertext, can create a more immersive experience, drawing the reader deeper into the narrative world.
        - **Non-Linear Structure**: Many digital narratives feature non-linear structures, where the sequence of events can vary based on the reader's decisions, leading to multiple possible storylines or endings.
      - **Contextualization**:
        - Ryan's framework highlights the cognitive dimension of narrative interaction, particularly in digital contexts where the reader's active participation can significantly shape the story's progression and meaning. This cognitive engagement goes beyond mere interpretation, involving decision-making, problem-solving, and the use of imagination to navigate complex narrative environments. The reader becomes a co-creator of the narrative, and their mental model of the story evolves as they interact with the text.
      - **Supporting Information**:
        - **Examples**:
          - **Interactive Fiction**: In interactive fiction, such as *Choose Your Own Adventure* books or digital games like *The Walking Dead* series, the reader/player makes decisions that directly impact the narrative's direction and outcome. These choices require the reader to anticipate possible consequences and actively shape their understanding of the story.
          - **Hypertext Fiction**: In hypertext fiction, like Michael Joyce's *afternoon, a story*, the reader navigates the narrative through hyperlinks, creating a unique path through the text that can differ with each reading. This non-linear approach requires the reader to construct the narrative actively, piecing together different fragments to form a coherent story.
    
  - **Theoretical Significance**:
    - **Reader-Text Interaction**: Ryan’s model emphasizes the active role of the reader in the creation of narrative meaning. It challenges traditional views of narrative as a fixed structure that the reader passively consumes, instead proposing that narrative is an interactive and dynamic process shaped by the reader's cognitive engagement.
    - **Impact on Digital Narrative Studies**: Ryan’s framework is particularly influential in the study of digital narratives, where the boundaries between author, text, and reader are often blurred. Her work helps to explain how digital media transform the reader's role, making narrative a more participatory and personalized experience.
    - **Cognitive Science and Narrative**: By framing narrative as a cognitive construct, Ryan’s work bridges the gap between narrative theory and cognitive science. It suggests that understanding narratives requires not only analyzing their textual structures but also considering how they are processed and constructed in the reader's mind.
    - **Supporting Information**:
      - **Cross-Disciplinary Influence**: Ryan’s ideas have been influential across various fields, including literature, media studies, and cognitive science. Her emphasis on the cognitive aspects of narrative engagement has opened new avenues for research into how narratives are experienced differently in digital and interactive formats.
      - **Critiques and Expansions**: While Ryan’s framework has been widely praised for its insights into digital narratives, some critics argue that it may overlook the social and cultural dimensions of narrative interaction. However, subsequent theorists have expanded on her work to incorporate these elements, making her cognitive approach a foundational component of contemporary narrative theory.
