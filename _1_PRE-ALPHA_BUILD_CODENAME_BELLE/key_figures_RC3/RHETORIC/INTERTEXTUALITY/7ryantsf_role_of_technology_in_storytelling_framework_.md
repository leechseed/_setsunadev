      - **Definition**: Ryan’s exploration of the technological influence on narrative focuses on how new media technologies present both challenges and opportunities for authors and audiences. These changes, brought about by advancements from print to digital media, have reshaped narrative forms, altered the dynamics of reader engagement, and introduced new modes of interaction with stories.
      - **Characteristics**:
        - **Transformation of Narrative Forms**: Technology has led to the development of new narrative forms, such as hypertext fiction, interactive stories, and transmedia storytelling, which differ significantly from traditional linear narratives. These forms often involve non-linearity, interactivity, and multimedia integration, offering more dynamic and varied storytelling experiences.
        - **Expanded Reader Engagement**: The shift to digital media has expanded the ways in which readers engage with narratives. For example, in interactive digital stories, readers may have the ability to influence the outcome of the narrative, becoming active participants in the storytelling process rather than passive consumers.
        - **New Challenges for Authors**: While technology provides new tools for storytelling, it also introduces challenges for authors. These include the need to adapt to new narrative structures, the complexity of creating interactive content, and the necessity of considering how readers will navigate and interpret non-linear or multimodal narratives.
      - **Contextualization**:
        - Ryan’s framework is crucial for understanding the evolution of storytelling practices in response to technological developments. As storytelling mediums have shifted from print to digital, the structure and nature of narratives have undergone significant transformations. Ryan’s analysis helps to contextualize these changes, offering insights into how technology influences not only the form and content of narratives but also the relationship between the story and its audience.
