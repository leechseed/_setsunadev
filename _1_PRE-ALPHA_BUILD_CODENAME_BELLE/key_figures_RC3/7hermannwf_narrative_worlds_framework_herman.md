### **Key Concepts**

#### **Possible Worlds Theory**

- **Definition**:
  - Herman’s concept of narrative worlds is closely aligned with possible worlds theory, a framework in philosophy and literary theory that explores the idea of multiple, alternate realities. In this context, narrative worlds are seen as self-contained, imagined environments that exist parallel to the real world. These worlds are crafted through the narrative and provide a space where characters interact, events unfold, and themes are explored.

- **Contextualization**:
  - By examining narrative worlds through the lens of possible worlds theory, Herman highlights the imaginative and speculative power of storytelling. This approach emphasizes how narratives can transport readers into alternate realities that challenge their perceptions of the real world. Narrative worlds serve as a medium for authors to explore what-if scenarios, ethical quandaries, and complex human experiences that may not be possible in the actual world.
  
  - Herman’s framework underscores the importance of narrative worlds in engaging readers on a deeper level, allowing them to inhabit and interact with these alternate realities. This immersion fosters empathy, critical thinking, and a greater appreciation for the diversity of human experience.

- **Supporting Information**:
  - **World-Building**:
    - **Definition**: The process of constructing a detailed and coherent narrative world, complete with its own rules, cultures, and histories.
    - **Contextualization**: World-building is a crucial element in the creation of narrative worlds, as it provides the foundation upon which the story is built. Through world-building, authors create environments that feel real and immersive, even if they are entirely fictional or speculative.
    - **Examples**: In *The Lord of the Rings* by J.R.R. Tolkien, the extensive world-building of Middle-earth, with its own languages, histories, and cultures, creates a richly detailed narrative world that has captivated readers for generations.

  - **Immersive Storytelling**:
    - **Definition**: The use of descriptive language, character development, and narrative structure to draw readers into the narrative world, making them feel as though they are part of the story.
    - **Contextualization**: Immersive storytelling is essential for the effectiveness of narrative worlds, as it helps readers to suspend disbelief and fully engage with the fictional reality presented to them. This immersion is often achieved through vivid descriptions, relatable characters, and a consistent narrative logic that makes the world feel plausible.
    - **Examples**: In *Harry Potter* by J.K. Rowling, the detailed descriptions of Hogwarts and the
