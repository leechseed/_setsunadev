### **Propp's 31 Narrative Functions Framework**

- **Vladimir Propp's 31 Narrative Functions**:
  - **Definition**: Vladimir Propp identified 31 narrative functions in his seminal work *"Morphology of the Folktale"*. These functions represent the fundamental building blocks of folktale narratives and typically occur in a fixed sequence.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Fixed Sequence of Events**:
      - **Definition**: The 31 functions follow a specific order in folktales, starting with an initial situation and moving through various stages of conflict, action, and resolution. Each function contributes to the narrative’s progression and the development of the hero’s journey.
      - **Contextualization**: Propp’s framework has been influential in the study of narrative structure, providing a systematic approach to analyzing folktales and identifying common patterns across different cultures and stories. By categorizing these functions, Propp laid the groundwork for understanding the universal elements of storytelling.

### **Propp’s 31 Narrative Functions**

1. **Absentation**:
   - A family member leaves the home or is otherwise absent (e.g., a parent dies or goes away, the hero departs).
   - **Context**: This function sets the stage for the narrative, introducing a lack or absence that often triggers the unfolding of the plot.

2. **Interdiction**:
   - A prohibition or command is given to the hero (e.g., "Do not go into the forest").
   - **Context**: This command establishes a rule or condition that the hero is expected to follow, creating a sense of order that is often disrupted.

3. **Violation of Interdiction**:
   - The interdiction is violated (e.g., the hero disobeys and goes into the forest).
   - **Context**: This violation propels the narrative forward, introducing conflict or danger that the hero must confront.

4. **Reconnaissance**:
   - The villain attempts to gather information about the hero (e.g., spies on the hero, tries to find out about weaknesses).
   - **Context**: This function shows the villain's active role in the narrative, seeking to undermine the hero through knowledge or deception.

5. **Delivery**:
   - The villain receives information about the hero (e.g., finds out where the hero lives or about a secret).
   - **Context**: The villain gains an advantage, setting the stage for further conflict or manipulation.

6. **Trickery**:
   - The villain attempts to deceive the hero (e.g., disguises themselves, pretends to be someone else).
   - **Context**: Deception introduces a psychological element to the narrative, testing the hero's perception and judgment.

7. **Complicity**:
   - The hero is deceived by the villain and unwittingly helps them (e.g., the hero believes the villain’s lies or gives away crucial information).
   - **Context**: This function often deepens the hero’s predicament, leading to greater challenges that must be overcome.

8. **Villainy**:
   - The villain causes harm or injury to a family member (e.g., kidnapping, theft, casting a spell).
   - **Context**: The central conflict is introduced, giving the hero a clear goal or mission—usually to rectify the harm caused by the villain.

9. **Mediation**:
   - The hero becomes aware of the villainy or a lack and is dispatched or receives a call to action (e.g., the hero is told of the loss and sets out to find a solution).
   - **Context**: This function represents the hero’s commitment to the quest, often spurred by a sense of duty or moral obligation.

10. **Counteraction**:
    - The hero decides to act in response to the villainy or lack (e.g., prepares to embark on a quest).
    - **Context**: The hero's decision to take action solidifies their role as the protagonist, setting the narrative in motion.

11. **Departure**:
    - The hero leaves home to begin the quest (e.g., setting out on the journey).
    - **Context**: The journey symbolizes the hero’s transition from the familiar to the unknown, often a rite of passage in the narrative.

12. **First Function of the Donor**:
    - The hero encounters a donor who tests, interrogates, or attacks the hero (e.g., the hero meets a magical helper who challenges them).
    - **Context**: The donor’s test often serves to prove the hero’s worthiness and introduces magical or supernatural elements to the story.

13. **Hero's Reaction**:
    - The hero responds to the actions of the donor, often passing a test or showing kindness (e.g., the hero passes the test, helps the donor, or solves a riddle).
    - **Context**: This response further defines the hero’s character, demonstrating qualities like bravery, intelligence, or compassion.

14. **Acquisition**:
    - The hero receives a magical agent or object as a reward (e.g., a sword, potion, or ring).
    - **Context**: The acquisition of a magical item often provides the hero with the means to overcome future obstacles, symbolizing empowerment.

15. **Guidance**:
    - The hero is led to the whereabouts of the object of the search (e.g., the hero is shown the way to the villain's lair).
    - **Context**: This function often marks a turning point in the quest, as the hero approaches the climax of the narrative.

16. **Struggle**:
    - The hero and the villain engage in direct combat or a battle (e.g., a fight, a contest).
    - **Context**: The struggle represents the physical or metaphorical confrontation between good and evil, often the most intense moment in the narrative.

17. **Branding**:

    - **Context**: The defeat of the villain resolves the central conflict, often restoring order to the narrative world.

19. **Liquidation**:
    - The initial misfortune or lack is resolved (e.g., the hero rescues the victim, retrieves the stolen item, breaks the spell).
    - **Context**: This function marks the narrative’s resolution, addressing the initial problem or quest and bringing the story toward closure.

20. **Return**:
    - The hero starts the journey back home (e.g., begins the return trip).

21. **Pursuit**:
    - The hero is pursued by the villain or another antagonist (e.g., the villain chases the hero to prevent them from returning).
    - **Context**: This function reintroduces tension, often creating a sense of urgency or danger even after the main conflict has been resolved.

22. **Rescue**:
    - The hero is rescued from pursuit or a trap (e.g., is saved by a magical helper or a sudden intervention).

25. **Difficult Task**:
    - A difficult task is proposed to the hero (e.g., a final test or challenge to prove worth).
