**Impact on Literary Theory**:
   Forster’s model has shaped the way character development is analyzed in literary studies. His distinction between flat and round characters offers a useful framework for understanding how different types of characters contribute to the narrative's structure and emotional depth.

  - **Theoretical Significance**:
    - **Impact on Character Analysis**: Forster’s distinction between flat and round characters has had a lasting impact on literary analysis, providing a foundational tool for understanding character construction and its role in narrative fiction. His model helps critics and readers alike to categorize characters and analyze how their complexity—or lack thereof—contributes to the overall narrative.
    - **Application in Various Genres**: While Forster’s concepts are widely applicable across all genres, they are particularly relevant in literary fiction, where character development is often a primary focus. However, the model is also useful in understanding character roles in genre fiction, where flat characters may be more common due to the emphasis on plot and theme.
    - **Supporting Information**:
      - **Literary Criticism and Beyond**: Forster’s model has been influential not only in literary criticism but also in areas such as screenwriting and character design in visual media. Understanding the balance between flat and round characters is essential for creating narratives that are both compelling and thematically coherent.
      - **Critiques and Evolution**: Some critics argue that Forster’s binary distinction oversimplifies character development, suggesting that characters can exhibit traits of both flat and round types. Additionally, contemporary narratives, especially in postmodern literature, often blur these boundaries, creating characters that defy easy categorization. Despite these critiques, Forster’s model remains a key concept in the study of narrative and character development.
