# Ideally, we want each of the elements of narratology to have a robust library of references to build a solid theoretical architecture.

- This requires a number of sources to ascertain a model that is well connected and meaningful.

- STRUCTURE has the most amount of sources with **37**. Understandably, structure is one of the most complex of each of the elements and 30-40 sources should be the ideal amount to build up the library for each element.
