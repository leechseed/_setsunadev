### 1. Title: **Bakhtin's Author and Hero in Aesthetic Activity Concept**

- **Author and Hero in Aesthetic Activity**:
  - **Definition**: In his early work, Mikhail Bakhtin explores the intricate relationship between the author and the hero (or protagonist) in literary works. He delves into how the author constructs the hero’s world, considering not only the creative process but also the ethical implications involved in shaping the character's narrative and actions. This exploration serves as a precursor to Bakhtin's later, more developed theories on dialogism, polyphony, and the ethical dimensions of narrative.

### 2. **Key Concepts**:

#### 2.1. **Authorial Control**:

- **Definition**: Authorial control refers to the power and responsibility the author holds in determining the course of the narrative and the actions of the protagonist. Bakhtin views this control as an ethical act, where the author’s decisions in shaping the hero’s fate are not just artistic choices but also moral ones. The way an author constructs a character’s world, choices, and destiny reflects broader concerns about agency, power, and moral values within the narrative.
