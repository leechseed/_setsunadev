### Title: **Tomashevsky's Defamiliarization Model**

- **Defamiliarization (Ostranenie)**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky expanded on the concept of defamiliarization, originally introduced by Viktor Shklovsky, which involves presenting common objects, events, or experiences in a way that makes them appear unfamiliar or strange. This technique is designed to disrupt the reader's automatic perception, forcing them to engage more deeply with the text and to see the world in a new light.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **Narrative and Thematic Defamiliarization**

- **Definition**:
  - Narrative and thematic defamiliarization refers to the use of unconventional narrative structures or unexpected thematic elements to challenge the reader’s usual way of understanding stories and their underlying messages. By subverting familiar narrative conventions or altering expected thematic patterns, authors can disrupt the reader's preconceived notions and stimulate critical thinking.

- **Contextualization**:
  - Defamiliarization is a critical tool in literary theory and practice for making the ordinary extraordinary. Tomashevsky’s exploration of this concept highlights its potential to refresh the reader’s experience of literature. By presenting familiar elements in unfamiliar ways, defamiliarization encourages readers to reconsider their perceptions and assumptions, deepening their engagement with the text. This technique is particularly effective in modernist and avant-garde literature, where breaking away from traditional forms and themes is essential to the artistic process.

- **Supporting Information**:
  - **Narrative Structure**:
    - **Definition**: Defamiliarization can be achieved through the manipulation of narrative structure, such as by altering the chronological order of events, using non-linear storytelling, or incorporating unexpected shifts in perspective.
    - **Contextualization**: These structural changes force readers to actively engage with the text to piece together the narrative, thereby renewing their attention and fostering a more profound interaction with the story.
    - **Examples**: In *Mrs. Dalloway* by Virginia Woolf, the stream-of-consciousness technique defamiliarizes the narrative by immersing the reader in the characters’ inner thoughts, making the flow of time and perception subjective and fragmented.

  - **Thematic Subversion**:
    - **Definition**: Thematic defamiliarization occurs when a narrative presents familiar themes in ways that are surprising or unconventional, leading readers to question their preconceived ideas about those themes.
    - **Contextualization**: By altering or subverting traditional themes, authors can challenge societal norms and encourage readers to think critically about commonly accepted beliefs or values.
    - **Examples**: Franz Kafka’s *The Metamorphosis* subverts the theme of alienation by literalizing it—transforming the protagonist into an insect—thus defamiliarizing the concept of human isolation and estrangement.

  - **Language and Style**:
    - **Definition**: Defamiliarization can also be achieved through the use of unusual or poetic language that disrupts ordinary modes of expression. This can involve the use of metaphor, unexpected diction, or unconventional syntax.
    - **Contextualization**: When the language itself is defamiliarized, it forces the reader to slow down and reconsider the meaning behind the words, enhancing their awareness of the text’s artistic qualities and underlying messages.
    - **Examples**: In James Joyce’s *Ulysses*, the use of fragmented and stream-of-consciousness prose defamiliarizes the act of reading itself, transforming it into an active, interpretive process.

  - **Perception and Reality**:
    - **Definition**: Defamiliarization often blurs the lines between perception and reality, presenting the world in a way that challenges the reader’s understanding of what is real and what is imagined.
    - **Contextualization**: By destabilizing the reader’s sense of reality, defamiliarization can create a sense of wonder, confusion, or introspection, leading to a more immersive and reflective reading experience.
    - **Examples**: In *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland* by Lewis Carroll, the defamiliarization of logic and language creates a dreamlike world that forces the reader to question the nature of reality and perception.

### **Implications of Tomashevsky’s Defamiliarization Model**

- Tomashevsky’s extension of defamiliarization into narrative and thematic elements provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how literature can challenge and transform the reader's perceptions. By making the familiar strange, defamiliarization not only revitalizes the reader’s experience of the text but also encourages deeper engagement with its themes and structures. This approach has had a significant impact on modern and postmodern literary practices, where the subversion of traditional forms and expectations is often central to the artistic intent. Through defamiliarization, literature becomes a space for innovation and critical reflection, pushing the boundaries of how stories are told and understood.
