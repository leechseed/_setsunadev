##### Key Concepts

##### Temporal Techniques

**Definition**:
   Temporal techniques refer to methods used to manipulate the sequence of events within a narrative, including flashbacks, flashforwards, ellipses, and summaries, which affect pacing and narrative progression.

**Types**:
   - **Flashbacks (Analepsis)**: Revisits past events to provide background information or context.
   - **Flashforwards (Prolepsis)**: Anticipates future events, creating suspense or foreshadowing outcomes.
   - **Ellipsis**: Skips over periods of time, speeding up the narrative’s pace.
   - **Summary**: Condenses long periods of time into brief narration to quickly advance the story.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Pacing Control**: Temporal techniques adjust the speed at which a story unfolds.
   - **Suspense Creation**: Techniques like flashforwards create anticipation by revealing future events.
   - **Informational Flow**: The arrangement of time affects how and when key information is revealed.

**Contextualization**:
   Temporal techniques are critical in shaping how audiences engage with a narrative. By manipulating time, storytellers can control pacing, build suspense, and emphasize important moments. Chatman’s analysis shows how these techniques guide the audience’s understanding of the story’s structure and meaning.

**Examples**:
   - **Christopher Nolan’s *Inception***: Uses flashbacks to reveal the protagonist’s past, deepening emotional stakes.
   - **Virginia Woolf’s *Mrs. Dalloway***: Employs ellipsis to move through different periods of the characters’ lives, focusing on significant moments.

##### Spatial Techniques

**Definition**:
   Spatial techniques involve the organization and depiction of space within a narrative, influencing how the audience perceives the setting, movement, and relationships between characters and their environment.

**Types**:
   - **Setting Description**: Detailed descriptions of the setting create a vivid sense of place.
   - **Scene Organization**: The arrangement of scenes within the narrative space affects pacing and emotional intensity.
   - **Visual Composition (in film)**: In cinematic narratives, camera angles, framing, and movement shape how space is perceived.

**Characteristics**:
   - **Atmosphere Creation**: Detailed spatial descriptions evoke emotional or thematic tones.
   - **Focus Guidance**: Spatial techniques guide the audience’s attention to specific areas or elements.
   - **Mood Setting**: The use of space can reflect character states or thematic undercurrents.

**Contextualization**:
   Spatial techniques immerse the audience in the narrative world and shape their emotional experience. In literature, settings transport readers to different times and places, while in film, visual composition influences how space is interpreted. Chatman emphasizes that space is as crucial as time in constructing the narrative’s reality.

**Examples**:
   - **F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby***: Uses the settings of East Egg, West Egg, and the Valley of Ashes to reflect social divisions and moral decay.
   - **Alfred Hitchcock’s *Rear Window***: The confined space of the protagonist’s apartment heightens the tension and suspense as the protagonist observes the mystery unfolding outside.
