### Title: **Forster's Prophecy Concept**

- **Prophecy**:
  - **Definition**: One of E.M. Forster’s more abstract concepts in literary criticism is *prophecy*, which he uses to describe the deeper, often spiritual or philosophical dimension of certain novels. Prophetic novels are those that engage with universal truths and existential questions, going beyond the surface-level narrative to explore profound aspects of the human experience.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **Deeper Meaning**

- **Definition**:
  - Prophetic novels are characterized by their exploration of universal truths or deep philosophical questions about human existence. Unlike works that focus solely on plot or character development, prophetic novels aim to uncover and express fundamental insights into life, often grappling with themes like morality, the nature of existence, or the human spirit.

- **Components of Deeper Meaning**:
  - **Transcendence of Storytelling**:
    - **Definition**: Prophetic novels transcend the limitations of conventional storytelling by infusing the narrative with layers of meaning that speak to the universal human condition. These novels often seek to address profound, timeless questions rather than merely entertain.
    - **Contextualization**: Forster suggests that this transcendence is what elevates a novel from being just a story to being a piece of art that resonates across time and culture. The prophetic quality of a novel can provide readers with a sense of connection to something greater than the individual narrative, offering a window into the deeper mysteries of life.
    - **Examples**: In *Moby-Dick* by Herman Melville, the novel’s exploration of obsession, fate, and the unknowable nature of the universe exemplifies Forster’s concept of prophecy. The narrative goes beyond the story of Captain Ahab’s pursuit of the white whale to delve into existential questions about humanity’s place in the cosmos.

  - **Universal Truths**:
    - **Definition**: These are the fundamental insights or principles that prophetic novels attempt to convey. They often address the core aspects of human nature, morality, and the human condition, posing questions that are as relevant today as they were in the past.
    - **Contextualization**: Forster’s idea of prophecy emphasizes that these truths are not tied to the specific details of the narrative but rather are expressed through the overarching themes and philosophical inquiries of the novel. These truths invite readers to reflect on their own lives and the world around them.
    - **Examples**: In *The Brothers Karamazov* by Fyodor Dostoevsky, the novel’s exploration of faith, doubt, and free will touches on universal truths that have continued to engage readers and scholars alike. The prophetic nature of the novel lies in its ability to confront deep moral and philosophical questions that transcend its 19th-century Russian setting.

  - **Philosophical Inquiry**:
    - **Definition**: Prophetic novels often serve as a medium for philosophical inquiry, using the narrative to explore and question the nature of reality, existence, and the human soul. These inquiries are integral to the novel’s structure, shaping the characters’ journeys and the plot’s development.
    - **Contextualization**: Forster highlights that the philosophical dimension of prophetic novels is what distinguishes them from other types of literature. This inquiry is not just an added element but is central to the narrative’s purpose, driving the story forward and providing depth to the characters’ experiences.
    - **Examples**: In *1984* by George Orwell, the novel’s exploration of totalitarianism, freedom, and the nature of truth serves as a philosophical inquiry into the dangers of absolute power and the fragility of individual autonomy. The prophetic quality of the novel lies in its ability to forecast the consequences of unchecked political control, resonating with readers across different historical contexts.

  - **Engagement with the Profound**:
    - **Definition**: Forster’s concept of prophecy involves an engagement with the profound aspects of life—those questions and ideas that challenge the reader to think deeply about the meaning and purpose of existence. This engagement often requires the reader to look beyond the literal events of the story to understand the symbolic and thematic significance.
    - **Contextualization**: The engagement with profound questions is what makes prophetic novels enduringly powerful. Forster believes that these works challenge readers to confront the essential mysteries of life, often leaving them with more questions than answers but with a deeper understanding of the human experience.
    - **Examples**: In *Beloved* by Toni Morrison, the novel’s engagement with themes of memory, trauma, and redemption reflects its prophetic nature. The story goes beyond the historical events of slavery to explore the profound psychological and spiritual impact of such experiences on individuals and communities, challenging readers to grapple with these difficult truths.

### **Forster’s Perspective on Prophetic Literature**

- **Literature as a Medium for Truth**:
  - **Definition**: Forster sees prophetic literature as a means of conveying truths that are not easily articulated in other forms. These novels are not merely telling a story but are using the narrative as a vehicle to express deeper philosophical or spiritual insights.
  - **Contextualization**: Forster’s focus on prophecy in literature underscores his belief in the power of fiction to engage with the most profound aspects of human existence. He argues that prophetic novels offer more than entertainment; they provide a space for readers to explore and reflect on the deeper truths of life.
  - **Examples**: In *To the Lighthouse* by Virginia Woolf, the novel’s stream-of-consciousness technique and focus on the inner lives of its characters allow it to explore themes of time, memory, and the search for meaning, embodying Forster’s concept of prophecy in its engagement with the intangible and the profound.
