### 1. **Forster's Prophecy Concept**

#### 1.1. **Prophecy**
- **Definition**: The term prophecy, in its general and original context, refers to the act of foretelling or predicting future events, often through divine inspiration or supernatural insight. Traditionally associated with religious and spiritual contexts, prophecy is believed to come from a higher power, where a prophet acts as a messenger or intermediary, revealing insights about future occurrences or guiding people based on divine will.

#### 1.2. **Forester's Prophecy**
- **Definition**: In E.M. Forster's concept, prophecy refers to a deeper, more abstract dimension in literature where a novel transcends its surface narrative to engage with universal truths, existential questions, and profound aspects of human life. Prophetic novels go beyond mere storytelling to explore deeper spiritual or philosophical insights, often addressing fundamental concerns about morality, existence, and the human condition. Forster's idea of prophecy involves a narrative that reaches for something greater than its plot or characters, touching on timeless, universal themes that resonate with readers on a deeper level.
