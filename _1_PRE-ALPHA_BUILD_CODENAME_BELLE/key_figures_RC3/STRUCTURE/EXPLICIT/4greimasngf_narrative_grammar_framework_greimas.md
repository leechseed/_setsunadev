### 1. **Greimas's Narrative Grammar Framework**

- **Narrative Grammar**:
  - **Definition**: Algirdas Julien Greimas extends structural semantics to include the concept of _narrative grammar_. He proposes that narratives, like sentences, possess an underlying grammatical structure that dictates how stories are constructed and understood. This structure serves as the foundation for the organization and progression of narratives, governed by rules similar to the grammatical rules of language. Greimas’s framework seeks to uncover the fundamental components and rules that drive a story’s flow, offering a systematic approach to narrative analysis.

  - **Predictable**: The story follows an expected trajectory, guiding the reader through a natural sequence of events.

###### 2.1.1.2. **Dynamic**

- **Definition**: Involves significant changes, developments, or shifts in the story, creating a sense of movement and evolution as the narrative progresses.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Unpredictable**: The narrative can shift in unexpected ways, keeping the reader engaged and uncertain about the outcome.
  - **Transformative**: Key elements of the story, such as characters, settings, or themes, undergo significant changes over time.
  - **Energetic**: A dynamic story is full of action, movement, and development, often with increasing intensity.

###### 2.1.1.3. **Character Evolution**

- **Definition**: A process in which a character undergoes profound changes in their identity, motivations, beliefs, or values as they face challenges and grow throughout the narrative.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Internal Growth**: The character develops emotionally, mentally, or spiritually as the story progresses.
  - **Dynamic Change**: Character evolution is often the result of key challenges or turning points that push the character to grow.
  - **Resolution of Inner Conflict**: By the end of the story, the character may reconcile opposing elements of their identity or beliefs.

###### 2.1.1.4. **Plot Resolution**

- **Definition**: The process of resolving or complicating the central conflicts of the narrative, bringing the story to a satisfying or thought-provoking conclusion.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Definitive**: Provides clear closure to the primary conflict or story arc.
  - **Ambiguous**: Some narratives leave the resolution open-ended, inviting interpretation from the audience.
  - **Satisfying**: The resolution ties up loose ends, providing closure to the narrative and answering the central questions or conflicts in a way that satisfies the reader.
  - **Complicating**: The resolution introduces new questions or adds complexity, complicating the narrative’s conclusion and leaving the reader with deeper reflections or open-ended possibilities.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Seamless**: Ensures the story moves naturally without abrupt shifts or breaks in continuity.
  - **Coherent**: Maintains logical progression, connecting events in a way that feels consistent and understandable.
  - **Thematic Unity**: Links different narrative elements, such as themes or motifs, that recur throughout the story.

---

###### 2.2.1.4. **Pivotal**

- **Definition**: Critical moments or events in the narrative that play a decisive role in determining the direction or outcome of the story.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Decisive**: These events or moments dramatically change the course of the narrative.
  - **High Stakes**: The outcomes of pivotal moments often have significant consequences for the characters or the plot.
  - **Emotionally Charged**: Pivotal events frequently involve heightened emotional tension, making them impactful for both the characters and the audience.
  - **Direction-Shifting**: Alters the narrative's course, steering it toward resolution or deeper complexity.

---

#### 2.3. **Narrative States**

- **Definition**:
  - Narrative states are the distinct conditions or moments within the story that are connected by transformations and transitions. Each state represents a specific phase in the story’s development.

##### 2.3.1. **Components of Narrative States**

###### 2.3.1.1. **Defined**

- **Definition**: Represents a distinct and clear stage in the progression of the narrative, marking key phases where the story takes a specific direction.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Distinct Stages**: The narrative is broken into clear phases or points, each with its own role in advancing the story.
  - **Progressive**: As the story moves forward, these defined stages build upon each other, creating a structured progression.
  - **Focused**: Each defined stage has a specific purpose within the overall plot, contributing to character development or thematic exploration.

###### 2.3.1.2. **Stable**

- **Definition**: Represents a state of internal consistency within the narrative, where characters, settings, and conflicts remain constant until disrupted by a transformative event or action.
