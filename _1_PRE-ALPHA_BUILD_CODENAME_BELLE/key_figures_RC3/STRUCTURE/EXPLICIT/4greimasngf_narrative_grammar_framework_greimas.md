### 1. **Greimas's Narrative Grammar Framework**

- **Narrative Grammar**:
  - **Definition**: Algirdas Julien Greimas extends structural semantics to include the concept of *narrative grammar*. He proposes that narratives, like sentences, possess an underlying grammatical structure that dictates how stories are constructed and understood. This structure serves as the foundation for the organization and progression of narratives, governed by rules similar to the grammatical rules of language. Greimas’s framework seeks to uncover the fundamental components and rules that drive a story’s flow, offering a systematic approach to narrative analysis.

---

### 2. **Key Concepts**

#### 2.1. **Transformations**

- **Definition**:
  - Transformations refer to the process by which a narrative moves from one state or situation to another. These changes often involve shifts in character roles, plot direction, or the resolution of conflicts.

- **Examples**:
  - In *A Christmas Carol* by Charles Dickens, Scrooge's transformation from greed to generosity is a key narrative shift.

##### 2.1.1. **Components of Transformations**

###### 2.1.1.1. **Sequential**

- **Definition**: Follows a logical and chronological progression, ensuring that events unfold in an orderly manner, guiding the reader through the narrative’s stages step by step.
  
- **Examples**:
  - **Linear Narratives**: Stories that follow a straightforward, time-ordered structure, where one event naturally leads to the next.
  - **Cause and Effect**: Each action or decision in the story leads to consequences that shape future events, ensuring a clear, sequential flow.
  - **Step-by-Step Development**: Narratives that focus on a journey, quest, or process where each phase builds upon the previous one, such as in *The Odyssey*.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Chronological**: The events occur in the order they happen in time, without jumping back or forward.
  - **Logical Flow**: Each event is connected logically to the next, creating a coherent progression.
  - **Predictable**: The story follows an expected trajectory, guiding the reader through a natural sequence of events.


###### 2.1.1.2. **Dynamic**

- **Definition**: Involves significant changes, developments, or shifts in the story, creating a sense of movement and evolution as the narrative progresses.
  
- **Examples**:
  - **Plot Twists**: Sudden changes in the narrative that alter the course of the story, such as revelations or unexpected events.
