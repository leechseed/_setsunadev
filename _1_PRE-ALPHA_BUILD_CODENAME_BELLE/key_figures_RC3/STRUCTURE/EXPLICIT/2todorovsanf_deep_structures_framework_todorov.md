### 7. **Theoretical Significance**

- **Todorov's Contribution to Structural Analysis**:
  - Todorov's structural analysis of narrative provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the essential components of storytelling. By breaking down narratives into their fundamental elements and exploring their deep structures, Todorov offers a method for systematically analyzing how stories are built and how they function to produce meaning.
  - **Application in Literary Studies**: This framework is particularly valuable in literary studies for dissecting the architecture of narratives and for exploring how different structural elements contribute to the overall impact of a story. It allows scholars to approach narratives with a focus on the underlying rules and patterns that govern their construction.
  - **Continued Relevance**: Todorov’s deep structures framework remains influential in contemporary narrative analysis, offering tools to explore not just the content of stories but the formal structures that give them shape. His work continues to inform critical approaches to literature, enabling a deeper understanding of the universal principles underlying narrative forms.
