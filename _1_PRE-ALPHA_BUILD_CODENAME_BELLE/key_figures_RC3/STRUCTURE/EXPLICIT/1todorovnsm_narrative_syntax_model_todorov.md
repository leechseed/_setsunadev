### 1. **Todorov's Narrative Syntax Model**

- **Narrative Syntax**:
  - **Definition**: Tzvetan Todorov posits that narratives can be analyzed through a syntax-like structure, analogous to how sentences are constructed in language. This approach views narratives as having a formal structure that can be broken down into key elements, each contributing to the overall progression of the story. Todorov's model identifies a pattern of equilibrium, disequilibrium, and restoration of equilibrium as the foundational structure of many narratives.
