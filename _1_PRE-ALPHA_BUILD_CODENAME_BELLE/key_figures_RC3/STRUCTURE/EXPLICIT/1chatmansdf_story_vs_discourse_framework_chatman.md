### 0.1. **Chatman's Story vs. Discourse Framework**

- **Author**: Seymour Chatman
- **Title**: Chatman's Story vs. Discourse Framework

### 0.2. **Story vs. Discourse**

### 0.3. **Key Concepts**

#### 0.3.1. **Story**

- **Definition**:
  - The _story_ refers to the content or the _what_ of the narrative. It includes the events, characters, settings, and actions that form the basic structure of the narrative. The story is the raw material, existing independently of how it is presented to the audience.

##### 0.3.1.1. **Components of Story**:

- **Events**:
  - **Definition**: Incidents or occurrences that move the plot forward and form the backbone of the narrative.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - **Pivotal**: Drive the central plot forward.
    - **Sequential**: Follow a logical or thematic order to maintain coherence.

###### 0.3.1.1.1. **Characters**:

- **Definition**: Individuals or entities that participate in the narrative events.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Complex**: Contain depth, showing growth or change over time.
  - **Relatable**: Often designed to evoke emotional connection or sympathy from the audience.

###### 0.3.1.1.2. **Settings**:

- **Definition**: The time and place where the narrative events occur.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Grounded**: Provides a believable and immersive context for the story.
  - **Descriptive**: Richly detailed to enhance the world-building.

###### 0.3.1.1.3. **Actions**:

- **Definition**: Behaviors, decisions, or deeds performed by the characters that affect the narrative’s direction.
- **Characteristics**:

  - **Purposeful**: Drive the plot through intentional decisions or reactions.
  - **Consequential**: Lead to important developments or shifts in the story's trajectory.

- **Contextualization**:
  - The _story_ forms the foundation of any narrative. It provides the building blocks of the plot, character arcs, and thematic developments, regardless of the medium through which it is presented. For instance, the story of _Cinderella_ remains consistent across different adaptations, such as books, films, and plays, though the _discourse_ or the presentation can vary.

#### 1.0.1. **Discourse**

- **Definition**:
  - _Discourse_ refers to the _how_ of the narrative, encompassing the methods and techniques used to present the story. It includes narrative structure, voice, perspective, style, and the medium through which the narrative is conveyed.

##### 1.0.1.1. **Components of Discourse**:

###### 1.0.1.1.1. **Focalization**:

- **Definition**: The perspective or point of view from which the narrative is told, determining what the audience sees and knows.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Focused**: Provides insight into the subjective experiences of characters.
  - **Selective**: Chooses what details or events to emphasize, shaping the narrative’s angle.

###### 1.0.1.1.2. **Order of Events**:

- **Definition**: The sequence in which the story’s events are presented, whether chronological, non-linear, or through flashbacks.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Structured**: Follows a deliberate pattern to control the flow of information.
  - **Manipulative**: Alters time and sequence to create tension or reveal key details strategically.

###### 1.0.1.1.3. **Narrative Voice**:

- **Definition**: The entity or narrator that tells the story, shaping how the audience perceives the events.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Distinctive**: Unique to each story, offering a particular tone or attitude.
  - **Guiding**: Directs how the audience interprets the events and emotions within the story.

###### 1.0.1.1.4. **Style**:

- **Definition**: The author’s choice of language, tone, and literary devices that contribute to the unique voice of the narrative.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Expressive**: Utilizes a distinct linguistic style to evoke emotions and thoughts.
  - **Evocative**: Uses literary tools like metaphor, symbolism, and irony to add depth.

###### 1.0.1.1.5. **Medium**:

- **Definition**: The form or platform through which the story is conveyed, such as text, film, or visual art.
- **Characteristics**:

  - **Adaptable**: Adjusts the narrative techniques to suit the medium.
  - **Interactive**: Engages the audience through visual, auditory, or textual elements, depending on the medium.

- **Contextualization**:
  - Discourse influences how the audience interacts with the story, guiding their emotional response and intellectual interpretation. It shapes the delivery of the narrative through techniques like non-linear timelines, shifting perspectives, or the use of symbolism and metaphor. By manipulating discourse, storytellers can create tension, surprise, or multiple layers of meaning.

### 1.1. **Importance of the Distinction**

- **Narrative Analysis**:
  - **Definition**: The separation of story and discourse is essential for narrative analysis, as it allows critics to dissect how content (story) is shaped by presentation (discourse).

    - **Detailed**: Focuses on how specific choices in discourse affect the audience's perception.

  - **Definition**: When adapting a narrative from one medium to another (e.g., from novel to film), the story may remain unchanged while the discourse undergoes significant transformation.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - **Transformative**: Alters the experience by introducing new narrative techniques.
    - **Evolving**: Adapts narrative style to fit the strengths of each medium.
- **Broader Implications**:
  - **Definition**: The story vs. discourse distinction has broad applicability across multiple narrative forms, from traditional literature to modern media such as video games and digital storytelling.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - **Versatile**: Applies to any narrative medium, from written to visual storytelling.
    - **Universal**: Reveals the common underlying structures of diverse narratives.
