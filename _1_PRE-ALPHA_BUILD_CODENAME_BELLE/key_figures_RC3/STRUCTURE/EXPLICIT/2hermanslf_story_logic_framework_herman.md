### 1. **Herman's Story Logic Framework**

- **Story Logic**:
  - **Definition**: The concept of *story logic* refers to the underlying principles that govern the organization and coherence of narratives. David Herman examines how stories are structured to create logical connections between events, characters, and settings, facilitating the narrative's intelligibility and impact.

---

### 2. **Key Concepts**

#### 2.1. **Narrative Coherence**
#### 2.2. **Narrative Sense-Making**

---

### 3. **Narrative Coherence**

- **Definition**: 
  - Story logic involves understanding how different elements of a narrative fit together to form a coherent whole. This includes recognizing causal relationships, thematic connections, and the narrative's overall structure.

![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_narrative_coherence_start.jpg "narrative coherence")

#### 3.1. **Components of Narrative Coherence**

##### 3.1.1. **Causal Relationships**

- **Definition**: 
  - The logical connections between events in a story, where one event leads to another, creating a cause-and-effect sequence that drives the narrative forward.

![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_causal_relationships.jpg "causal relationships")

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Sequential**: Events occur in a logical sequence.
  - **Interconnected**: One event leads to another.
  - **Necessary**: Causality is essential for narrative coherence.

- **Examples**: 
  - In *Oedipus Rex* by Sophocles, the discovery of Oedipus's true identity leads to his downfall, with each event logically following from the previous one.

---

##### 3.1.2. **Thematic Connections**

- **Definition**: 
  - The recurring ideas or motifs that link different parts of the narrative, providing a sense of unity and reinforcing the story's central themes.

![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_thematic_connections.jpg "thematic connections")

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Unifying**: Themes serve as central threads connecting different parts of the narrative.
  - **Recurring**: Key ideas or motifs appear throughout the story.
  - **Reinforcing**: Themes strengthen the narrative’s core message or emotional impact.

- **Examples**: 
  - In *Moby-Dick* by Herman Melville, the theme of obsession links Ahab's pursuit of the whale with the crew's involvement in the quest.

---

##### 3.1.3. **Narrative Structure**

- **Definition**: 
  - The overall organization of a narrative, including its plot, pacing, and the arrangement of events.

![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_narrative_structure.jpg "narrative structure")

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Organized**: Events are structured in a clear, deliberate sequence.
  - **Paced**: The narrative’s rhythm keeps the story engaging.
  - **Integrated**: Every part contributes to the whole.

- **Examples**: 
  - In *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen, the novel's structured development ensures the coherence of character growth and plot progression.

---

##### 3.1.4. **Character Consistency**

- **Definition**: 
  - The logical development of characters' actions, decisions, and behaviors throughout the narrative, ensuring they act in ways that align with their established personalities and motivations.

![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_character_consistency.jpg "character consistency")

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Stable**: Characters’ traits remain consistent.
  - **Logical**: Actions reflect established motivations.
  - **Predictable**: Behavior aligns with their personality, aiding comprehension.

- **Examples**: 
  - In *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gatsby's relentless pursuit of Daisy aligns with his consistent character traits of idealism and determination.

---

##### 3.1.5. **Temporal Coherence**

- **Definition**: 
  - Temporal coherence refers to the logical progression of time within a narrative, ensuring that the sequence of events and their placement in the timeline are clear and consistent.


![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_temporal_coherence.jpg "temporal coherence")

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Chronological**: Time progresses logically from past to present.
  - **Consistent**: Temporal shifts, like flashbacks, are clear and understandable.
  - **Coherent**: The timeline aligns with narrative flow.

- **Examples**: 
  - In *Cloud Atlas* by David Mitchell, despite the narrative's shifts across different time periods, temporal coherence is maintained through clear transitions and thematic links.

---

##### 3.1.6. **Spatial Coherence**

- **Definition**: 
  - Spatial coherence refers to the logical consistency of space within the narrative, ensuring that the story’s setting is clearly defined and the characters’ movements and interactions within the space make sense.


![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_spatial_coherence.jpg "spatial coherence")

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Defined**: Settings are clearly described and maintained.
  - **Consistent**: Characters’ movements are logical within the space.
  - **Realistic**: Spatial relationships between elements make sense.

- **Examples**: 
  - In *The Lord of the Rings* by J.R.R. Tolkien, the consistent mapping of Middle-earth ensures that spatial coherence is maintained throughout the characters' journeys.

### 4. **Narrative Sense-Making**
- **Definition**: 
  - Story logic is not only about the narrative's formal elements but also about how readers use cognitive strategies to make sense of these elements. This involves interpreting the story's coherence, anticipating outcomes, and filling in gaps.

![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_narrative_sense-making_start.jpg "narrative sense-making start")


#### 4.1. **Components of Narrative Sense-making**

##### 4.1.1. **Inference-Making**

- **Definition**: 
  - The reader’s ability to draw conclusions about the narrative based on the information provided, even when some details are not explicitly stated.

![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_inference-making.jpg "inference-making")

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Logical**: Readers infer connections between events.
  - **Active**: Engagement through interpretation of implied details.
  - **Necessary**: Gaps in the narrative encourage inferential thinking.

- **Examples**: 
  - In *Sherlock Holmes* stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, readers are encouraged to make inferences about the mystery alongside Holmes, piecing together clues.

---

##### 4.1.2. **Pattern Recognition**

- **Definition**: 
  - The process of identifying recurring patterns, themes, or structures within a narrative that contribute to its overall coherence.

![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_pattern_recognition.jpg "pattern recognition")

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Familiar**: Patterns aid understanding by creating predictability.
  - **Repetitive**: Recurring motifs solidify themes.
  - **Guiding**: Patterns provide a roadmap for narrative flow.

- **Examples**: 
  - In *The Odyssey* by Homer, the recurring theme of the hero's journey and the trials Odysseus faces form a recognizable pattern.

---

##### 4.1.3. **Expectation**

- **Definition**: 
  - Expectation is the cognitive strategy where readers form predictions about future events based on the narrative’s established logic, patterns, and foreshadowing.

![herman_photo](../../../assets/2HermanSLF_expectation.jpg "expectation")
