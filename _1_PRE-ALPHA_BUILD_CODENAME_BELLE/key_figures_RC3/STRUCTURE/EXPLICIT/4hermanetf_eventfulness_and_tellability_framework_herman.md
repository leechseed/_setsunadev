### 1. Title: **Herman's Eventfulness and Tellability Framework**

- **Eventfulness and Tellability**:
  - **Definition**: In *"Story Logic,"* David Herman introduces the concepts of *eventfulness* and *tellability,* central to understanding why certain narratives capture an audience's interest. *Eventfulness* refers to the significance and impact of events within a story—those moments that alter the narrative's course. *Tellability* concerns the qualities that make a story engaging, thought-provoking, or worth sharing with others.
