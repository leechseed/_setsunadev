### Title: **Tomashevsky's Reader Interaction Model**

- **The Role of the Reader**:
  - **Definition**: Boris Tomashevsky delves into how the arrangement of themes, motifs, and the overall structure of the *syuzhet* (plot) influences the reader’s interpretation and engagement with the narrative. He argues that the *syuzhet* is meticulously constructed to guide the reader’s attention, evoke specific emotional responses, and create effects such as suspense, surprise, or deeper emotional engagement with the story.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **Guided Interpretation**

- **Definition**:
  - Guided interpretation refers to the deliberate structuring of the *syuzhet* in a way that directs the reader’s focus and shapes their understanding of the narrative. By controlling the flow of information, the author can influence how the reader perceives characters, events, and themes, leading them to certain conclusions or emotional responses at particular points in the story.

- **Contextualization**:
  - Tomashevsky’s model emphasizes that the reader is not merely a passive observer but an active participant in the narrative process. The *syuzhet* strategically provides and withholds information, prompting the reader to make inferences, anticipate outcomes, or reassess their understanding of the narrative as it unfolds. This interactive process enhances the reader’s engagement with the story, making the narrative experience more dynamic and immersive.

- **Supporting Information**:
  - **Narrative Devices**: The *syuzhet* often employs devices such as foreshadowing, red herrings, and dramatic irony to guide the reader’s interpretation. For example, foreshadowing can lead the reader to anticipate a certain event, while a red herring might mislead them, creating a surprise when the true nature of the event is revealed.
  - **Reader Expectations**: The construction of the *syuzhet* plays with reader expectations by fulfilling or subverting them. This manipulation of expectations can result in heightened suspense, emotional impact, or a deeper thematic understanding.
  - **Examples**: In *Murder on the Orient Express* by Agatha Christie, the *syuzhet* guides the reader through a complex web of clues, misdirections, and character interactions, leading to a surprising and satisfying resolution. The narrative carefully controls the release of information to maintain suspense and keep the reader engaged in solving the mystery.
