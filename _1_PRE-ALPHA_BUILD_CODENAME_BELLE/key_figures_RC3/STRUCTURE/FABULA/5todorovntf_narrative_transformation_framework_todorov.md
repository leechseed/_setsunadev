### 2. **Key Concepts**

#### 2.1. **In-Text Transformation**

- **Definition**:
  - In-text transformation refers to the evolution of a narrative’s structure, tone, or focus as the story progresses within a single text. This shift can alter the reader’s experience by introducing unexpected changes in genre, tone, or perspective.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Genre Shifts**: The narrative can begin in one genre and shift to another, adding depth and complexity to the story.
  - **Tone Changes**: The tone may evolve, moving from light-hearted to dark, ironic to serious, reflecting deeper emotional or thematic changes.
  - **Narrative Focus**: The story may shift focus between characters, themes, or events, expanding the narrative’s scope.

- **Contextualization**:
  - In-text transformation is essential for understanding narratives that defy conventional boundaries. It reveals how stories can continuously adapt as they unfold, offering new layers of meaning and challenging readers’ expectations.

- **Supporting Information**:
  - **Examples**: In *Wuthering Heights* by Emily Brontë, the story begins as a Gothic romance but transforms into a dark tale of revenge, with shifting narrative perspectives that reveal deeper character complexities and emotional tension.

#### 2.2. **Cross-Text Transformation**

- **Definition**:
  - Cross-text transformation refers to the evolution of narrative structures across different works within a genre. Over time, genres adapt, change, or even merge to reflect broader cultural, historical, and literary shifts.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Genre Evolution**: Genres undergo significant changes over time, influenced by societal values, technological advancements, and new artistic trends.
  - **Hybridization**: Genres can blend together, creating new narrative forms by combining elements from different traditions.
  - **Cultural Influence**: Genres evolve in response to changing cultural norms, reflecting contemporary issues and concerns.

- **Contextualization**:
  - Cross-text transformation highlights the fluid nature of genres, showing how they respond to external pressures and incorporate new ideas. This process ensures the ongoing relevance of genres in different eras.

- **Supporting Information**:
  - **Examples**: The evolution of the Western genre from early pulp novels to revisionist Westerns like *Unforgiven* demonstrates how cross-text transformation reflects changing attitudes toward morality, heroism, and violence in American culture.
