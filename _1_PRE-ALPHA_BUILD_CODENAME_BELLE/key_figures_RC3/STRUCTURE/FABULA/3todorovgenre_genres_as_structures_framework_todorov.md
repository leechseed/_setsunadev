### **Todorov's Genres as Structures Framework**

- **Genres as Structures**:
  - **Definition**: Tzvetan Todorov extends his structural analysis to the study of literary genres, proposing that genres should be viewed not as rigid, fixed categories, but as dynamic structures that evolve over time. Todorov argues that genres are shaped by their narrative forms, which in turn influence how readers interpret texts within those genres.
