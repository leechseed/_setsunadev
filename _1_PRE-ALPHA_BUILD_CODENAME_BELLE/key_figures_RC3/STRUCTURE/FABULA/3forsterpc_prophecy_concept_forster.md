### 4. **Deeper Meaning**
- **Definition**:  
  Prophetic novels are characterized by their exploration of universal truths or deep philosophical questions about human existence.

  - **Philosophical**: Focuses on deep, existential questions.

  - **Thematic**: Focuses on significant existential or moral issues.
