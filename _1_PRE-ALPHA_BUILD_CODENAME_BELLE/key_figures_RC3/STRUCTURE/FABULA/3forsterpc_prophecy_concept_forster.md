### **Key Concepts**

#### **Deeper Meaning**

- **Definition**:
  - Prophetic novels are characterized by their exploration of universal truths or deep philosophical questions about human existence. Unlike works that focus solely on plot or character development, prophetic novels aim to uncover and express fundamental insights into life, often grappling with themes like morality, the nature of existence, or the human spirit.

- **Components of Deeper Meaning**:
  - **Transcendence of Storytelling**:
    - **Definition**: Prophetic novels transcend the limitations of conventional storytelling by infusing the narrative with layers of meaning that speak to the universal human condition.
    - **Characteristics**:
      - **Layered**: The narrative contains multiple levels of meaning.
      - **Universal**: Engages with timeless, cross-cultural themes.
      - **Philosophical**: Focuses on deep, existential questions.
    - **Examples**: In *Moby-Dick* by Herman Melville, the novel’s exploration of obsession, fate, and the unknowable nature of the universe exemplifies Forster’s concept of prophecy.

  - **Universal Truths**:
    - **Definition**: These are the fundamental insights or principles that prophetic novels attempt to convey, addressing core aspects of human nature, morality, and the human condition.
    - **Characteristics**:
      - **Timeless**: The truths are applicable across time periods.
      - **Profound**: Deals with deep, philosophical concerns.
      - **Reflective**: Encourages readers to contemplate life’s meaning.
    - **Examples**: In *The Brothers Karamazov* by Fyodor Dostoevsky, the novel’s exploration of faith, doubt, and free will engages with universal truths that transcend its 19th-century Russian setting.

  - **Philosophical Inquiry**:
    - **Definition**: Prophetic novels often serve as a medium for philosophical inquiry, using the narrative to explore and question the nature of reality, existence, and the human soul.
    - **Characteristics**:
      - **Inquisitive**: The narrative poses existential questions.
      - **Reflective**: Encourages philosophical thought and debate.
      - **Introspective**: Examines inner human experiences and thoughts.
    - **Examples**: In *1984* by George Orwell, the novel’s exploration of totalitarianism, freedom, and truth serves as a philosophical inquiry into the dangers of absolute power.

  - **Engagement with the Profound**:
    - **Definition**: Forster’s concept of prophecy involves an engagement with profound aspects of life, requiring the reader to look beyond literal events to understand the symbolic and thematic significance.
    - **Characteristics**:
      - **Symbolic**: The narrative often works on metaphorical levels.
      - **Thematic**: Focuses on significant existential or moral issues.
      - **Intense**: Confronts the reader with difficult, unanswerable questions.
    - **Examples**: In *Beloved* by Toni Morrison, the novel’s engagement with themes of memory, trauma, and redemption goes beyond historical events to explore profound psychological and spiritual truths.
