### Title: **Bal's Temporal Structures Framework**

- **Temporal Structures**:
  - **Definition**: Mieke Bal’s analysis of temporal structures in narrative focuses on how time is manipulated within a story. She examines the concepts of *order*, *duration*, and *frequency*, providing a framework for understanding the temporal dynamics of narratives.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Order**:
      - **Definition**: Order refers to the arrangement of events in the narrative, which may differ from their chronological sequence. Bal explores how anachronies, such as flashbacks and flashforwards, influence the interpretation of the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: The manipulation of narrative order affects how the story is understood, particularly in how past and future events are revealed to the reader. Bal’s framework highlights the significance of these temporal shifts in shaping the reader’s experience and understanding of the narrative.
    - **Duration**:
      - **Definition**: Duration describes the relationship between the time of the events in the story and the time it takes to narrate them. This concept includes techniques like summary, scene, and ellipsis, which control the pacing of the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: Duration is a key factor in narrative pacing and focus. By analyzing how time is compressed or expanded, Bal’s framework helps to understand the narrative’s emphasis on certain events and the overall rhythm of the story.
    - **Frequency**:
      - **Definition**: Frequency refers to the number of times an event is narrated. Bal distinguishes between *singulative* (one event narrated once), *repeating* (one event narrated multiple times), and *iterative* (multiple events narrated once) narration.
      - **Contextualization**: The concept of frequency allows for the analysis of repetition and emphasis within a narrative. Bal’s framework provides insights into how the repetition of events or actions can affect the story’s thematic development and the reader’s perception of its significance.
