### Title: **Chatman's Character and Event Framework**

- **Character and Event**:
  - **Definition**: In *"Story and Discourse,"* Seymour Chatman provides a detailed analysis of characters and events as narrative components. He categorizes characters as either *kernel* or *satellite* characters and distinguishes between *kernels* (major plot events) and *satellites* (minor events).
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Kernel and Satellite Characters**:
      - **Definition**: Kernel characters are essential to the progression of the plot, while satellite characters serve supplementary roles that add depth to the narrative but are not critical to its forward movement.
      - **Contextualization**: This distinction helps in understanding the hierarchical structure of narrative roles and how different characters contribute to the overall development of the story.
    - **Kernel and Satellite Events**:
      - **Definition**: Kernels are major plot events that drive the narrative forward, whereas satellites are minor events that provide additional context or depth without altering the main plot trajectory.
      - **Contextualization**: Understanding the distinction between kernel and satellite events allows for a more nuanced analysis of how narratives are structured and how different events contribute to the pacing and development of the story.
