### Title: **Greimas's Actantial Model**

- **Actantial Model**:
  - **Definition**: Greimas proposes the *actantial model*, a framework for analyzing the roles and functions of characters in a narrative. The model identifies six actants (roles) that are essential to any narrative: Subject, Object, Sender, Receiver, Helper, and Opponent.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Subject and Object**:
      - **Definition**: The Subject is the main character or entity that seeks something, while the Object is the goal or desired entity that the Subject seeks.
      - **Contextualization**: This relationship forms the core of the narrative’s action, driving the plot forward as the Subject pursues the Object.
    - **Sender and Receiver**:
      - **Definition**: The Sender is the entity that motivates or initiates the Subject's quest, while the Receiver is the entity that benefits from the Subject's success.
      - **Contextualization**: These roles highlight the narrative’s purpose and the distribution of outcomes, providing insight into the narrative’s moral or thematic resolution.
    - **Helper and Opponent**:
      - **Definition**: The Helper assists the Subject in achieving their goal, while the Opponent obstructs the Subject’s efforts.
      - **Contextualization**: The dynamic between Helpers and Opponents adds complexity to the narrative, creating conflict and alliances that shape the story’s progression.
