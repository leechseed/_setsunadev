### Title: **Brooks's Narrative as a Rhetorical Structure Framework**

- **Narrative as a Rhetorical Structure**:
  - **Definition**: Peter Brooks views narrative as inherently rhetorical, designed to produce specific effects on the reader. He examines how narrative techniques, such as repetition, foreshadowing, and framing, guide the reader’s interpretation and emotional response.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Repetition and Foreshadowing**:
      - **Definition**: Repetition reinforces key themes or ideas within a narrative, while foreshadowing hints at future events, creating expectations in the reader’s mind.
      - **Contextualization**: These techniques are essential for directing the reader’s attention and shaping their understanding of the narrative’s trajectory, making the story more impactful and engaging.
    - **Framing**:
      - **Definition**: Framing involves how the narrative is presented, including the perspective from which it is told and the context provided for understanding the story.
      - **Contextualization**: By controlling how the narrative is framed, authors can influence how readers interpret the events and characters within the story, adding layers of meaning and emotional resonance.
