# INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT REPORT

## Division: NARRATIVE SYSTEMS DESIGN ‚Äî Character Intelligence Layer

## Project Lead: FLUBBERGLAM OPS

## Date: 2025-04-12

## Status: ACTIVE ‚Äî KNOWLEDGE BASE STABILIZATION PHASE

---

## üß† Summary

We have successfully extracted, structured, and formalized the character theory framework of **Robert McKee's _Character: The Art of Role and Cast Design_**. The material is now fully integrated into a modular, reference-ready format for system use in simulation engines, worldbuilding workflows, and IP design.

This lays the groundwork for _Character Intelligence Architecture Tier 1_, providing foundational schemas for personality logic, cast design, moral conflict, and narrative arcs in adaptive systems.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Conceptual Extraction**

- Identified all core concepts from each chapter of McKee‚Äôs book.
- Isolated primary educational value per chapter with subcomponent logic for fast parsing.

### 2. **Attribute Taxonomy Defined**

- Created a structured list of McKee-aligned character attributes.
- Attributes classified into six logical domains:
  - Core Psychological
  - Moral and Ethical
  - Behavioral and Social
  - Structural and Dramatic
  - Dimensional
  - Relational

### 3. **Knowledge Encoding**

- YAML frontmatter constructed for integration into markdown-based knowledge systems.
- Includes fields for UID, grade level, knowledge type, and prima-forma.

### 4. **Cognitive Visualization**

- Mermaid mindmap created to allow high-level abstraction and quick drill-down.
- Suitable for visual learners, executive review, and system modeling workflows.

## üî• Key Insight

McKee‚Äôs model provides the **deepest psychological logic** of any character theory parsed so far. It is especially potent in AI simulation and generative storytelling due to its recursive internal logic (desire ‚Üí contradiction ‚Üí gap ‚Üí change).

---

## üìé Strategic Note

This node is a keystone reference for the **FLUBBERGLAM UNICURSAL GUTS 99** framework. Future cross-compatibility expected with:

- Narrative Chemistry Engine (Character-Arc ‚Üî Plot Engine)
- Cast Simulation Webs (Graph-Based Role Design)
- Moral Alignment Systems (Ethical Dilemmas via Arc Conflict Mapping)

## üîö Final Word

This documentation is **stage-ready** for high-level design meetings, simulation planning, and integration into worldbuilding IP pipelines. Immediate next step is to **cross-index McKee attributes with Weiland, Edelstein, and Writer‚Äôs Digest archetype stacks** for total synthesis.

**Ready for command.**
