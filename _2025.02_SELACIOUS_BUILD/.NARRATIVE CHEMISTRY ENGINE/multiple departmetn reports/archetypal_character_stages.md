## üîç Executive Summary

This report outlines the progress made in mapping out **character archetypal life stages** into a structured data format. The goal is to develop a lifecycle-aware character development framework that merges mythological, psychological, and narrative models. This foundational taxonomy will be used for AI-driven character generation, narrative structuring, and interactive storytelling systems.

## ‚úÖ Objectives Completed

### 1. **Identified Eight Core Archetypal Life Stages**

- Birth / Origin
- Childhood / Early Innocence
- Initiation / Coming of Age
- Rebellion / Crisis of Identity
- Mastery / Power
- Sacrifice / Fall
- Death / Transformation
- Legacy / Return

Each stage mirrors timeless narrative and developmental arcs found in mythology, fiction, and psychology.

---

### 2. **Mapped Key Psychological and Narrative Attributes**

Each life stage includes a defined list of **5 narrative-relevant attributes**, representing:

- Psychological states
- Relational dynamics
- Role-based functionality
- Transformative potential
- Archetypal symbolism

---

### 3. **Exported Data in YAML Format**

- YAML structure is formatted for Obsidian integration, database imports, or direct use in documentation tools.
- Clean nesting and tagging for easy manipulation in future stages (e.g., integrating with character templates, simulators, or dialogue engines).
