# INTERNAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT REPORT

## Subject: Stanislavski-Based Character Metrics System

## Prepared by: Narrative Systems R&D — Performance Modeling Unit

## Date: 2025-04-12

## Executive Summary

This report outlines the development of a **quantitative character evaluation system** based on **Stanislavski’s System**, designed to standardize performance analysis through measurable metrics. It serves as a foundational model for actor training, performance diagnostics, and scalable character development pipelines.

---

## Completed Objectives

### ✅ **Attribute Identification**

- Extracted 16 core performance categories directly aligned with _An Actor Prepares_ and the broader Stanislavskian system.
- Ensured each attribute reflects a **key internal or external component** of character realism and believability.

### ✅ **Metric Conversion System**

- Created a **metrics framework** that breaks abstract performance traits into actionable scores and checklists.
- Each metric allows evaluation on:
  - **Clarity**
  - **Specificity**
  - **Behavioral variation**
  - **Presence/absence of key psychological dynamics**

| **Super-Objective**          | Clarity Scale (1–5)       | 1 = Vague or missing → 5 = Clearly defined and driving every choice                             |
| **Objectives**               | Specificity Scale (1–5)   | 1 = Vague/general (“be angry”) → 5 = Specific/actionable (“convince him to confess”)            |
| **Actions (Tactics)**        | Variety Count             | Count distinct, playable actions used in scene (goal: 3+ variations)                            |
| **Inner Motive Forces**      | Integration Score (1–5)   | 1 = Disconnected elements → 5 = Fully aligned mind, will, and emotion                           |
| **Adaptations**              | Flexibility Rating (1–5)  | 1 = Rigid/repetitive → 5 = Shifts tactics fluidly based on stimulus                             |
| **Subtext**                  | Presence Y/N              | [ ] Subtext present and active beneath spoken lines                                             |
| **Emotion Memory**           | Usage Scale (1–5)         | 1 = Never applied → 5 = Intentionally, strategically used and safely adapted                    |
| **Tempo-Rhythm**             | Alignment Rating (1–5)    | 1 = Disjointed tempo/emotion → 5 = Inner state aligned with pacing and energy                   |
| **Physical Score**           | Precision Checklist       | [ ] Motivated [ ] Rehearsed [ ] Repeatable [ ] Varied with dramatic intention                   |
| **Magic “If”**               | Engagement Scale (1–5)    | 1 = Emotion imposed unnaturally → 5 = Fully immersed through imagination                        |
| **Circles of Attention**     | Focus Score (1–5)         | 1 = Distracted/self-aware → 5 = Maintains layered, consistent attention                         |
| **Faith and Truth**          | Believability Score (1–5) | 1 = Forced/unreal → 5 = Convincing, rooted in believable emotional commitment                   |
| **Communion**                | Reactivity Score (1–5)    | 1 = Performs in isolation → 5 = Fully responsive to partners and environment                    |
| **Unbroken Line**            | Continuity Rating (1–5)   | 1 = Fragmented progression → 5 = Continuous logical/emotional arc across role                   |
| **Characterization Details** | Layer Count (Quantified)  | Count of unique, embodied layers (goal: 3–6) → voice, walk, posture, tic, habit, breath pattern |
