# 🧭 INTERNAL SYSTEMS REPORT: CHARACTER MOTIVATION FRAMEWORK — DAVID CORBETT MODEL

**Prepared For**: FLUBBERGLAM OPS – Narrative R&D Division  
**Date**: 2025-04-12  
**Prepared By**: Systems Lead, Narrative Architecture Unit  
**Subject**: Completion Status Report — _The Compass of Character_ Integration

---

## ✅ OBJECTIVE

Establish and operationalize David Corbett’s _The Compass of Character_ methodology into a modular, extensible format suitable for use in high-complexity IP creation pipelines. Key output: dynamic character architecture using YAML-based templates and interlinked narrative logic for simulation and prose systems.

## 📘 SOURCE MATERIAL SYNTHESIS

### Title:

**The Compass of Character: Creating Complex Motivation for Compelling Characters in Fiction, Film, and TV**  
**Author**: David Corbett

### Mission Summary:

- Fully deconstructed the book into **chapter-by-chapter key concepts** and **finite motivational structures**.
- Extracted and classified core psychological and emotional mechanics of character creation.
- Created a **unified framework of attributes** that define a compelling, complex character across moral and emotional dimensions.

---

## 🧩 COMPONENTS BUILT

### 1. **Attribute Classification**

Categorized all motivational components into distinct operational layers:

- **Desire** – conscious external goal.
- **Fear** – psychological/emotional inhibitor.
- **Wound** – backstory trauma shaping worldview.
- **Yearning** – unconscious spiritual/emotional need.
- **True North** – guiding moral principle.

Also implemented:

- **Contradictions** – internal tension generators.
- **Expressions** – external behavioral indicators.
- **Relationship Web** – structural relational dynamics.
- **Arc Tracking** – mapped narrative pressure points for transformation.

---

### 2. **Attribute Index**

A complete list of fulfillable fields tied to Corbett’s model:

#### 💥 Desire Examples:

- Ambition, Love, Revenge, Mastery, Belonging

#### ⚠️ Fear Examples:

- Fear of Intimacy, Failure, Irrelevance, Shame

#### 🩸 Wound Examples:

- Childhood Abuse, Betrayal, Marginalization, Grief

#### 🌌 Yearning Examples:

- To Belong, To Be Seen, To Be Forgiven, To Be Free

#### 🧭 True North Examples:

- Integrity, Compassion, Justice, Loyalty, Truth

---

## 🛠️ YAML TEMPLATE DEPLOYED

Created a **plug-and-play YAML template** compatible with:

- **Obsidian** (markdown vaults)
- **VS Code** (frontmatter modeling)
- Future support for **relational schema integration (e.g., SQLite, Neo4j)**

#### Core Features:

- Easily taggable and machine-readable.
- Fully modular with optional expansion fields (e.g., Key_Relationships, Thematic Alignment).
- Ready for character-driven plot structure synthesis and simulation porting.

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| 🔁 YAML ↔ Database Sync | Build parser to transform YAML character sheets into relational entries | Systems Lead          | 🚧 In Progress     |
| 🧠 Theme Engine Sync    | Integrate True North & Yearning with project-wide thematic scaffolding  | Narrative R&D         | 🟢 Queued          |
| 🎭 Simulation Hookup    | Port Compass model to live agent behavior tree prototype                | Narrative Systems Dev | 🔴 Not Started     |
| 🔍 Attribute Validator  | Create sanity-checker for contradiction vs. arc consistency             | QA/Narrative Tools    | 🔵 Prototype Stage |

## 🧠 STRATEGIC VALUE

- **Narrative Scalability**: Enables uniform character depth across all cast tiers.
- **Simulation-Ready**: Behavioral logic and emotional states defined at origin.
- **Thematic Precision**: Story arcs now traceable to deep moral conflicts, not just plot events.
- **Codex Integration**: Ready for inclusion in metadata-enriched worldbuilding compendium.

---

## 📦 DELIVERABLES TO DATE

- ✅ Full analytical breakdown of _The Compass of Character_
- ✅ Attribute set with fulfillable examples
- ✅ YAML-based character template (modular)
- ✅ Strategic roadmap for Phase II

---

**Final Note:**  
Character design is no longer anecdotal. It's architectural.

**Next Command: Initiate PHASE II**
