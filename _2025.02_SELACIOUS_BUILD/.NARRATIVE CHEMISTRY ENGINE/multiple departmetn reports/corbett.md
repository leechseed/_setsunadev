# üóÇÔ∏è INTERNAL REPORT: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM

**Project Codename:** Corbett Character Engine v1.0  
**Date:** 2025-04-12  
**Prepared For:** FLUBBERGLAM OPS ‚Äî Narrative Systems Division  
**Author:** Systems Architect, Character Modeling Unit

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

To design and implement a robust, narrative-anchored **Character Attribute Framework** based on _The Art of Character_ by David Corbett. This framework is intended for deployment within advanced story development pipelines across fiction, film, and simulation architectures.

---

## ‚úÖ ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO DATE

### 1. **Source Deconstruction**

- Fully analyzed _The Art of Character_ by David Corbett.
- Identified and extracted **12 core attribute domains** critical to character formation.
- Isolated **over 75 specific sub-attributes** essential for modeling human complexity in narrative systems.

### 2. **Structured Attribute List**

- Compiled a **clean, categorized list** of David Corbett‚Äôs recommended attributes.
- Each category includes logically grouped psychological, emotional, and narrative variables:
  - Identity & Surface Traits
  - Core Motivations
  - Emotional Structure
  - Psychological Complexity
  - Moral Framework
  - Backstory & Environment
  - Social Function & Relationships
  - Behavior Under Pressure
  - Secrets & Hidden Layers
  - Speech & Voice
  - Transformation & Arc
  - Narrative Function

### 3. **YAML Data Model Constructed**

- Successfully translated the entire attribute set into a **modular YAML template**.
- Ensures compatibility with:
  - Obsidian / Markdown-based knowledge systems
  - VS Code snippet libraries
  - External narrative design engines
  - SQL/NoSQL ingestible JSON formats (pending transformation layer)

### 4. **Consistency with Corbett Philosophy**

- Attribute logic preserves Corbett‚Äôs original emphasis on:
  - Inner contradiction
  - Moral tension
  - Psychological realism
  - Transformational arcs
- All values are designed to be easily expandable (multiselect, freeform, weighted).

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| **‚úÖ Attribute Library**   | Finalized YAML structure and attribute breakdown       | COMPLETE    |
| **üõ† Integration Layer**    | Build parser/translator for database or UI form inputs | IN PROGRESS |
| **üß™ Testbed Characters**  | Apply framework to 3 sample characters across genres   | UPCOMING    |
| **üìÇ Documentation Layer** | Package the model with Markdown docs for internal wiki | PENDING     |
| **‚öô Automation Snippets**  | Create YAML snippet generator for Obsidian/VS Code     | UPCOMING    |

## üöß KNOWN CHALLENGES

- üåÄ **Overlapping Attribute Domains:** Certain fields (e.g., trauma vs. emotional structure) may require tight constraints to avoid duplication in narrative logic.
- üîê **Privacy vs. Subtext:** The YAML model must preserve character secrecy (i.e., known vs. unknown to other characters) while supporting full author visibility.
- üí° **Subtextual Modeling:** Requires a layer for implications/subtext beneath dialogue and behavior markers‚Äîcurrently not formalized.
