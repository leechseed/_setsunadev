# ðŸ”¥ INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT REPORT â€” CHARACTER TEMPLATE FRAMEWORK

**Prepared by:** FLUBBERGLAM OPS â€” Narrative Systems Unit  
**Date:** 2025-04-12  
**Project Codename:** ASTRO-NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS v0.1  
**Classification:** Internal Use Only / DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

## ðŸ§  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We have initiated and structured the groundwork for a **robust, dual-layer character creation pipeline** that synthesizes **astrological personality modeling** with **narrative theory**. This document summarizes our current progress, key milestones, next steps, and technical roadmap for creating modular, extensible character templates suitable for serialized storytelling, RPG design, and AI-integrated pipelines.

## âœ… MILESTONES ACHIEVED

### 1. **Structural Alignment Between Astrology and Narrative Design**

- Defined **Big Three** (Sun, Moon, Rising) as baseline for personality and identity.
- Mapped **planetary placements** (Mars, Venus, Mercury, etc.) to **narrative levers** (drive, love language, conflict style).
- Integrated **elemental and modal dominances** (Fire, Water, Cardinal, Mutable, etc.) into behavior categorization.

### 2. **Step-by-Step Pipeline Established**

- Step 1: Build astrological profile using birth data.
- Step 2: Derive temperament, motivation, and emotional signature.
- Step 3: Generate narrative archetypes, goals, flaws, and arcs from astro-profile.
- Step 4: Synthesize into theme-aligned, narratively coherent characters.

### 3. **Unified Template Schema (YAML)**

- YAML structure drafted to encode:
  - Astrological core attributes
  - Temperament modeling
  - Narrative function
  - Emotional drivers
  - Arc synthesis
- Modular layout ensures compatibility with:
  - Obsidian frontmatter
  - AI prompt structures
  - RPG campaign frameworks

## ðŸ§© COMPONENT BREAKDOWN

### âž¤ Astrology Layer (Input)

- Full birth data intake (date, time, location)
- Planetary placements and chart aspects
- Temperament/emotional modeling via:
  - Elemental % balance
  - Modal % balance
  - Planetary dominants
  - Notable aspects (e.g., Sun square Mars)

### âž¤ Narrative Layer (Derived)

- Proppian role / Archetypal function
- Motivation / Flaw / Desire triad
- Inner vs. external conflict model
- Thematic tie-ins & symbolic resonance
- Full arc skeleton: static, growth, fall, redemption

## ðŸ“¦ OUTPUT FORMATS IN DEVELOPMENT

- âœ… YAML/Markdown hybrid templates (status: **working**)
- ðŸŸ¨ JSON export for tool integration (status: **in progress**)
- ðŸŸ¨ Form-driven template population tool (status: **pending**)
- ðŸŸ¥ AI-powered auto-generation from birth date (status: **not started**)

---

## ðŸš§ PENDING NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Build an **Astrology-to-Narrative logic engine** for automated trait mapping
- [ ] Design a **Mermaid-based character profile visualizer**
- [ ] Create sample **test characters** to validate template
- [ ] Prepare documentation for internal training and onboarding
- [ ] Determine integration path with UNICURSAL HEXOGRAM narrative logic system

---

## ðŸ“Œ SUMMARY

The FLUBBERGLAM OPS team has successfully laid the foundational groundwork for a **hybridized character design system** that fuses traditional astrology with structural narratology. This system allows for **deep psychological modeling**, **structural coherence**, and **narrative alignment**â€”ready to scale for serialized projects or simulation-heavy storytelling.
