# INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT REPORT

**Subject**: Narrative Chemistry Engine â€“ Product Discovery Phase  
**Prepared by**: Systems Architect, FLUBBERGLAM OPS  
**Date**: 2025-04-12

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the discovery and strategic framing phase of the **Narrative Chemistry Engine** (NCE), a proprietary internal tool for simulating, analyzing, and documenting complex character dynamics within a scalable, modular narrative development framework. The system is intended for personal use by a multidisciplinary creator developing long-form, cross-media intellectual property (IP).

---

## 0.1 â€“ Vision Statement

**The Narrative Chemistry Engine** is a creator-owned simulation suite designed to generate emergent narrative interactions between richly modeled characters. It serves as a **storytelling OS**â€”not a game, not a scriptwriting tool, but a system for logic-driven narrative design. It provides the backbone for simulating relationships, triggering logic-based event outcomes, and exporting documentation for use in serialized fiction, games, and AI-powered systems.

---

## 0.2 â€“ User Profile

### **Primary User Archetype**

The engine is used by a **single multidisciplinary creator** developing a cross-platform intellectual property project. This user requires tooling that spans writing, simulation, game logic, and long-form documentation, while being locally hosted, fully modular, and extensible.

### **Behavior Characteristics**

- Designs **narrative systems** and workflows, not static stories
- Works across **multiple mediums** (fiction, games, AI storytelling)
- Requires **fast iteration**, **clear system feedback**, and **structured outputs**
- Prioritizes **creator-owned tooling** over SaaS lock-ins or black-box services
- Treats software components as **modular instruments**, like plugins in DAWs

## 0.3 â€“ Problem Definition & Competitive Analysis

### **Core Problem**

No existing tool unifies character simulation, emergent relationship modeling, event-based logic scripting, and Markdown-friendly documentation under one private, extensible framework. Existing options are fragmented, proprietary, or lack the relational and simulation layers required for this use case.

### **Rejected Tools and Why**

| Tool                  | Problem                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Obsidian**          | No simulation support, plugin instability, lacks schema scalability |
| **ChatGPT**           | Creative but non-persistent and non-deterministic                   |
| **Logseq**            | Fragile and inconsistent dev cycle, weak structural modeling        |
| **VSCode**            | Excellent shell, lacks purpose-built narrative components           |
| **World Anvil**       | Presentation over process, rigid and bloated                        |
| **Notion / Airtable** | Static schemas, SaaS-locked, no simulation logic                    |

### **Why NCE Is Necessary**

- Enables **deep character modeling** with extensible traits and states
- Tracks and **simulates relationship dynamics** over time
- Produces **scene outputs and causal logs** for insight and reuse
- Outputs **Markdown documentation** for use across the creative stack
- Designed to scale with the creatorâ€™s IP as the core **narrative backbone**

## Current Progress & Outcomes

| Phase                         | Status         | Outcome                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0.1 â€“ Vision Definition       | âœ… Complete    | Established long-term purpose and scope of engine               |
| 0.2 â€“ User Profile Definition | âœ… Complete    | Fully mapped behavior and needs of primary user                 |
| 0.3 â€“ Competitive Rejection   | âœ… Complete    | Rejected all existing tooling as unsuitable or non-extensible   |
| 0.4 â€“ System Framing          | ðŸ”œ In Progress | Will define entities, verbs, rules, and simulation architecture |

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Begin **0.4 System Framing**:

   - Define all simulation entities (Characters, Traits, Relationships, Events, Groups)
   - Identify simulation verbs (e.g., tick, trigger, evaluate, bond, betray)
   - Design rule evaluation system for triggering event logic

2. Create baseline **Entity-Relationship Schema (ERS)**:

   - Draft initial database schema (Characters, Traits, Relations, Events)
   - Define field types and constraints

3. Begin **Phase 0 Prototyping Setup**:
   - Install Godot 4.x and `godot-sqlite` plugin
   - Build initial `world.db` and connect to simulation scaffold
   - Design tick system and event evaluation loop

---

## Final Note

The Narrative Chemistry Engine is a foundational project. It is not a utility, but a **narrative infrastructure platform**. It is designed to:

- Evolve alongside creative needs
- Provide simulation-driven storytelling power
- Become the root logic layer behind future fiction, games, and generative media projects

Further development will proceed under **FLUBBERGLAM OPS Dev Protocol 001**, with structured logs and milestone tracking beginning at the next phase.
