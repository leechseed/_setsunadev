# üü¢ PROJECT INITIATION: NARRATIVE SIMULATION ENGINE

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Charter (Based on `simulation_manifesto.md`)

- **Project Name**: Narrative Simulation Engine (Codename: GOON BUILD 0.0)
- **Executive Sponsor**: Hubertimus Magillicutty
- **Mission**: To build a modular, tick-based narrative simulation framework that procedurally generates rich, internally consistent lore and symbolic systems for use in IP development.
- **Vision**: Establish a simulation system that blends stat logic (GURPS), symbolic meaning, and mythopoeic structure to enable emergent, scalable narrative content across time and civilizations.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Create a reusable system for generating:
  - Civilizations, cultures, and factions
  - Characters, timelines, and backstories
  - Symbolic structures (e.g., gods, relics, rituals)
- Design modular architecture using:
  - Pluggable domains
  - Archetype-driven logic
  - Timeline branching & replay engine
- Export in creative-ready formats:
  - YAML (characters)
  - Markdown (timelines, lore, factions)
