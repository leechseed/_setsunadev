## 📦 Export & Deployment Package

### 🔹 Finalized Assets

- `exports/characters/*.yaml`
- `exports/factions/*.md`
- `exports/timelines/*.md`
- `exports/lore/*.md`

### 🔹 Schema Lock

- Freeze `simulation.yaml` spec and domain interface contract
- Document versioned APIs for plugin integration
- Tag final schema versions for:
  - `character_export_v1`
  - `timeline_export_v1`
  - `symbolic_tag_v1`

## 📚 Archival Plan

| Artifact                        | Location                     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Documentation Archive           | `/docs/`                     |
| Symbolic Schema Definitions     | `/docs/symbolic_layer.md`    |
| Forked Timelines                | `/exports/timelines/forked/` |
| Plugin Registry                 | `/plugins/registry.yaml`     |
| System Snapshots (tick-stamped) | `/snapshots/*.zip`           |

## 🔁 Retrospective Summary

### What Went Well

- Symbolic layering and archetype propagation met design goals
- Export format is modular, readable, and immediately usable
- AI agent integration allowed dynamic narrative testing at scale

### What Could Improve

- EventQueue bottlenecks under stress (resolved via domain threading)
- Some symbolic tags require deeper context parsing (future NLP expansion)

---

## 📜 Certification of Completion

This project has fulfilled its original charter under the design goals of:

- Symbolic narrative emergence
- Procedural world and character generation
- Modular architecture for pluggability and lore reuse

All documentation, exports, schemas, and protocols are locked in v1.

## 🟢 READY FOR DEPLOYMENT OR ITERATION

Say: `"begin simulation"` to start generating lore in production mode.

Say: `"enter v2 planning"` to begin roadmap for Simulation Engine v2.0.
