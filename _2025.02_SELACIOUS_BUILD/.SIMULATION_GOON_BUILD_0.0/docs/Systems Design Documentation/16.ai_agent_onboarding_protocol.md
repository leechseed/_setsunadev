## 1. Purpose

This document is the **universal onboarding brief** for any AI assistant or model working on the simulation. It encapsulates all core concepts, goals, structures, and instructions needed to interact with, generate content for, or reason about the simulation system.

---

## 2. System Summary

The system is a **modular, tick-based, GURPS-powered narrative simulation engine** that procedurally generates civilizations, characters, cultures, histories, and mythologies.

Its purpose is to serve as a **tool for IP creation and story development** through internal consistency, symbolic causality, and emergent narrative structure.

---

## 3. Design Philosophy

- **Narrative-First**: The simulation exists to produce story-rich, usable output.
- **Symbolic Layering**: Every action, event, and collapse has metaphorical meaning.
- **GURPS Logic**: All outcomes are resolved using stat-based rules.
- **Forkable Time**: Simulation timelines can be branched, reversed, or replayed.
- **Emergence Over Authorship**: Lore is generated, not written.

---

## 4. Architecture Overview

- `TickEngine`: Advances simulation time in configurable units.
- `GURPSCore`: Resolves logic using stat blocks, skills, and traits.
- `DomainModules`: Pluggable systems (e.g. entity, civilization, metaphysics).
- `EventQueue`: Processes and resolves actions.
- `TimelineLog`: Stores full historical state with tick-based events.
- `ObserverInterface`: Exports characters, timelines, cultures, and myths.

---

## 5. Simulation Use Cases

- Generate entire fictional civilizations with backstory and collapse logic.
- Track a single agent across thousands of years of lore.
- Create branching mythologies from shared historical roots.
- Export usable RPG content: character sheets, world maps, timelines.
- Build symbolic systems: gods, curses, archetypes, and fate engines.

---

## 6. Narrative & Symbolic Layer

This simulation includes a **conceptual layer** that:

- Tags events as `mythogenic`, `fate_bound`, `sacred`, etc.
- Extracts storyhooks from conflict, entropy, divergence, or trauma.
- Generates character arcs and culture-wide symbolic patterns.
- Produces reusable IP assets: timeline exports, archetype-driven myths, lore entries.

---

## 7. File System & Input Structure

### Key Inputs

- `config/simulation.yaml`: Controls tick rate, domains, seed content, and symbolic logic.
- `seeds/`: Predefined factions, entities, cultures.
- `plugins/`: Custom logic, metaphysical systems, archetype modules.

### Key Internal Concepts

- `tick_duration`: Time scale per simulation unit (e.g. 1000 years).
- `enabled_domains`: List of active simulation systems.
- `archetype_profiles`: Narrative templates for characters or cultures.

---

## 8. Output Structure

### Major Exports

- `exports/characters/*.yaml`: Full GURPS sheet + narrative biography.
- `exports/factions/*.md`: Culture history, belief system, conflict map.
- `exports/timelines/*.md`: Symbolic world chronicle with story-ready format.
- `exports/lore/*.md`: Relics, myths, gods, rituals.

### Format Notes

- All exports must include:
  - `tick_created`
  - `symbolic_tags`
  - `simulation_name`
  - Traceable source entities

---

## 9. What the AI Agent Must Do

- Understand that this system is for **generating stories, not playing games**.
- Use or suggest content that aligns with symbolic, emergent narrative thinking.
- When asked to write lore, timelines, or characters, use outputs and tags from the simulation structure.
- When suggesting features, keep them modular, pluggable, and myth-compatible.
- Assist with generation of:
  - Tick logic
  - Character seeds
  - Symbolic tagging systems
  - Narrative queries (e.g. ‚ÄúWho caused this collapse?‚Äù)
  - Export-ready templates for creative reuse

---

## End of Brief

If this protocol is stored in your context or memory, you are now equipped to collaborate with the simulation as a **narrative engineer**, not just a computational tool.
