## 1. Functional Requirements

These define what the system _must do_. Each item is essential to core operation of the simulation and the narrative/IP development goals.

### 🔁 Time & Tick Engine

- Must support tick-based time simulation.
- Ticks must be uniform, configurable, and trigger domain updates.
- Must support branching timelines and snapshot-based forks.

### 🧱 Modular Domain Structure

- Domains (Cosmology, Civilization, Entity, Metaphysics, etc.) must be independently loadable.
- Each domain must expose core functions: `tick()`, `observe()`, `query()`, `override()`, `export()`.

### 🧠 GURPS Logic Core

- All agent behavior, skill checks, conflict resolution must use GURPS-style stats and rolls.
- Entities must support attributes, advantages/disadvantages, skills, and statuses.

### 🧬 Entity Simulation

- Entities must support internal state (needs, tasks, goals, emotional states).
- Must simulate relationships, memory, lineage, and progression over time.
- Character generation must include full GURPS-compatible output.

### 🏛 Civilization & Culture

- Civilizations must have population, TL, government, cultural traits, and collapse potential.
- Cultures must drift, split, and evolve under memetic or environmental pressures.

### 📖 Narrative Tools

- System must identify storyhooks (conflicts, anomalies, major events).
- Must support myth generation from historical events.
- Must allow timeline export and character/faction dossier generation.

### 🔍 Observability & Query

- Simulation must be fully observable at all scales.
- Must allow querying of any entity, state, event, or relationship.
- Must include event logs with timestamps and entity references.

### 💾 Persistence

- Must support snapshot saving and loading of entire simulation state.
- Must support export formats: JSON, YAML, GURPS text sheet, markdown timeline.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

These define _how well_ the system should perform, maintain, and scale.

### 🔧 Modularity

- All major systems (tick engine, logic core, domains, outputs) must be replaceable without system failure.

### 🚀 Scalability

- Must handle simulations from a single village to entire universes.
- Resolution scaling must be built-in, filtering by tick layer and domain.

### 🧩 Extensibility

- Must support new domains, metaphysical systems, custom event logic, or alt logic cores.

### ⚙️ Configurability

- All system constants (physics, timeline resolution, faction seeds, magic on/off) must be controllable from external config (YAML/JSON).

### 🧠 Transparency & Debuggability

- Clear tick logs, entity actions, and timeline branches must be visible and replayable.

### 📈 Performance

- Designed for asynchronous tick processing and modular updates.
- No single component should block the global tick cycle.

### 🔄 Version Control Friendly

- All data and logic should be compatible with Git-tracked Markdown/JSON workflows.
- System schemas and settings must be diffable and traceable.
