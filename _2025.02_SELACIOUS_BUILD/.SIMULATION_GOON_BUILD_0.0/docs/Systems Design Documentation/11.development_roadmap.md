## 1. Purpose

This document provides a structured roadmap for building the simulation system from first commit to full-scale IP-generation tool. It outlines the phases, tools, milestones, and key architectural decisions to ensure a stable, extensible foundation for long-term creative and technical scalability.

---

## 2. Development Philosophy

- **Iterate with integrity**: Build working vertical slices before adding complexity.
- **Symbol-first logic**: Everything you build should serve both simulation mechanics and narrative meaning.
- **Test modularity early**: Domains and systems should be pluggable from the start.
- **Design for reuse**: The end goal is not just a simulation, but a reusable IP generation engine.

## 3. Phase Overview

| Phase | Focus                              | Output               |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1     | Tick engine + entity system        | Time + agents        |
| 2     | GURPS logic core + task engine     | Resolution framework |
| 3     | Civilization + culture domains     | Factional behavior   |
| 4     | Timeline + snapshot engine         | Traceable history    |
| 5     | Narrative tagging + symbolic logic | Conceptual layer     |
| 6     | Output system + observer UI        | IP extraction        |
| 7     | Metaphysics + archetype engine     | Optional domain      |
| 8     | Forking + replay engine            | Branching timelines  |

## 4. Milestone Breakdown

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Time + Entity System

- [ ] Implement `TickEngine`
- [ ] Create `EntityDomain` with basic agents
- [ ] Store timeline state in memory
- [ ] Export snapshot as JSON

### âœ… Phase 2: GURPS Logic Core

- [ ] Stat blocks: ST, DX, IQ, HT
- [ ] Skill rolls, reaction rolls, margin-of-success
- [ ] Resolve events via logic core
- [ ] Add basic task engine to agents

### âœ… Phase 3: Civilization + Culture

- [ ] Implement `CivilizationDomain`
- [ ] Define political structure, pop stats, TL
- [ ] Add `CultureDomain` (memetics, belief systems)

### âœ… Phase 4: Timeline & Snapshot Engine

- [ ] Store per-tick logs with metadata
- [ ] Snapshot entire sim state
- [ ] Enable rollback and fork scaffolding

### âœ… Phase 5: Narrative & Symbolic Layer

- [ ] Add conceptual tagging (`mythogenic`, `fate_bound`)
- [ ] Scan for storyhooks and symbolic events
- [ ] Archetype tagging engine

### âœ… Phase 6: Output System

- [ ] GURPS sheet exporter
- [ ] Markdown timeline export
- [ ] Observer API: `observe(entity)`, `get_hooks()`

### âœ… Phase 7: Metaphysics (Optional)

- [ ] Add symbolic logic: karma, fate, psi, gods
- [ ] Track metaphysical states/entities
- [ ] Tie into entropy, belief, narrative events

### âœ… Phase 8: Replay & Fork Engine

- [ ] Save/load timeline branches
- [ ] Support multiverse comparisons
- [ ] Export divergent timelines

## 5. Tooling & Stack

| Component     | Toolset                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Language      | Python (initial), possible Rust for scale         |
| Storage       | SQLite for states, CSV/Markdown for export        |
| Config        | YAML                                              |
| Logic Core    | Custom GURPS-style engine                         |
| UI (Optional) | Text interface or web dashboard (TUI/Flask/React) |
| Editor Use    | Obsidian, VS Code, Git, Mermaid.js for diagrams   |

## 6. Versioning Strategy

- `v0.1.0`: Minimal working prototype (ticks, entities, exports)
- `v0.2.0`: Logic core + basic resolution
- `v0.3.0`: Full civ/culture simulation
- `v0.4.0`: Snapshot/fork support
- `v1.0.0`: Narrative-capable, IP-export ready

All major logic schemas will be versioned in `meta.version` fields across exports.

---

## 7. Documentation & Deliverables

- [x] Simulation Manifesto
- [x] Stakeholder Goals
- [x] Use Case Matrix
- [x] Tick Cycle & Architecture
- [x] Settings Schema
- [x] Domain Contract
- [x] Output System Spec
- [x] Conceptual Layer Framework
- [x] Development Roadmap

All documents stored as `.md` in a version-controlled directory and exportable as bundles.

## Summary

This roadmap is a battle plan: a step-by-step path from zero to world-scale narrative simulator. If followed, it will yield not only a functioning simulation system, but a **reusable IP generator** with symbolic depth and mechanical precisionâ€”designed to turn raw possibility into actual mythology.
