## 1. Purpose

This document describes the system responsible for **forking alternate timelines** and **replaying past simulation states**. These functions enable what-if analysis, alternate histories, divergent myth branches, and rollback logic for creative exploration or debugging.

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### Timeline

A chronologically ordered sequence of ticks and events.

### Snapshot

A serialized dump of simulation state at a given tick. Used to restore or fork simulation.

### Branch

A new simulation path created from a previously recorded snapshot.

### Replay

A deterministic re-execution of previous simulation logic to re-generate or compare a timeline.

## 3. Forking Triggers

| Trigger             | Description                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Manual              | User selects tick to fork from                 |
| Narrative Branch    | Symbolic event triggers alternate reality      |
| Simulation Override | Forced intervention (e.g. reverse war outcome) |
| Entropic Threshold  | System auto-forks on high entropy collapse     |

---

## 4. Snapshot Structure

Snapshots must include:

```yaml
snapshot:
  tick: 4200
  version: 0.4.1
  state:
    - domains: full serialized state of each active domain
    - config: active settings
    - log_state: timestamped event queue
    - metaphysics: optional symbolic system data
  metadata:
    created_by: "observer_ui"
    notes: "Pre-collapse fork of Ashborn Choir"
```

## 5. Replay Modes

| Mode                 | Description                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deterministic Replay | Re-run simulation using same seed/settings                 |
| Observational Replay | Step through previous ticks without altering state         |
| Divergent Replay     | Fork simulation and apply changes (intervention, mutation) |

---

## 6. Conflict Resolution

### Fork Conflicts

If forking with modified logic/settings:

- Simulation must flag branch as divergent
- Metadata must reflect configuration diffs

### Event Rewriting

If replaying with modified physics or narrative layer, engine must:

- Allow manual validation of divergence points
- Optionally resolve via narrative logic (e.g., myth override)

---

## 7. Interface & Control Methods

### Methods

- `fork(tick_id)`: Creates new timeline from given snapshot
- `snapshot.save(tick_id)`: Manually save current simulation state
- `replay(tick_id, mode="deterministic")`: Re-execute tick logic
- `compare_timeline(branch_1, branch_2)`: Diff timelines
- `timeline.log.get_hooks()`: Return list of symbolic branch points

---

## 8. Use Cases

| Scenario                      | Result                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reverse the fall of an empire | Fork from the tick before collapse, change decision tree |
| Create parallel mythologies   | Generate alternate outcomes from same worldseed          |
| Debug simulation path         | Replay from tick 1000 and inspect agent choices          |
| Explore symbolic inversion    | Fork world where fire cults worship darkness instead     |

---

## Summary

The forking and replay engine gives the simulation narrative multiplicity. It turns your simulation from a single deterministic line into a branching **narrative cosmos**â€”where symbolic causality and mythic divergence can be studied, rewritten, or creatively exploited.
