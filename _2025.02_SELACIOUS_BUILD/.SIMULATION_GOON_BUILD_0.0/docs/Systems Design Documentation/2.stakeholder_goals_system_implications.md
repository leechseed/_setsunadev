## 1. Primary Stakeholder: IP Architect & Narrative Designer

### üéØ Goals

- Use the simulation to **generate dynamic timelines**, **cultures**, **factions**, **characters**, and **technological paths**.
- Enable full **zoom control**: observe and extract data from universal down to personal scale.
- Leverage **GURPS logic** to resolve all action, behavior, and evolution in the system.
- Simulate with the intention to **mine stories**‚Äînot just observe events.
- Retain full control over initial conditions, logic layers, and settings for **custom mythos and world structures**.
- Build a system where **coherence emerges**, not one where everything is handcrafted manually.

### üß† System Implications

- Requires **narrative-aware modules** (storyhooks, myth systems, factional arcs).
- Entities, civilizations, and domains must support both **stat-based logic** _and_ **symbolic/narrative functions**.
- Time is handled via **ticks**; scale is emergent via domain resolution layers.
- **Observers** must be able to trace meaning from past events and extract usable lore.
- **Settings schema** must support narrative constraints, themes, and metaphysical rulesets.

## 2. Secondary Stakeholder: Simulation Architect

### üéØ Goals

- Create a system that is **modular, hot-swappable, and extensible**.
- Maintain **logical separation** between time engine, domain modules, logic resolution, and output systems.
- Ensure the engine is **data-driven and observable** for later automation or narrative control loops.
- Enable **plug-and-play domain development** (magic, AI, culture, entropy, etc).

### üß† System Implications

- Requires **plugin-based architecture** for every module.
- Tick engine must be universal, with hooks for domains and agents.
- Logic must remain GURPS-compatible but **abstracted from entity type** (person, civ, star).
- Timeline logging must support **serialization, branching, and snapshot replay**.

## 3. Tertiary Stakeholder: Observer/Analyst

### üéØ Goals

- Watch simulations evolve without interference.
- Query any past state, event, or entity.
- Pull **narrative threads** from system (e.g., ‚Äúwho caused this collapse?‚Äù).
- Compare divergent outcomes across timeline forks.

### üß† System Implications

- Requires full observability: real-time and historical.
- Exposes public query interface (tick logs, entity timelines, cultural trajectories).
- Simulation state must be exportable as text, data, GURPS sheets, and timelines.
- Timeline state must support **branching**, **versioning**, and **narrative replay**.

## 4. Quaternary Stakeholder: Simulated Agents

### üéØ Goals

- Function autonomously using **GURPS logic + domain traits**.
- React to environment and events using internal logic.
- Develop relationships, fail or succeed, grow or decay, _and carry meaning_.
- Serve as narrative vessels, whether they live a day or shape galactic history.

### üß† System Implications

- Every agent must have:
  - GURPS stat block
  - Task logic
  - Memory
  - Relationship map
  - Cultural tags
- Agents must generate logs, decisions, and emergent meaning for **story extraction**.

| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simulation supports narrative/IP development              | All modules                      | System must produce symbolic, mythic, and character output |
| Scalable from universe to individual                      | Tick Engine, Domain Architecture | Resolution filtering and nested domain updates             |

| Observer visibility with narrative traceability           | Output, Tick Logs                | Timeline and agent events must be fully traceable          |
