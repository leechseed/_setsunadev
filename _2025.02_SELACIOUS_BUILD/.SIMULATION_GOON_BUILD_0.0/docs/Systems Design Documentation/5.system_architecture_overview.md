## 1. System Summary

This simulation engine is a modular, tick-driven, GURPS-powered narrative system designed to simulate the evolution of universes, civilizations, and characters. Its primary function is to serve worldbuilding and IP development by generating symbolic, traceable, and causally consistent timelines, agents, and cultural structures.

## 3. Subsystem Descriptions

### Simulation Settings Loader

- Loads configuration (YAML or JSON) defining physics constants, timeline resolution, domain toggles, narrative flags, and faction seeds.

### Tick Engine

- Controls global simulation time.
- Executes tick cycles that drive all domain modules.

### GURPS Logic Core

- Responsible for stat-based resolution: skill checks, opposed rolls, reaction rolls, and outcomes based on margin of success.
- Stateless and interchangeable.

### Domain Modules

| Module       | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cosmology    | Simulates space expansion, entropy, galactic structure.       |
| Planetary    | Manages planet states: terrain, climate, orbit, habitability. |
| Civilization | Simulates governments, economies, populations, collapse.      |
| Culture      | Handles memetic drift, religions, rituals, social norms.      |
| Entity       | Creates and simulates characters with full GURPS stat blocks. |
| Metaphysics  | Optional symbolic system (gods, psi, magic, fate engines).    |

Each module implements:

- `tick()` â€“ advance internal state per tick
- `observe()` â€“ expose current state to external systems
- `query()` â€“ return requested entity or status
- `override()` â€“ allow runtime modification or event injection
- `export()` â€“ provide narrative or data output for logs or viewers

### Event Queue & Resolution Engine

- Collects action proposals and systemic triggers from domain modules.
- Uses GURPS Logic Core to resolve interactions and apply consequences.
- Communicates changes to Timeline Log and domain state.

### Timeline Log & Snapshot Engine

- Maintains full record of simulation events with entity references and timestamps.
- Supports save/load snapshots, time branching, and full timeline exports.

### Output Layer

- Allows user to inspect, observe, or extract data from any layer.
- Exports GURPS sheets, markdown timelines, civ/faction summaries, and agent reports.
- Optional front-end or CLI-based visualization tools.

## 4. Data Flow Overview

1. Settings are loaded via the Simulation Settings Loader.
2. Tick Engine begins advancing time.
3. On each tick:
   - Domain Modules execute internal updates via `tick()`.
   - Events are sent to the Event Queue.
   - GURPS Logic Core resolves events.
   - Results update states and are logged by the Timeline Log.
4. Output Layer processes results for viewing, analysis, and narrative export.

## 5. Architectural Principles

| Principle           | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modularity          | All domains and systems must be plug-and-play.                          |
| Observability       | Full traceability of entities, states, and actions.                     |
| GURPS-First Logic   | All outcomes governed by attributes, skills, and stats.                 |
| Narrative Utility   | Output formats must support IP extraction (stories, timelines, sheets). |
| Resolution Scaling  | Simulation must update at multiple nested scales.                       |
| Data-Driven Configs | All settings must be externally defined and editable.                   |
| Plugin-Friendly     | Developers can inject new systems without core rewrites.                |
