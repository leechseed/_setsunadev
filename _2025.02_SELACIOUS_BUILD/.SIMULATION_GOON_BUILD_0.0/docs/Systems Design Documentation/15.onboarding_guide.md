## 1. Purpose

This guide provides everything a **developer or narrative designer** needs to understand, extend, and use the simulation system. Whether youâ€™re writing logic modules or crafting emergent mythologies, this document will align you with the projectâ€™s architecture and creative goals.

## 2. User Roles

| Role                   | Access     | Primary Activities                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Developer**          | Full       | Build systems, modules, plugins, logic             |
| **Narrative Designer** | Read/Write | Configure settings, extract story, design factions |
| **Observer**           | Read       | Monitor outcomes, export states, analyze dynamics  |

## 3. System Overview for Onboarding

### Core Loop

1. Load simulation config
2. Initialize tick engine and domains
3. Domains tick and generate events
4. Events resolved by GURPS logic
5. Timeline logs and outputs are updated
6. Snapshots + narrative exports available

### Architecture Highlights

- Modular: Each domain is its own plugin
- GURPS Logic Core drives all simulation decisions
- Conceptual Layer tags events with symbolic meaning
- Forkable timeline structure allows alternate histories

---

## 4. Getting Started (Dev)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- VSCode or similar
- Git for version control

### Setup Steps

1. Clone repo:

   ```bash
   git clone your-repo-url
   cd simulation-engine
   ```

2. Install requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run minimal prototype:

   ```bash
   python main.py --config=config/simulation.yaml
   ```

4. Add new domain:  
   Create `domains/mydomain.py` and register it in the loader.

5. Implement interface:
   ```python
   class MyDomain:
       def tick(self, state, tick): ...
       def query(self, data): ...
       def export(self): ...
   ```

---

## 5. Getting Started (Narrative)

### Configure Simulation

1. Open `/config/simulation.yaml`
2. Define:
   - `enabled_domains`
   - `starting factions`
   - `tick_duration`
   - `narrative_mode: true`

### Launch Simulation

```bash
python main.py --config=config/simulation.yaml
```

### Export Lore

- View timeline: `exports/timelines/world.md`
- Export GURPS character: `exports/characters/ziran_vey.yaml`
- Extract myth: `exports/lore/hollow_flame.md`

---

## 6. Creating & Editing Content

| Content Type    | Where to Edit            |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Civilizations   | `seeds/factions.yaml`    |
| Characters      | `seeds/entities.yaml`    |
| Myths/Symbols   | `plugins/metaphysics/`   |
| Timeline Labels | `conceptual/tags.yaml`   |
| Archetypes      | `config/archetypes.yaml` |

You may also inject mid-simulation with:

```python
engine.override("add_faction", data)
```

---

## 7. Testing, Debugging, and Observing

### Debugging Tools

- `tick.pause()`, `tick.resume()`
- `observe(entity_id)`, `query(state)`
- `get_hooks()`, `get_log(tick_range)`

### Logs

- Tick Log: `logs/tick.csv`
- Event Log: `logs/events.json`
- Timeline Markdown: `exports/timelines/`

### Snapshot

```bash
python main.py --snapshot save --tick 4000
```

---

## 8. Best Practices

- Keep domain logic **stateless where possible**
- Add `version` fields to all exports for compatibility
- Use **symbolic tags** consistently (`fate_bound`, `mythogenic`, etc.)
- Fork often, log often, export always
- Donâ€™t write lore by handâ€”**let it emerge**

---

## Summary

This system is as much a creative tool as a technical one. If you can model a belief system, simulate a civil war, or birth a myth from entropyâ€”you're doing it right. The goal is **coherence + emergence**, **narrative + modularity**. Build with purpose, write with chaos.
