## 1. Purpose

This document defines how simulation data is observed, extracted, exported, and reused. Outputs are not just for debuggingâ€”theyâ€™re a critical part of the system's role in narrative development and IP extraction. Every simulation run must be readable, navigable, exportable, and symbolically interpretable.

## 2. Output Categories

| Category       | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logs           | Tick-by-tick record of events, actions, and changes.    |
| Snapshots      | Full-state export of the simulation at a point in time. |
| Timelines      | Human-readable summaries of major historical events.    |
| Character Data | Exported GURPS sheets, bios, and development arcs.      |
| Civ/Faction    | Narrative + stat summaries of civilizations/factions.   |
| Myth/Hook      | Story seeds, symbolic events, and lore-ready content.   |

---

## 3. Export Formats

| Format  | Use Case                                                  |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.md`   | Human-readable timelines, bios, lorebooks                 |
| `.json` | Structured programmatic export (interoperable with tools) |
| `.yaml` | Readable config-style format (versionable and extensible) |
| `.csv`  | Optional for tabular summaries (stats, timeline metadata) |

---

## 4. Export Triggers

| Trigger Type    | Description                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual Export   | Developer or writer triggers snapshot/export.              |
| Tick Threshold  | Export every N ticks (configurable interval).              |
| Event-Based     | Auto-export on major storyhook or symbolic event.          |
| Observer Query  | User inspects an entity, which triggers exportable output. |
| Post-Sim Export | End of sim generates full report bundle.                   |

---

## 5. Observer Interface Capabilities

The output system is integrated with the observer console or UI.

| Capability                 | Description                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `observe(entity_id)`       | View GURPS stat block, tasks, timeline for agent |
| `observe(faction)`         | View beliefs, conflicts, historical changes      |
| `get_timeline(start, end)` | Return narrative events between ticks            |
| `export_state(tick)`       | Save snapshot at a specific time                 |
| `get_hooks()`              | Return story seeds based on tension patterns     |

## 7. Design Requirements

| Requirement                  | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Traceability                 | All outputs must include source tick, actor IDs, and cause.     |
| Readability                  | Markdown exports must be usable by writers immediately.         |
| Compatibility                | JSON/YAML must match schema versioning for toolchain use.       |
| Narrativization              | Hooks and timelines must include symbolic or emotional framing. |
| Configurable Export Policies | Triggers and formats must be adjustable in settings file.       |

## Summary

The output system transforms raw simulation data into lore, sheets, and symbolic narratives. It empowers designers and writers to mine their simulated universes for IP-grade materialâ€”from empires and tech paths to personal tragedies and legendary relics.
