## 1. Purpose

This document defines reusable **export templates** that convert simulation outputs into usable, clean, and stylized documents for inclusion in world bibles, RPG manuals, or serialized fiction planning. These profiles are human-readable, markdown-native, and designed for long-form narrative reuse.

---

## 2. Export Philosophy

- **Narrative-first**: Exports are structured as lore-ready content.
- **Editable**: Designed to be dropped into Obsidian, VSCode, or docs.
- **Traceable**: Origin tick, symbolic tags, and world context preserved.
- **Stylized**: Markdown or YAML presentation with optional prose formatting.

## 7. Timeline Export Template

```markdown
# ðŸ“œ Timeline: The Fall of Emberglass

Simulation: Godseed Chronicles  
Generated at tick: 6200

## Key Events

- Tick 3050: The Emberglass Pact is signed between five high-factions.
- Tick 3900: First signals of corruption in the Glass Priory.
- Tick 4420: Betrayal of the Mirror-Arm and burning of the Prophet-Crypt.
- Tick 4800: Fall of the Emberglass Citadel.
- Tick 5200: Emergence of a mythic figureâ€”"The Hollow Flame."

## Summary

The Fall of Emberglass marks the symbolic end of the Fire Doctrine. Its slow unraveling, internal betrayal, and ideological implosion became the basis for three major myths and one rogue faction.
```

---

## 8. Lorebook Export Template

```markdown
# ðŸ“˜ Lorebook Entry: The Hollow Flame

Symbolic Tags: [anti-fire, rebirth, mythogenic]

## Description

The Hollow Flame is a recurring symbol in post-collapse narratives. It appears as an inverted fireâ€”a cold light that represents silence, judgment, and internal void. In some belief systems, it is a guardian. In others, it is a curse.

## First Emergence

- Tick 5200, one generation after the Fall of Emberglass

## Cultural Significance

- Adopted by the Obsidian Refrain cult as proof of divine entropy
- Used as a warning glyph in Mirror faiths

## Narrative Utility

The Hollow Flame offers a powerful metaphor for the loss of belief, failure of leadership, and emotional numbness after cultural collapse.
```

## Summary

Export profiles bridge simulation mechanics with expressive narrative. Each export type functions as a **source artifact** within your creative ecosystemâ€”instantly usable in worldbibles, RPGs, novels, or serialized media frameworks.
