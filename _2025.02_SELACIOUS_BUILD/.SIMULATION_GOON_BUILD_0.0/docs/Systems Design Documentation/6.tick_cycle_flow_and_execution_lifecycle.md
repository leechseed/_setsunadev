## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the exact structure and control logic behind simulation time. The tick engine is the beating heart of the systemâ€”advancing time, triggering modules, and resolving events. Understanding tick flow is key to both performance optimization and symbolic narrative development.

---

## 2. Tick Cycle Overview

Each tick represents a discrete unit of simulation time. Every active domain is updated in sequence or parallel, and events are resolved through the logic core. Simulation progression is entirely governed by the tick system.

---

## 3. Tick Execution Stages

Each tick proceeds through the following canonical stages:

1. **TICK_START**

   - Tick counter increments
   - Clock data (year, season, epoch) updates
   - Entropy modifiers apply (if active)

2. **DOMAIN_UPDATE**

   - Each loaded domain executes its `tick()` function
   - Domains may generate actions or events

3. **EVENT_COLLECTION**

   - All triggered or pending actions/events are added to the Event Queue

4. **EVENT_RESOLUTION**

   - Each event is resolved via the GURPS Logic Core
   - Outcome changes entity states, world states, or global variables

5. **STATE_COMMIT**

   - Finalized changes are written to simulation memory/state tables

6. **TICK_LOGGING**

   - All events, state changes, and interactions are timestamped and recorded

7. **SNAPSHOT (optional)**

   - If configured, a save-state of the world is captured for forking/replay

8. **TICK_END**
   - System becomes ready for next tick or observer inspection

---

## 4. Lifecycle Events

### Primary Triggers:

- Scheduled task (e.g., tick every X seconds or manual step)
- Scripted scene progression
- External simulation override (replay, fork, backtrack)

### Observer Hooks:

- `before_tick()`: Read system state before updates
- `after_tick()`: Observe post-resolution state
- `tick_diff()`: Compare between ticks for analysis or visualization

## 5. Time Resolution & Scaling

| Tick Size  | Description                          | Use Case                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 1 second   | Real-time or symbolic micro-behavior | Action resolution, speech     |
| 1 day      | Agent simulation, memory formation   | Character-level progression   |
| 1 year     | Cultural change, lifespan simulation | Long-form civ analysis        |
| 1000 years | Epochal or mythic evolution          | Cosmogony, galactic structure |

Ticks are fully configurable via the simulation settings file.

## 6. Tick Control Features

### Configurable Features:

- `tick_duration`: Integer or symbolic unit (e.g., `100 years`)
- `tick_mode`: `real-time` | `step` | `auto-batch`
- `snapshot_interval`: Save state every N ticks
- `entropy_rate`: Control heat-death, information decay
- `event_roll_limit`: Cap per-tick resolution workload

### Debug/Control Functions:

- `tick.pause()`: Stop simulation for inspection
- `tick.resume()`: Resume ticking
- `tick.rewind(n)`: Roll back N ticks from snapshot
- `tick.branch()`: Create forked timeline
- `tick.jump(target_tick)`: Skip ahead (if deterministic state supported)

---

## Summary

The tick engine enables deterministic or emergent behavior across the entire simulation. By framing time as modular and symbolic, the simulation remains both **mechanically rigorous** and **narratively expressive**, allowing every tick to serve as a potential storybeat, era marker, or myth trigger.
