## 1. Purpose

This document defines the formal interface required by all domain modules used in the simulation system. By enforcing a unified contract, the simulation engine can seamlessly manage diverse domains (e.g., Cosmology, Entity, Culture) while maintaining modularity, pluggability, and system coherence.

---

## 2. Overview

Each domain in the simulation (e.g., `civilization`, `entity`, `culture`, etc.) must be implemented as a self-contained module that adheres to a known structure. The simulation engine invokes and coordinates these modules during each tick cycle, snapshot, or query.

---

## 3. Required Interface Methods

Each domain **must** implement the following methods:

### `tick(state, tick_number)`

- Advances the domainâ€™s internal state by one simulation tick.
- Accepts current state and tick ID.
- Returns any generated events, updates, or proposed changes.

### `observe()`

- Returns the current public-facing state of the domain.
- Used by observers, exporters, and interface tools.

### `query(query_object)`

- Accepts a structured query (e.g., character ID, faction name).
- Returns matching data or computed result.

### `override(patch)`

- Applies an externally provided state mutation (used for forks, interventions, or scripting).

### `export()`

- Serializes domain state into a portable format (YAML, JSON, markdown).
- Used for timeline export, snapshot saves, or lore generation.

---

## 4. Optional Extension Methods

Domains may optionally implement these if relevant:

### `initialize(config)`

- Handles setup logic using provided simulation settings.
- Recommended for seed-based or config-driven domains.

### `rollback(tick_number)`

- Reverts domain state to the closest snapshot â‰¤ `tick_number`.

### `on_event(event)`

- Responds to global or cross-domain events.

## 5. Domain Lifecycle Integration

| Stage           | Engine Call          | Description                               |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Init            | `initialize(config)` | One-time setup during simulation startup  |
| Per Tick        | `tick()`             | Advances logic and generates state/events |
| Query           | `query()`            | Used by observers or UI interfaces        |
| Modify          | `override()`         | Used during manual or AI intervention     |
| Export Snapshot | `export()`           | Serializes current domain state           |

---

## 6. Compliance Rules

- All methods must be **pure or state-contained**: no global variable pollution.
- Every domain must be able to function independently of others unless dependency is declared in its metadata.
- Domains must raise clear errors when called with invalid input.
- Export data must include version tags for forward/backward compatibility.

---

## 7. Example Implementation Skeleton

```python
class EntityDomain:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.state = {}
        self.config = config

    def initialize(self, config):
        # Load entity templates or seeds
        pass

    def tick(self, state, tick_number):
        # Advance entity logic and return events
        return []

    def observe(self):
        # Return public data
        return self.state

    def query(self, query_object):
        # Return a specific character or result
        return self.state.get(query_object.get("id"))

    def override(self, patch):
        # Apply mutation to entity state
        self.state.update(patch)

    def export(self):
        # Return data in externalized format
        return self.state
```

---

## Summary

This domain interface contract ensures that all simulation modules remain modular, predictable, and composable. By requiring domains to conform to a shared structure, the simulation engine can efficiently coordinate large-scale complexity while supporting hot-swappable domains, narrative hooks, and symbolic resolution.
