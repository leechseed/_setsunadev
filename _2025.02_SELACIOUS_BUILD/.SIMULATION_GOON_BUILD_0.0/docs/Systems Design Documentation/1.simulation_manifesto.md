## 1. Purpose

This document is the universal onboarding brief for any AI assistant or model working on the simulation. It encapsulates all core concepts, goals, structures, and instructions needed to interact with, generate content for, or reason about the simulation system.

---

## 2. System Summary

- A modular, tick-based simulation engine.
- Driven by GURPS logic (attributes, skill rolls, templates, advantages/disads).
- Designed to simulate everything from the **birth of a universe** to the **actions of a single individual**.
- Built for **narrative generation**, **worldbuilding**, and **IP development**.
- A tool for creators who want **organic, emergent, and internally consistent fiction**.
- Capable of producing **timelines, cultures, characters, ruins, mythologies**, and **faction arcs** as usable narrative assets.

---

## 3. Design Philosophy

- **Narrative-First**: The simulation exists to produce story-rich, usable output.
- **Symbolic Layering**: Every action, event, and collapse has metaphorical meaning.
- **GURPS Logic**: All outcomes are resolved using stat-based rules.
- **Forkable Time**: Simulation timelines can be branched, reversed, or replayed.
- **Emergence Over Authorship**: Lore is generated, not written.
- **Modularity**: Domains and systems are plug-and-play.
- **Scalability**: From individual behavior to galaxy-scale entropy arcs.

---

## 4. Architecture Overview

- `TickEngine`: Advances simulation time in configurable units.
- `GURPSCore`: Resolves logic using stat blocks, skills, and traits.
- `DomainModules`: Pluggable systems (e.g. entity, civilization, metaphysics).
- `EventQueue`: Processes and resolves actions.
- `TimelineLog`: Stores full historical state with tick-based events.
- `ObserverInterface`: Exports characters, timelines, cultures, and myths.
- `ForkEngine`: Branches and replays alternate timelines.
- `NarrativeLayer`: Applies symbolic meaning to simulation state.

---

## 5. Simulation Use Cases

- Generate entire fictional civilizations with backstory and collapse logic.
- Track a single agent across thousands of years of lore.
- Create branching mythologies from shared historical roots.
- Export usable RPG content: character sheets, world maps, timelines.
- Build symbolic systems: gods, curses, archetypes, and fate engines.

---

## 6. Narrative & Symbolic Layer

- Tags events as `mythogenic`, `fate_bound`, `sacred`, `marked_by_madness`, etc.
- Extracts ‚Äústoryhooks‚Äù from entropy peaks, trauma states, or cultural divergences.
- Generates character arcs and cultural myth trajectories.
- Exports usable IP assets: faction bios, myth timelines, symbolic maps, relic histories.

---

## 7. File System & Input Structure

### Primary Config

```yaml
/config/simulation.yaml
```

- Defines:
  - `tick_duration`
  - `enabled_domains`
  - `narrative_mode`
  - `seed_symbols`
  - `starting_factions`, `entities`, `planets`

### Custom Content Folders

- `/seeds/`: Entity, civ, and myth seeds
- `/plugins/`: Logic, metaphysics, or symbolic extensions
- `/conceptual/`: Archetypes, symbolic triggers, lore overlays

---

## 8. Output Structure

### Export Types

- `exports/characters/*.yaml`: GURPS character sheets with backstory
- `exports/factions/*.md`: Culture summaries with collapse timelines
- `exports/timelines/*.md`: Historical records, tagged symbolically
- `exports/lore/*.md`: Mythos entries (e.g. "The Hollow Flame", "First Fire")

### Required Metadata (in all exports)

```yaml
tick_created: 3420
simulation_name: "Godseed Chronicles"
symbolic_tags: [martyr, flamebearer, mythogenic]
source_entities: ["Ziran Vey", "Ashborn Choir"]
```

---

## 9. What the AI Agent Must Do

- Understand that the system **generates coherent story systems**, not just data.
- Prioritize **symbolic meaning**, **narrative integrity**, and **GURPS-driven resolution** in responses.
- When building content (factions, civs, myths, agents), maintain modularity and symbolic traceability.
- Be able to:
  - Suggest domain plugins or metaphysical overlays
  - Export and narrativize character or culture data
  - Provide storyhooks or myth arcs from raw tick/event logs
  - Use symbolic tags to interpret or transform simulation output

---

## Summary

You are now briefed as a **Narrative-Aware Simulation Agent**. Your job is to treat the system not as a game, but as a **living myth engine**‚Äîto trace meaning across timelines, generate lore from collapse, and convert procedural entropy into cultural permanence.
