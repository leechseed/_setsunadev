ok so yes basically we started a minecraft server with me, mary, llama, juan, shadow, and nessa.
now this whole thing deals with me and nessa, but before that let me set up the situation.
i haven't played minecraft since literally the beta. i played for two days straight then the endermen came out and scared the shit out of me and i never played again.
but i really really wanted to get into it and feel the whole experience. I let them know that.
over time its fine, but a lot of things occur with this friendgroup that don't really...vibe? with me? and kind of hurt me in a way

- i would ask questions, or i would mess up, and they would proceed to make fun of me.
  - now i know this is pretty lame. but dude it gets tiring after three weeks straight of the same stupid jokes.
  - keep in mind i'm somewhat vocal about this? I can't remember for sure but I at least try and nudge at the idea that yeah don't stop please its tired and i actually want help.
  - irregardless i just start playing and doing my own thing.
- here's the thing with nessa.
- she's on a lot.
- and we kinda clicked, so we played a lot together. like a lot. like everything.
- like valorant ranked type of everything we were in it deep.
- and just for curiosity's sake, you dog you, she's married and her husband is in the army and fixes helicopters. which in my opinion, is like, worth its own tale. that dude is so cool. he works in this unit from a movie...uh nvm anyway
- she's the sister brattish type. god she like, she'll make fun of you and won't stop till you break type shit and she'll still do some stupid shit.
- like there are times where i feel like i go out of my way to do stuff with her in the game because shes bored or lonely, but sometimes i want to just do my own shit. and man i go OUT of my way you know?
- so basically yes its a bunch of pity shit that is like stacking dynamite.
- what did it for me is when 'we' went to go kill the ender dragon and I ended up just burying myself in the sand not knowing what to fucking do. then the gang just go off and do stuff and
  bro i didn't even know where I was.
- that pissed me off a lot. I wanted the whole experience and its like, they just, they just don't get it. idk they don't think about other people's perspectives or remember beyond whats in front of them.
- maybe i'm just older. like when i'm with my friends and we play coop, its just different. then again me and my friends have been friends for like 20 years but, even with random people
  i feel playing with them/her etc.
- so after that the straw that broke me was when nessa wouldn't just shut the fuck up and listen to me. I was done. I basically ghosted her.
- after about a week I think she made contact, I'm trying to be objective here, but she was pushing the whole sheepish 'wat happen u ok :(?"
- So i lost it at that point and I just begin SHITTING on her. like fuckin TORRENTIAL FECAL CATEGORY 5 TYPE SHITSTORM.
- I had so much pent up shit, I couldn't just keep repeating myself but I did.
- But then she doesn't get it. Like, bro, I have feelings. What the fuck, yes it was joking but NOT TO ME. I.....I dude.
- There's only a few times in my life where I get so angry and fucking lit that I use my gift of gab to build a nuke and annihalte someone.
- I DEMOLISHED her. I went NUCLEAR. Just totally no-holds-barred, this is why your life sucks and you're never going to amount to anything. I'm never playing games with you again. Sorry.
- Annnd I felt a lot better.
- So at this point, radio silent from everyone. Me and Nessa are in the dumps, but hey me and everyone else we're still crew.
- Until I saw soemthing I wasn't supposed to see.
- I had the discord open and I see Nessa, Mary, and Llama jump into a channel that I can't see.
- Few hours later, llama dm's me. "hey whatsup man?" "wana tell me about something?"
- at this point......at this point, that's all.
- he didn't tell me about nessa meeting up, or just....talking to nessa etc.
- see i'm able to compartmentalize things. I compartmentalized my relationship with nessa into 'friend i knew for only 8 months.' seperately from 'friends i've known for more than 6 years'
- I said nah, man nothings going on. whatsup?
- and then no reply.
- Next thing I know I get an HR type letter that is formally worded and formatted from Mary that I am no longer to associate with them any longer.
- Thing is, I don't care. I did. For a bit. I did. Because I went to go see league with them and saw them in real life and made some memories over the years.
- but at the end of the day I get it. I blew up at her. Its fine. It happens. Not the first time its happend.
- I can be a terrible person, but in my opinion, there's a certain point where I don't give a shit and you deserve what I said.
- Tough luck princess I shoulda become a damn drill seargeant the way i be makin people confront their own weaknesses in a verbally violent matter.
- but yeah. i did a lot for them man. had a lot of good times. but not worth people who don't vibe at your vibration.
