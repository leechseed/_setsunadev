## ðŸ§± Level 2: Work Packages

### 1. Initiation
- Project Charter
- Stakeholder Mapping
- Simulation Manifesto Finalization

### 2. Planning
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Buildout
- Timeline & Sprint Planning
- Risk Register Setup
- Dependency Map
- Output & Export Schema Draft

### 3. Execution
- Core Systems Development (TickEngine, GURPSCore, EventQueue)
- Domain Modules (Civilizations, Characters, Metaphysics)
- Plugin Framework (Loader, Archetypes, Mythogens)
- Symbolic Logic Layer
- Timeline Forking Engine
- Export System (YAML/Markdown)

### 4. Monitoring
- QA Symbolic System
- Regression Testing
