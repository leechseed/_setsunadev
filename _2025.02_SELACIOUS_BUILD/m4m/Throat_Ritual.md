# Astrological Fellatio Sloppy, Rough, Deep Throat Ritual Guide

Below is a **step-by-step ritual framework** that integrates **sloppy, rough, deep throat** elements into both a **20-minute “Default Ritual”** and a **40-minute “Devout Ritual.”** It combines astrological-themed ideas (e.g., cardinal orientations, zone-based stimulation) with more intense oral techniques (messy suction, firmer pace, deeper immersion).

## 1. Overview of Key Elements

1. **Sloppy Style**

   - Encourage extra saliva or incorporate body-safe lubrication.
   - Emphasize audible, wet contact—excess fluid is part of the experience.

2. **Rough Element**

   - Explore firmer suction or quicker rhythms.
   - Experiment with stronger lip pressure and rapid pulses.

3. **Deep Throat**
   - Align the neck and throat for deeper insertion.
   - Practice partial insertion before attempting fuller depth, creating a more immersive sensation.

## 2. 20-Minute Default Ritual

### **Segment 1 (0–5 minutes): Warm-Up & Sloppy Prep**

1. **Position & Contact**

   - Arrange the receiver comfortably (e.g., semi-reclined at bed’s edge).
   - Kneel or sit in a stable posture, ensuring easy forward/back movement.

2. **Sloppy Warm-Up**

   - Sip water or gently swirl saliva.
   - Use lips and tongue to coat the glans and shaft with moisture.
   - Build up a “messy” environment early on.

3. **Check Rhythm**
   - Begin with gentle lip encasing, minimal suction.
   - Keep momentum fluid, focusing on consistent lubrication.

### **Segment 2 (5–15 minutes): Rougher & Deeper Focus**

1. **Increasing Pace (3–5 min)**

   - Gradually intensify pressure: stronger lip grip, quicker pulses.
   - Encourage faster, firmer strokes or allow slight guided head movement from the receiver.

2. **Deep Throat Rounds (4–5 min)**

   - Align the throat and attempt partial descents, going deeper over time.
   - Inhale before lowering; exhale lightly while fully immersed for a smooth sensation.

3. **Sloppy Suction Transitions (2–3 min)**
   - Alternate between quick, noisy suction and deeper “holds.”
   - Let saliva drip or accumulate, intensifying the “wetness” factor.

### **Segment 3 (15–20 minutes): Closing & Wind-Down**

1. **Gradual Slowdown**

   - Ease back to milder suction or lip grazing along the shaft or scrotum.
   - Allow breathing and pace to return to a calmer state.

2. **Gentle Finish**
   - Close with softer, drawn-out strokes or kisses.
   - Towel off or wipe away extra saliva when done.

## 3. 40-Minute Devout Ritual

### **Segment 1 (0–5 minutes): Setup & Intention**

1. **Ambiance**

   - Light candles or set low lighting.
   - Prepare water, a towel, or optional lubricant for sloppy style.

2. **Astrological Visualization**
   - Reflect on the four cardinal points (top = MC, underside = IC, left = Asc, right = Desc) for varied approach angles.
   - Contemplate the major penis “zones” (shaft, glans, scrotum, frenulum) as fixed signs if desired.

### **Segment 2 (5–10 minutes): Sloppy Warm-Up & Alignment**

1. **Increased Saliva**

   - Drink water or swirl saliva to prime for messy contact.
   - Explore basic lip enveloping, letting fluid accumulate on the skin.

2. **Base Massage & Light Lip Work**
   - Combine hand contact at the base/scrotum with gentle mouth coverage along the shaft.
   - Remain aware of comfortable angles to prepare for deeper immersion.

### **Segment 3 (10–25 minutes): Extended Rough & Deep Throat Play**

1. **Building Momentum (5–7 min)**

   - Speed up lip motions, produce audible wet suction.
   - Alternate rhythmic pulses with strong lip pressure.

2. **Deeper Immersion (5–7 min)**

   - Attempt deeper throat descents, pausing briefly at the fullest point.
   - Continue exhaling gently as you lower the penis into the throat.

3. **Rougher Elements (3–5 min)**
   - Incorporate a faster, more forceful pace if desired.
   - Maintain a messy, dripping environment with saliva-lubricated friction.

### **Segment 4 (25–35 minutes): Variation & Experimental Angle**

1. **Angle Changes**

   - Shift from a front-facing approach to an underside or side entry.
   - Explore partial kneeling or lying back to find new vantage points.

2. **Tongue Interludes**
   - Insert quick, intense flicks or swirling around the glans/frenulum.
   - Return to rough suction or deeper holds to maintain momentum.

### **Segment 5 (35–40 minutes): Slower Finish**

1. **Easy Transition**

   - Move back to moderate suction and simple lip contact.
   - Let the rhythm ease down, diminishing any forceful motions.

2. **Final Moments**
   - Optional lingering mouth contact on the shaft or scrotum.
   - Warm cloth or water to cleanse any excess saliva.

## 4. Suggested Daily & Extended Practice

- **20-Minute Default**: A concise daily option with basic sloppy deep-throat components, letting you hone partial insertion and moderate “roughness.”
- **40-Minute Devout**: A weekly or special ritual dedicated to immersive, extended exploration of rough suction, deeper angles, and fluid-laden intensity.

**Performing with Other Partners** can add variety. Adapt speeds, angles, and depth approaches to each individual’s comfort and reaction. Each session can evolve based on mutual preference, exploring an ever-wider range of sloppy, rough, deep-throat possibilities within an astrological-themed oral practice.
