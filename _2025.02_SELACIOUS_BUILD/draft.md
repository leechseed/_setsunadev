This next phase is key. We zoom out and ask:

    What problem is this solving that no existing tool can solve?

    And what systems (software or manual workflows) have you already tried and found lacking?

Think through:

    Have you tried Notion, Airtable, World Anvil, game dev tools, RPG sim tools, AI tools?

    What do they fail to do?

    What makes your system necessary?

Answer with a clear list of tools/workflows youâ€™ve rejected or grown beyond. This will solidify your justification for building and sharpen scope.

Obsidian - proprietary paid software that doesn't have the extensibility of just using plain .md files in vscode

ChatGPT - great for generating data but not ideal for storing data and manipulation

Logseq - open source but unreliable development and support

VSCode - works well when writing, creating documentation, but when it comes to databasing, character creation, etc. I need something specialzied while this is good for general knowledge keeping

My system is necessary because without robust technological support, large IPs with robust quality will be unsustainable or improbable.
