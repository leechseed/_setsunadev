## 1. Overview

The Chimora are a frozen, glacial people of **sexual fluid economies and frozen restraint**. Milk, cum, and nectar are sacred resources—not erotic byproducts. They are harvested, stored, measured, and **controlled by caste and season**. To drip without sanction is to bleed coin. Their bodies are beautiful, pale, glistening vessels—but their hearts are cold. Sex is commerce. Temperature is law.

## 2. Sexual Paradigm

**Milking-Economy**: Sexual fluids are currency. Every drop is tracked, taxed, and categorized. Breeding potential, lactation output, and climax control are institutionalized. Erotic worth is defined not by pleasure—but by **yield, purity, and containment.**

## 3. Cultural Roots

Inspired by **Norse, Finnish, and Inuit arctic survival cultures**, fused with dystopian biotech logic. Chimora rituals mimic milkmaid traditions, glacial funeral rites, and hyper-controlled resource management. Their society is **orgasmic capitalism frozen in snow.**

## 4. Dominant Factions

### 4.1 The Ice Bankers _(Fluid Control Bureaucracy)_

- **Philosophy**: Fluids are sacred. Uncontrolled emission is heresy. All bodies must be governed like reservoirs.

#### Male Sect: _The Frostborn Drains_

- Surgically fitted with emission valves and semen meters. Known for their cold speech, passive edging, and blue-veined chests. Forbidden to climax outside quarterly release schedules.

#### Female Sect: _The Veinlock Matrons_

- Breastmilk officers trained in restraint and administration. Their milk is purified via coldfasting and sold in tinctures. Known for emotionless nursing rituals and chilling thigh pressure.

### 4.2 The Wetwilders _(Anarchic Fluid Liberators)_

- **Philosophy**: The body is not a vault—it is a river. They fuck in snowstorms and melt their rules with passion.

#### Male Sect: _The Spillcallers_

- Cumming in public is prayer. They milk themselves with icicle rods and worship breath-fog sex. Known for full-body tremor orgasms.

#### Female Sect: _The Thawbloods_

- Lactating shamans who squirt milk into open air as protest. Known for nipple rings shaped like snowflakes and reverse-frostbirth rites involving steam-drenched gangbangs.

## 5. Roles of Non-Male/Female Identities

- **Femboys**: _Crystal Cups_—trained in oral fluid extraction and ceremonial edging. Often used to "prime" drains before scheduled emissions.
- **Robot/Synthetic**: _Vaultskins_—mechanical bodies with internal reservoirs, used to archive and chill sexual fluids until redistribution.
- **Non-Sexed**: _Zeroes_—assigned as neutral regulators. Serve as orgasm accountants, supply chain auditors, or cold-room monks.

## 6. Rituals and Achievements

- **Quartermilk Trials**: Produce a full quota of semen or breastmilk under extreme cold stress while bound.
- **Frostbirth Ceremonies**: Orgies held in subzero chambers where climax creates communal heat to thaw a ritual partner.
- **Dripfast Edging**: Weeks of edging under freezing temperatures. The final ejaculation is flash-frozen and displayed in civic halls.
- **Snowdrain Feasts**: Fluids poured on hot stones, inhaled as steam by the crowd to “consume without contact.”

## 7. Taboos and Conflicts

- Ice Bankers forbid unscheduled orgasms—leaking fluid is punished by genital cryobonding.
- Wetwilders mock synthetic tracking devices and spike their fluid with stimulants to trigger overflow.
- Crystal Cups who refuse their extraction duties are ritually shaved and displayed in public as “dry frauds.”

## 8. Cross-Racial Relations

- Feared by the **Graviki**, who see them as sexless manipulators.
- Envied by the **Draveth**, who covet their purity-focused data streams.
- Loathed by the **Sephara**, who call them emotionally sterilized and “the unmoaned.”
