## 1. Overview

The Zvetral are a cold-climate people of psychic repression and erotic tension, forged in ice and burdened by silence. Their society holds chastity as a **weapon of social dominance**, and denial is not just a value—it is a currency of spirit. Whether bound by the rigid rites of the Orthodox Veil or awakened in the fever-rites of the Bloom, Zvetral seek to conquer lust by owning it. **They don't fuck for release—they fuck to imprison.**

## 2. Sexual Paradigm

**Restraint-Purist**: Power lies in **what you do not do**. Erotic control, delayed gratification, sexual edge endurance, and ritual denial are the ultimate status markers. Purity is weaponized. Virginity can be absolute or theatrical—but it's always meaningful.

## 3. Cultural Roots

Drawn from **Eastern European, Slavic, and Balkan traditions**, particularly those of Orthodox monasticism, forest witchcraft, and folk virgin-bride archetypes. Blending Orthodox sexual repression with pagan body-rites and communal edge theater.

## 4. Dominant Factions

### 4.1 The Orthodox Veil _(Chastity Ritualists)_

- **Philosophy**: The body must be encased in rules, girded by silence. Sexuality is not evil—it is **volatile**, and must be sealed behind rites of steel.

#### Male Sect: _The Oathbound_

- Genital cages are worn from puberty. Training includes eye contact suppression, semen retention, and erotic denial chants in underground stone chambers. Forbidden to touch others unless sanctioned by clergy-mothers.

#### Female Sect: _The Whitecoil Brides_

- Sworn to the Womb Vow. Their bodies are wrapped daily in tight bindings soaked in snow water. Known for ceremonial edge-cycles that last days and are publicly scored without climax.

### 4.2 The Balkan Bloom _(Pagan Reclaimers)_

- **Philosophy**: What the church represses, the forest exalts. Bloom practitioners weaponize virgin tropes by turning them into aggressive rites of heat, dirt, and controlled collapse.

#### Male Sect: _The Rootkings_

- Edge-ritual warriors who chase orgasm in circles—tied to trees, denied release until their mind fractures into the earth. Masters of tease-rituals involving food, dirt, and whispered mother-words.

#### Female Sect: _The Bloomtorn_

- Forest-bound witch brides who simulate purity before unleashing violently erotic fertility rites. Known for vaginal edging while reciting ancestral curse-poetry. Gaping forbidden until moon turns red.

## 5. Roles of Non-Male/Female Identities

- **Femboys**: _Snowmaids_—used as living chastity objects in public edge-feasts. The Orthodox parade them untouched; the Bloom corrupt them slowly across seasonal cycles.
- **Robot/Synthetic**: _Stonekeepers_—automated arousal-monitors. Administer denial schedules, track edge-tremble metrics, and simulate sexual restraint for punishment or display.
- **Non-Sexed**: _Icebound_—those who have frozen their sexuality entirely, ritually sealing their genitals and emotions alike. Serve as priest-judges or living statues of eternal restraint.

## 6. Rituals and Achievements

- **Chillfast Trials**: Public edging in snow pits, performed nude but with full vow-silence.
- **Womblock Ceremony**: Vulva sealing with ornate, time-locked devices. Release only authorized on blood anniversaries.
- **Gaspwall Hymns**: Public denial moaning as chorus while bound in silence rings. Those who climax are immediately expelled or reprocessed.
- **Virgin Combat**: Duels between unbroken warriors; winner is denied orgasm the longest. Loser must confess dreams aloud.

## 7. Taboos and Conflicts

- The Orthodox Veil forbids climax outside sanctioned Holy Rites. Breaking a vow results in being branded “Cleft.”
- The Bloomtorn mock any who maintain chastity past their second winter. They force-feed taboo fantasies to Orthodox defectors.
- Snowmaids who choose one side are often dismembered ritually—reborn if they survive the pain in silence.

## 8. Cross-Racial Relations

- Feared by the **Kheprax**, who sense their quiet edge as a parallel weapon to degradation.
- Mocked by the **Aphrisari**, who view their restraint as self-castration.
- Secretly respected by the **Tsanai**, who admire their disciplined erotic architecture and emotional violence.
