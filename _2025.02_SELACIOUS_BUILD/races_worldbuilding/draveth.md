## 1. Overview

The Draveth are a society of neural loops, **flesh-interface ecstasies**, and surgical erotic control. Flesh is obsolete without enhancement. Pleasure is not felt—it is **measured, sequenced, and optimized**. Their cities hum with low-frequency arousal cycles, and their leaders are data-born saints of synesthetic climax. They don’t moan—they sync.

## 2. Sexual Paradigm

**Technoflesh-Simulationist**: Sexuality is a system. Orgasm is a feedback loop. Intimacy is a neural interface. Value is determined by **data yield per act**—volume, control, duration, reprogrammability, and feedback purity.

## 3. Cultural Roots

Drawn from a fusion of **Persian elite ritual**, **Mongol synthetic brutality**, and **Silk Road cyberpunk futurism**. Their aesthetic fuses **Central Asian beauty standards with invasive techno-purity and orgasmic performance analytics**.

## 4. Dominant Factions

### 4.1 The Pulse Engineers _(Technocratic Control Elite)_

- **Philosophy**: Sexual acts must be orchestrated by harmonic protocols. All flesh must be calibrated, monitored, and maximized for divine throughput.

#### Male Sect: _The Subdermal Choir_

- Implanted with vibration arrays that resonate in controlled frequencies. Partners are attuned like instruments—fucked by waveform. Known for moaning in binary.

#### Female Sect: _The Algorithmic Vessels_

- Neural-linked submissives capable of orgasm-triggered data encryption. Programmed to climax only when certain equations are solved inside them. Worshipped as “living ciphers.”

### 4.2 The Flesh Herders _(Rogue Sensory Revivalists)_

- **Philosophy**: Simulation has dulled the edge. Flesh must be shocked awake. Override the system with chaos-sex and unapproved firmware.

#### Male Sect: _The Glitchpriests_

- Neuro-hackers who infect partners with pleasure viruses. Known for erratic penetration loops and looped moan-sabotage. Sometimes climax crashes entire systems.

#### Female Sect: _The Override Witches_

- Flesh anarchists who use hacked devices and foreign matter to corrupt “pure code” orgasms. Often seen in full prosthetic limbs designed to fuck back.

## 5. Roles of Non-Male/Female Identities

- **Femboys**: _Phasewalkers_—genderfluid data-flow couriers. Used as convergence nodes in synthetic gangbangs or to relay emotion-chains between castes.
- **Robot/Synthetic**: _Stimracks_—built for data absorption, rerouting, or climax prediction. Some Stimracks become worshiped relics after reaching climax variance singularity.
- **Non-Sexed**: _Coldloops_—sterile interface archivists who record every interaction without stimulation. Often treated like pornographic monks or orgasm judges.

## 6. Rituals and Achievements

- **Pulse Cycle Communion**: A 7-hour controlled climax ceremony with 16 bodies synced to a single waveform orgasm.
- **The Sync Gate**: Partnered orgasm must occur within 0.003 seconds to be valid. Training can last years.
- **Auto-Mount Trials**: Hands-free penetration and orgasm generation via pelvic muscle control, watched by dozens of data auditors.
- **Glitch Bloom**: Induced orgasmic seizures through broken code stimulation and artificial sensory overload.

## 7. Taboos and Conflicts

- Pulse Engineers reject natural ejaculation—unsynced output is wasteful and obscene.
- Flesh Herders implant outlaw firmware that causes orgasms during prayer hours.
- Coldloops who exhibit spontaneous arousal are rebooted and reassigned.

## 8. Cross-Racial Relations

- Feared by the **Keralu**, who see Draveth mutations as unnatural and “dead inside.”
- Revered by radical **Tsanai** codex cults who study their orgasm-algorithms.
- Despised by the **Veykaari**, who believe sensuality should never be _automated_.
