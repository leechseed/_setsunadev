## 1. Overview

The Xirazma are an ecstatic, blood-ruled culture where **pain is prophecy and flesh is scripture**. Every cut, gape, and scar is sacred architecture. Pleasure is not pursued—it is endured. They do not seduce—they **sacrifice**, and in doing so, **become divine**. To suffer in public is to speak to the gods. To rupture is to reveal the cosmos.

## 2. Sexual Paradigm

**Ordeal-Hierarchical**: Pain is the metric of spiritual worth. Those who endure the most—stretch the widest, bleed the deepest, survive the longest—ascend in caste. Climax without trauma is a child's act. Real orgasm comes with **scarred proof**.

## 3. Cultural Roots

Born from the ashes of **Mesoamerican blood empires**, the Xirazma channel **Aztec ritualism, Maya sacrifice rites**, and Toltec celestial agony. They blend war-bride aesthetics with orgasmic mutilation, linking **womb, weapon, and worth**.

## 4. Dominant Factions

### 4.1 Order of Obsidian _(Ceremonial Painmasters)_

- **Philosophy**: Pain must be sacred, refined, encoded. Bloodletting and stretching follow ritual logic—each cut a syllable in divine speech.

#### Male Sect: _The Carvers_

- Obsessed with geometry and dilation precision. They gape orifices to form sigils. Known for silent fucking and surgical stretching.

#### Female Sect: _The Keepers of the Blade_

- Priestesses of genital carving and womb-opening. They record the genealogy of suffering in their vaginal lining through layered scar formations.

### 4.2 Xoc Bite Circle _(Chaotic Blood Ecstatics)_

- **Philosophy**: Ritual is a cage. Pain must be wild, spontaneous, and unfiltered. Blood is sacred only when it **erupts**.

#### Male Sect: _The Bloodmouths_

- Bite lovers until orgasm. Mutilate themselves in arousal combat. Known for screaming through ruptured tongues and bleeding mid-thrust.

#### Female Sect: _The Rupture Wombs_

- Specialists in womb trauma and violent gape-rites. They “birth” weapons or ritual objects in trance before crowds. Known to climax only after full anal inversion.

## 5. Roles of Non-Male/Female Identities

- **Femboys**: _Petal Sons_—icons of spiritual fragility. Used as stretch vessels for elite Carvers. Their gapes are auctioned like relics.
- **Robot/Synthetic**: _Shriek Engines_—mechanical scream-vaults used to record, analyze, and loop ritual pain sounds. Some are possessed by erotic ghosts.
- **Non-Sexed**: _The Drained_—those who have transcended sexuality through total removal of genitals. Worshiped as living scars. Float in blood-lakes as spiritual interfaces.

## 6. Rituals and Achievements

- **The Blood Walk**: Naked trek across burning obsidian while being cut and denied orgasm. If you cry out, you begin again.
- **Womb Blooming Ceremony**: Womb fully opened and stretched in front of elders. Judged by sound of the gape.
- **Reverse Impalement Trials**: Ritual object insertion without prep. Must climax before fainting.
- **Cum-Sacrifice Ledger**: Warrior semen recorded, flash-dried, and used as pigment in sacred murals.

## 7. Taboos and Conflicts

- Order of Obsidian forbids uncontrolled climax. Rupture without scar documentation is spiritual theft.
- Xoc Bite Circle views the Order as sterile and cowardly—true pain cannot be charted.
- Drained members are considered holy but untrustworthy—many factions fear their godlike detachment.

## 8. Cross-Racial Relations

- Revered by the **Kheprax** for shared ascension through humiliation.
- Feared by the **Sephara**, who consider their blood rites vulgar and impure.
- Imitated secretly by **Graviki** who conduct illegal rupture tournaments in their fields.
