## 1. Overview

The Palluma are a luminous, metamorphic people whose entire culture is based on **change through sexual contact**. Fluids are not just messengers—they are catalysts. With each partner, each act, their bodies and identities shift. Their sexual paradigm is one of perpetual rebirth, ecstatic mutation, and divine confusion. Beauty is measured by how _far_ one can become from who they were.

## 2. Sexual Paradigm

**Transformational Erotic**: The sex act changes the body and soul. Penetration alters physiology. Semen, saliva, and vaginal nectar contain mutagenic spirit codes. Identity is fluid, literally and sexually.

## 3. Cultural Roots

Heavily inspired by **Amazonian, Quechua, Shipibo, and Tupi spiritual traditions**, especially shamanic rites involving ayahuasca, animal totems, spirit-sex, and the belief that gender and identity can fluctuate through spiritual contact. Their culture blends mystical naturalism with hardcore body-altering kink.

## 4. Dominant Factions

### 4.1 The Skyvine Shamans _(Lineage-Bound Vision Keepers)_

- **Philosophy**: Mutation must be guided. Change is sacred only when shepherded through trance, rhythm, and shamanic control.

#### Male Sect: _The Flightbearers_

- Men who grow feathers or wings through erotic chanting and mushroom-fueled moan states. Known for avian genital grafts and cloaca-based penetration rituals.

#### Female Sect: _The Bloommothers_

- Fertility witches who swell with plant-life and birth symbiotic creatures after orgies. Their gaping is pollinated by ritual sex and their vaginal canal evolves with each session.

### 4.2 The Bloom-Eaters _(Feral Mutation Cult)_

- **Philosophy**: Stop guiding change—_become it_. Mutation is divine when wild. Reject control, embrace erotic chaos.

#### Male Sect: _The Pollenlords_

- Toxin-seeders who fuck to infect. Their semen contains spore libraries that force physical and behavioral change in partners. Often mutated themselves beyond easy recognition.

#### Female Sect: _The Shedding Daughters_

- Hyper-evolving perverts who abandon names, skins, and shapes. Use extreme dilation and seed ingestion to absorb traits of every partner they “eat.” Some no longer speak in human language.

## 5. Roles of Non-Male/Female Identities

- **Femboys**: Known as _Flutterlings_—transitionary beings seen as divine bridges between form. Used in first-rite transformation ceremonies. Often grow tails, wings, or other symbolic mutations.
- **Robot/Synthetic**: _Splicebodies_—cybernetic clay constructs that archive sexual mutations. Used to test hybrid penetrative rituals and house volatile spirit codes.
- **Non-Sexed**: _The Forgotten Forms_—completely fluid or post-sexual entities. No longer considered of gender or body. Sometimes dissolve into orgy-m
