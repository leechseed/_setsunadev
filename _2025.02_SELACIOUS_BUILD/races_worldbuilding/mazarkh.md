## 1. Overview

The Mazarkh are a sun-scorched desert race who live by the laws of exposure, silence, and erotic control. **To be seen is to be sacred.** Their bodies are temples of denial and revelation. Veils are not modesty—they are power. Public sexual display is spiritual discipline, and every act is bound by ritual, timing, and sacred heat. They are born under fire and unveiled under judgment.

## 2. Sexual Paradigm

**Exhibitionist-Sacral**: Visibility is virtue. Erotic power comes from how, when, and where one unveils the body—not simply to be gazed at, but to **wield nudity as invocation**. Control over exposure is control over fate.

## 3. Cultural Roots

Drawn from **Arabian Peninsula, Berber/Maghreb, and pre-Islamic Middle Eastern cultures**, with emphasis on erotic veiling, poetic dominance, and heat-based spiritual metaphysics. Echoes of **perfume codes, shadow play, and trance-based performance** define their core.

## 4. Dominant Factions

### 4.1 The Kohl-Marked _(Orthodox Masters of Erotic Restraint)_

- **Philosophy**: Erotic power lies in the _suggestion_. The slow unveiling of flesh is a sacred liturgy. Silence, denial, and gaze control are divine crafts.

#### Male Sect: _The Sighbearers_

- Trained in stillness, breath-tempo, and pheromone projection. Often remain fully clothed but dominate with scent trails and eye contact alone.

#### Female Sect: _The Veilwives_

- Masters of erotic shrouding, body language, and ritualized partial nudity. Control crowds and partners by never revealing too much at once.

### 4.2 The Sandglass Cult _(Exhibitionist Extremists of Divine Rupture)_

- **Philosophy**: True holiness lies in the full, brutal revelation of the body under sun and sky. Shame is the last mask of weakness.

#### Male Sect: _The Thornsons_

- Scarified performers who masturbate publicly until bleeding. Known for orgasm-denial marathons and ritualized desert gaping.

#### Female Sect: _The Open Suns_

- Skin-bleached nymphs who reveal themselves under peak heat as a test of divine favor. Known for full-body tanning orgies and public penetration rites at midday.

## 5. Roles of Non-Male/Female Identities

- **Femboys**: _Mirrorlings_—trained in mimicry and teasing, they are often used in multi-viewer rituals where audience attention alters their form mid-exhibition.
- **Robot/Synthetic**: _Glintframes_—machines designed with ultra-polished chrome bodies used to reflect and refract live nudity in sacred light geometries.
- **Non-Sexed**: _The Obscured_—figures who wear full-body black veils and command erotic power through permanent concealment. Considered living mysteries, often worshiped by both factions.

## 6. Rituals and Achievements

- **Unveiling Rite**: A slow reveal over 30 days of fasting, sweat-control, and silent teasing before a public audience.
- **Eclipse Gaping**: Timed anal/vaginal display at the exact moment of eclipse climax—meant to mirror cosmic unveiling.
- **Perfume Duel**: Competing through arousal-scent layering until the crowd loses composure.
- **Scald Trials**: Sexual acts performed on sand-heated stones to prove devotion through burning flesh.

## 7. Taboos and Conflicts

- The Kohl-Marked forbid full nudity outside temples—breaking this rule without ritual leads to tattoo exile.
- The Sandglass Cult view veils as hypocrisy; they seek to permanently mark their bodies through sun damage and exhibition trauma.
- Mirrorlings who refuse audience-based control can be forcibly restaged in reflection-chambers as punishment.

## 8. Cross-Racial Relations

- Respected by the **Tsanai** for their control and visual sophistication.
- Pitied by the **Aphrisari**, who believe restraint is the enemy of pleasure.
- Envy-fetishized by the **Veykaari**, who crave their sun rituals but lack the capacity for raw heat endurance.
