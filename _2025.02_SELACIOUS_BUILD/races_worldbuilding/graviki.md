## 1. Overview

The Graviki are a brutal, agrarian race built on sacred fertility and relentless physical labor. Their entire culture revolves around **breeding, bodily capacity, and earthbound sexual rites**. The Graviki body is treated as both **plow and soil**—flesh is to be stretched, planted, and harvested. The more fecund, thick, and gaped you are, the more respected you become.

## 2. Sexual Paradigm

**Breeding-Ordeal Hybrid**: The Graviki value **impregnation, gape capacity, endurance-based plowing, and repeated penetration cycles**. It’s not just about sex—it’s about yield. Breeding potential and sexual stamina are the twin pillars of worth.

## 3. Cultural Roots

Inspired by **Celtic, Germanic, Anglo-Saxon paganism and rural European fertility cults**. From Beltane fire-fucking to Freyja’s plow-blessing, Graviki myth sees **sex as agriculture** and the body as divine earth to be split and seeded.

## 4. Dominant Factions

### 4.1 The Seedwrights _(Orthodox Fertility Cult)_

- **Philosophy**: Sex is sacred duty; every orgasm must fertilize. Gaping and fucking must be seasonal and symbolic. Children are divine proof of worth.

#### Male Sect: _The Horned Fathers_

- Hulking inseminators, known for virility displays and ritualized breeding duels. Wear horns to signify impregnation count.

#### Female Sect: _The Milkfolk_

- Matrons of endless breastmilk flow, trained in gape-retention for optimal seed uptake. Lactation is both prayer and proof of utility.

### 4.2 The Red Root Circle _(Radical Dirt-Witch Sect)_

- **Philosophy**: The earth takes what it wants. Sex is feral, dirty, and violent. Breeding is a power exchange, not a holy act.

#### Male Sect: _The Muckborn_

- Mud-soaked sex gladiators who rut in plow fields before dawn. Known for beastlike thrust styles and “plow goring” contests.

#### Female Sect: _The Underwives_

- Earth priestesses who gape to summon spirits. They specialize in anal dilation as communion, and carry dirt in their wombs as sacrament.

## 5. Roles of Non-Male/Female Identities

- **Femboys**: Called _Cropboys_—used in gape inspections and fertility forecasting. Rewarded for their softness and used as live barometers of seasonal fuckflow.
- **Robot/Synthetic**: _Auto-Breeders_—used to simulate endless seed cycles and measure field-readiness. Worshiped for their limitless capacity.
- **Non-Sexed**: _Threshers_—ascetics who guide breeding math, manage orgasm quotas, and record penetration logs in sacred runes.

## 6. Rituals and Achievements

- **Field Plowing Orgies**: Entire villages rutted in lines to simulate harvest rows.
- **Gapewide Contests**: Gape measured against ceremonial plow blade widths.
- **Milking Tournaments**: Breastmilk quantities poured into sacred stone troughs.
- **Seed-Tally Rites**: Daily cum counts recorded for lineage scrolls.

## 7. Taboos and Conflicts

- The Seedwrights forbid sex outside seasonal rites—fucking without a fertility calendar is considered blasphemous.
- The Red Root Circle rejects fertility hierarchy and focuses on emotional destruction during sex.
- Cropboys caught engaging in dry orgasm play are punished by denial ordeals.

## 8. Cross-Racial Relations

- Loved by **Aphrisari** for their stamina and celebratory fucking style.
- Feared by **Tsanai**, who call them “The Shit-Priests of Gape.”
- Respected secretly by **Mazaani**, who admire their use of sexual performance for communal coherence.
