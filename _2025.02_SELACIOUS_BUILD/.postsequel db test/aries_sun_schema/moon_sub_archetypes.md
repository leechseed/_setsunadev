# üåô Documentation: Model Integration for Moon Sign Archetypes

## üß† Objective

To structurally classify and generate emotionally driven archetypes for each Moon sign using distinct, domain-specific triadic models. Unlike the Sun, which governs ego and identity, the Moon is the seat of instinct, emotional regulation, memory, and attachment. Each section of the Moon Sign Archetype Template corresponds to a different psychological or relational dynamic.

Rather than flattening the emotional profile with a one-size-fits-all approach, this framework applies the best-fit triadic models to each Moon section based on its **function**.

## üåô Moon Sign Archetype Template Overview

1. Zodiac_Profile _(metadata only)_
2. Emotional Identity
3. Emotional Patterning
4. Relational Dynamics
5. Emotional Drive
6. Inner World Expression

Each of sections 2‚Äì6 is paired with a specific triadic model to express a full emotional spectrum, ranging from instinct to intimacy to inner narration.

| Template Section         | Applied Model                        | Model Description                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Emotional Identity`     | Jungian Child Archetypes             | Core emotional role and security orientation                              |
| `Emotional Patterning`   | Defense/Coping Style Typology        | Models emotional reactivity, pattern response, and affect regulation      |
| `Relational Dynamics`    | Attachment Theory (Bowlby/Ainsworth) | Defines bonding style, intimacy needs, and vulnerability mechanisms       |
| `Emotional Drive`        | Inner Hunger / Trauma Mapping        | Unconscious emotional motivation and avoidance structure                  |
| `Inner World Expression` | Memory & Narrative Imprint Theory    | Captures story-of-self, memory bias, and creative-emotional transmutation |

## üîç Justification of Model Pairings

### 1. Jungian Child Archetypes ‚Üí **Emotional Identity**

- Emotional identity originates in **subconscious protection strategies** and idealized relational roles (e.g., Wounded Child, Magical Child, Orphan).

### 2. Defense/Coping Typology ‚Üí **Emotional Patterning**

- Focuses on **how emotional responses are triggered, processed, and coped with**.
- Tracks instinctual behavior via fight/flight/freeze/fawn + learned coping schemas.

### 3. Attachment Theory ‚Üí **Relational Dynamics**

- Moon governs bonding. Attachment theory offers clear relational styles (Secure, Anxious, Avoidant, Disorganized) and what impairs trust, safety, intimacy.

### 4. Trauma/Hunger Mapping ‚Üí **Emotional Drive**

- Uses frameworks from trauma therapy and developmental psychology to map **core needs** and the **avoidant systems** that emerge when those needs are unmet.

### 5. Memory & Narrative Theory ‚Üí **Inner World Expression**

- Moon signs store **subjective reality**, and this section maps **emotional storylines**, **internalized scripts**, and creative transmutation (√† la mythopoetic psychology).

## üß± Application Notes

- Each Moon Sign receives **three archetypes per section** based on the associated model.
- This structure is ideal for:
  - Relationship modeling
  - Emotional simulation
  - Subconscious character construction
  - Psychological narrative engines

## üß™ Example: Aries_Moon (in progress)

**Emotional Identity (Jungian Child)**: Wounded Child / Hero Child / Rejected Child  
**Emotional Patterning (Defense Typology)**: Explode / Suppress / Attack-then-withdraw  
**Relational Dynamics (Attachment)**: Anxious / Disorganized / Secure-ish  
**Emotional Drive (Hunger Mapping)**: Protection / Validation / Dominance  
**Inner World Expression (Memory Theory)**: "I fight to survive" / "I can‚Äôt be weak" / "If I‚Äôm not strong, I‚Äôm nothing"

## ‚úÖ Status

- Model mapping complete for all Moon template categories
- Aries_Moon draft underway
- Documentation approved for expansion to all 12 Moon signs
