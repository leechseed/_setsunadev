Perfect‚Äîthanks for the clarification. You‚Äôre saying:

- **‚ÄúVigor Veil‚Äù** is not _one archetype among many_‚Äîit‚Äôs a **core component** of the character‚Äôs **narrative profile**.
- It functions like the **Ascendant**, meaning it governs how the character **interfaces with the world**, **reacts under pressure**, and **appears to others.**
- Therefore, its schema must be **clean, high-level, and consistent** with the format used for `Sun_Core` and `Moon_Core`.

Here‚Äôs the revised version:

This aligns 1:1 with your Sun and Moon schemas:

- `Sun_Core` = Identity + Will

- `Vigor_Veil` = Interface + Adaptation

Let me know if you want **Aries_Vigor_Veil** filled in next.

# üìÑ SEXUAL PRESENCE MODULE ‚Äî CHARACTER DATABASE EXPANSION

**Date:** "2025-05-19"  
**Prepared by:** Narrative Systems Division  
**Project:** GUTS99 / Narrative Chemistry Engine  
**Module:** `sexual_presence`  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## üîß PURPOSE

This module defines the **sexual aura, aesthetic signaling, and fetish logic** of a character in both **simulationist** (GURPS-compatible) and **narrative** contexts. It integrates kink theory, visual trope modeling, and modular world logic to support seduction, reputation, social dynamics, and aesthetic-coding systems across narrative systems.

---

## üß† OBJECTIVE

To model characters not just by raw attractiveness, but by:

- **Erotic power projection**
- **Symbolic archetyping**
- **Aesthetic presentation**
- **Fetish and kink signaling**
- **Interactional chemistry and social response**

This enables deeper compatibility for:

- Procedural seduction events
- Faction-based sexual norms and taboos
- Narrative pacing around intimacy and taboo
- Character arcs involving repression, exhibitionism, shame, or divine sexuality

## üß¨ DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

- **GURPS-Compatible**: Tied into Charisma, Appearance, Reputation, and Reaction mechanics.
- **Narrative-Centric**: Enables symbolic, archetypal, or taboo-inflected storytelling.
- **Modular**: Every field is string-tag and JSON-ready for fast integration.
- **World-Linked**: Integrates into faction-based reputational logic for systemic simulation.
- **Kink-Informed**: Leverages real fetish structures for emergent storytelling and consent modeling.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Create `fetish_taxonomy` lookup table with canonical fetish tags and domains.
- [ ] Define `aesthetic_coding` registry with linked visuals, tags, and cultural associations.
- [ ] Integrate this schema with `scene_engine` to influence intimacy encounters and NPC behavior.
- [ ] Link to `chemistry_matrix` for pairwise compatibility and attraction simulation.
- [ ] Build automated `sexual_presence_template.md` frontmatter generator for YAML character notes.
