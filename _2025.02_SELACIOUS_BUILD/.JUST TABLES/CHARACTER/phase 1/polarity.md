### ‚ö° What Is **Polarity** in Astrology?

**Polarity** is one of the **core classification systems** in astrology. It refers to the **energetic orientation** of a zodiac sign‚Äîhow that sign **projects or receives energy**.

It's **binary**:

- Either **Positive (Masculine)**
- Or **Negative (Feminine)**

But those labels are symbolic, not gendered in a literal sense. Think **Yin vs. Yang** in Taoism: a dynamic duality of expression.

## ‚úÖ Practical Application in Databases

You could break `polarities` into two linked tables:

### `polarities`

```sql
CREATE TABLE polarities (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,             -- 'Positive' or 'Negative'
    archetype TEXT NOT NULL,               -- 'Masculine' or 'Feminine'
    energy_type TEXT NOT NULL,             -- 'Yang' or 'Yin'
    expression_direction TEXT,             -- 'Outward' or 'Inward'
    mode_of_engagement TEXT                -- 'Active, assertive' etc.
);
```

### `polarity_signs`

```sql
CREATE TABLE polarity_signs (
    polarity_id INTEGER REFERENCES polarities(id),
    sign_name TEXT NOT NULL                -- e.g. 'Aries'
);
```

---

## TL;DR

- **Polarity** = energetic type: outward vs. inward.
- **Positive/Masculine** = active, assertive, expressive.
- **Negative/Feminine** = receptive, introspective, emotional.
- It can absolutely be broken into `Name`, `Archetype`, `Energy_Type`, etc.
- This is not about biological gender‚Äîit‚Äôs about **how energy moves and behaves**.

Want me to generate the SQL seed data for both polarities in this broken-down format?
