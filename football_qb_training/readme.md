# üìò Documentation Report: Core Texts for Quarterback Training

**Section**: Seminal References & Knowledgebase
**Project**: QB Solo Development
**Studio**: GUTS99
**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Prepared by**: Narrative Chemistry Engine

---

## üéØ Objective

To compile a concise, actionable summary of the most influential and widely used reference texts for quarterback mechanics, mental game, and physical preparation. This document serves as the definitive starting point for serious solo QB development or for coaches designing private programs.

---

## üß≠ Methodological Overview

### **Primary Goal**

Identify, sequence, and contextualize the most essential texts that professional and collegiate QB coaches keep as reference material, ensuring clarity in what each book offers and how it maps to practical training.

---

## üìê Framework Used

### **Summ Template Structure**

- Distills each text into key chapters and focus areas.
- Provides recommended reading sequence for skill progression.
- Maps each text directly to mechanics, mental preparation, and physical conditioning.
- Ensures coaches and self-training athletes understand each book‚Äôs contribution at a glance.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Strategies Employed

### **1. Source Prioritization**

Selected texts universally cited or widely used in elite-level QB development (Slack, House, Read, AFCA). Avoided diluted "general football" manuals.

---

### **2. Sequential Learning Design**

Structured recommended reading order to match natural QB learning progression:

- Mechanics ‚Üí Motion health ‚Üí Mental game ‚Üí Advanced drills ‚Üí Physical foundation.

---

### **3. Skill Mapping**

Mapped each text to specific domains (mechanics, mental, physical) for integrated program design.

---

### **4. Simplified Knowledgebase Formatting**

Presented content as a digestible knowledgebase to avoid information overload.

## üß© Integration with Themes

The knowledgebase supports the thematic idea that **mechanics are the root of all QB development**, with mental game as the next critical layer and physical preparation as the necessary foundation for durability and power.

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome

- A fully sequenced, mapped reading framework ready for immediate implementation in QB personal development or coaching curriculum.
- Clear alignment of each resource to training domains.
- Supports efficient program design without guesswork.

---

## üèÅ Next Step

- Optionally develop a **20-week solo QB training program** based on this text sequence, integrating drills, weekly study goals, and progressive milestones.
- Create an accompanying spreadsheet or digital vault (Notion/Obsidian) to track reading, drills, and personal metrics.
