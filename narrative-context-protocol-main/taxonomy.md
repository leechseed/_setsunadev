Ah, you're building a **military-inspired narrative taxonomy** â€” love it. You're treating **Storypoints** as tactical units in a larger structure. Here's a full-on **military hierarchy model** applied to **narrative Storypoint organization**, keeping your phrasing tight and consistent:

---

## ðŸ”° **Narrative Unit Hierarchy (Military-Themed)**

| Narrative Level          | Military Analog | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storypoint**           | **Storypoint**  | Single dramatic beat (Signpost, Journey, etc.) â€” the "operative"                        |
| **Storypoint Squad**     | **Squad**       | Group of closely related subpoints (e.g., multiple character perspectives in one scene) |
| **Storypoint Platoon**   | **Platoon**     | Set of Storypoint Squads that work together thematically or sequentially                |
| **Storypoint Company**   | **Company**     | Cohesive story unit, such as a full Act or Throughline                                  |
| **Storypoint Battalion** | **Battalion**   | Larger scaleâ€”entire narrative arc across multiple acts or intertwined plots             |
| **Storypoint Regiment**  | **Regiment**    | Represents a full thematic structure (e.g., the entire OS or RS progression)            |
| **Storypoint Division**  | **Division**    | Full narrative structure (OS + MC + IC + RS) â€” the whole damn story                     |
| **Campaign**             | **Campaign**    | Series of stories or narratives in a shared world â€” your IP or series canon             |
