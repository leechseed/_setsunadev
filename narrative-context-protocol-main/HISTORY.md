## The Dramatica Theory of Story

Originally developed by Chris Huntley and Melanie Anne Phillips in the early 1990s, the Dramatica® Theory of Story offered a groundbreaking approach to narrative structure, emphasizing the interplay of multiple perspectives to create cohesive and resonant storytelling experiences. Launched in 1993 and comprehensively documented in their seminal 1994 book, *“Dramatica: A New Theory of Story,”* it introduced an objective model of narrative defining clear, measurable dynamics underpinning every compelling story.

By mapping relationships between characters, plot elements, and thematic concerns, Dramatica established itself as a unique and influential framework. Narrative Context Protocol (NCP) builds directly upon this legacy, refining and extending these foundational concepts to embrace modern advancements in AI-driven storytelling.

## Evolution & Development of Narrative Context Protocol (NCP)

Narrative Context Protocol (NCP) was developed as a next-generation schema for multi-agentic systems, designed to enhance narrative consistency, scalability, and AI-driven storytelling capabilities.

**Version 1.0 of NCP** mirrors the robust API framework available within Narrative First’s Subtxt/Dramatica platform. Engineered for narrative precision and innovative AI-driven storytelling, the Subtxt/Dramatica platform encapsulates an objective, measurable approach to narrative structure.

Narrative First chose to openly share this schema, driven by the belief that storytelling should be accessible and transparent to everyone. By opening the "code" behind narrative structure, the goal is to foster creativity, collaboration, and innovation across all storytelling communities.

## The NCP Project at ETC/USC

Narrative Context Protocol (UNM) is driven by an extraordinary team of visionaries and narrative experts dedicated to revolutionizing storytelling through technology and innovation. Funded by USC’s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), the project benefits from the strategic leadership of Executive Producer Paul Bennun, whose extensive experience at the intersection of entertainment and technology shapes the project's ambitious vision.

Project Lead George Gerba, renowned for his pioneering approach to narrative technologies, oversees the implementation and evolution of NCP, ensuring the protocol remains both groundbreaking and practical for contemporary narrative artists.

Narrative theorist Hank Gerba further enriches the project with his profound understanding of narrative structures and generative AI. His influential white paper, [*"NARRATIVE CONTEXT PROTOCOL: AN AUTHOR-CENTRIC STORYTELLING FRAMEWORK FOR GENERATIVE AI,"*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04844) has become a cornerstone for those exploring the powerful intersection of storytelling and artificial intelligence.

Together, this dedicated group is charting a forward-looking path, passionately committed to empowering authors and creators with cutting-edge tools designed to amplify human creativity and narrative ingenuity in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI storytelling.
