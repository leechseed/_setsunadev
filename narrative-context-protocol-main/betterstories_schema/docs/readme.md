# 🧠 BetterStories

> **A leaner, meaner storytelling schema for multi-agent narrative systems.**

BetterStories is a fully refactored, modular schema designed to replace bloated narrative specs with clean, normalized structure. Built for narrative engineers, AI agents, and post-human storytellers, it's ideal for simulations, pipelines, and multi-agent logic systems.

Forget 144-line enums and nesting hell—this is JSON Schema reimagined with real data architecture principles.

## 🔥 Why BetterStories?

Most narrative specs are:

- ❌ Redundant
- ❌ Hard to scale
- ❌ Not built for relational thinking

**BetterStories** is:

- ✅ Modular (`$defs` + `$ref`)
- ✅ DRY and composable
- ✅ Ready for agent systems, story engines, and structured story ops
- ✅ Inspired by normalized DB design, not ad hoc front-end hacks

## 📦 Features

- 🔁 **Centralized Definitions** – Define once, reuse everywhere.
- 🧱 **Modular Story Architecture** – Built like a relational database, not a spaghetti JSON blob.
- ⚖️ **Strict Validation** – Enforced with `additionalProperties: false`.
- 🧠 **Semantic Enum Structuring** – Reduced massive enums into curated, extensible types.
- 🧩 **Composable Components** – Drop-in-ready schema pieces like `StoryPoint`, `Perspective`, `Player`, and `StoryBeat`.
- 🤖 **Agent-Friendly** – Designed to interoperate with narrative agents, GPT pipelines, simulation frameworks, and hybrid systems.

## 🧬 Philosophy

> _“The schema is not the story. But it can make your story understandable to machines, to teams, and to time itself.”_

BetterStories was built to support:

- Multi-character viewpoint logic
- Cognitive framing (POV, tone, dynamic vector)
- Structural theory integration (Dramatica, NCP, etc.)
- Contextual narrative planning

## 🛠 Example Use Cases

- AI story generators using discrete agent reasoning
- Simulation frameworks for character-driven worlds
- Longform interactive fiction tools
- Dramatica + NCP hybrid narrative platforms
- Structured worldbuilding / IP scaffolding
