# How to Use The Goon Room

## Purpose
The Goon Room is your primary workspace for chaotic research, drafting, and creative flow.

## Daily Workflow

### 1. Start a Session
Create a dated file: `_GOON_ROOM/sessions/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md`

### 2. Work Freely
- Dump thoughts
- Research
- Draft
- Experiment
- No structure required

### 3. Tag As You Go
- `#canon-ready` → Ready for canon promotion
- `#ssot-candidate` → Potential methodology update
- `#auth-candidate` → Potential story update
- `#experiment` → Just testing
- `#reference` → Keep but not canon

### 4. Weekly Review
- Search for `#canon-ready`
- Move to `_STAGED/` for review
- Eventually promote to `_CANON/`

## File Naming Convention
`YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive_topic.md`

Example: `2026-02-10_mars_aspects_research.md`

## Don't Worry About
- Organization
- Cleanup
- Structure
- Perfect formatting

## Focus On
- Capturing ideas
- Following creative flow
- Tagging for later retrieval
