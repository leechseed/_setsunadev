## What Even Is This

**\_setsunadev** is a personal monorepo for systematic narrative creation. This is what happens when you treat story development with the rigor of a three-star Michelin kitchen instead of running on vibes and developmental chaos.

**The Stack:**

- **Dramatica Theory** - Formal story structure engine providing thematic arguments, character dynamics, plot progression
- **GUTS99** - 12-subsystem media influence analysis cataloging aesthetic DNA across film, anime, literature, games, music, art, comics, theater, and web culture
- **Narrative Context Protocol (NCP)** - Git-style attribution system for structured narrative data with proper schema
- **Esoteric Character Systems** - Astrology and tarot as systematic personality generators
- **Bermuda Quadrilateral** - Meta-framework for creative energy flow between Science, Engineering, Design, and Art
- **Hugo/Obsidian/Logseq/Final Draft** - The actual tools for building, publishing, and managing the chaos

**What This Actually Does:**

- Structures stories using formal narrative theory instead of "gardening"
- Tracks aesthetic influences systematically so you know exactly what DNA went into your work
- Versions story iterations like software releases (because they should be)
- Provides AI collaborators with structured markdown optimized for LLM ingestion
- Maintains operational SOPs because you will forget.

## The Architecture (Or: How Deep Does This Rabbit Hole Go)

```
Media Consumption → GUTS99 Analysis → Aesthetic DNA Profile
                                          ↓
Creative Theory (Bermuda Quadrilateral) → Story Premise
                                          ↓
Dramatica Storyform → Character/Plot/Theme Structure
                                          ↓
Esoteric Systems (Astrology/Tarot) → Character Personality + Plot Arcs
                                          ↓
NCP Schema → Structured Story Data (JSON/SQLite)
                                          ↓
Final Draft / Manuscript → Screenplay / Prose Output
                                          ↓
Hugo Static Site → Published Documentation
```

### Key Frameworks Explained (Sort Of)

**Dramatica** - The nuclear reactor at the core. Treats stories as complete arguments with precision. Every character, plot point, and theme connects to a unified "storyform" that proves a thematic point. It's like if formal logic had a baby with narrative structure.

**GUTS99** - Media influence fingerprinting system. 12 subsystems track what aesthetic DNA actually matters:

- VISCERA (Film)
- NEOGUTS (Anime)
- LYMPH (Literature)
- LUDOVORE (Games)
- AUDIVA (Music)
- LUSTRA (Visual Art)
- OCULON (Photography)
- TENDRA (Comics/Manga)
- EPOCHE (Theater/Performance)
- PANELOS (Architecture/Design)
- MYOFLEX (Dance/Movement)
- VERBOMANCY (Web Culture/Memes)

Currently at baseline (12 entries), targeting 30-40+ per subsystem.

**Narrative Context Protocol** - Open-source schema for structured story data with git-style attribution. Because collaborative AI storytelling needs actual infrastructure, not vibes.

**Bermuda Quadrilateral** - Creative energy management framework. Maps the flow between Science (research), Engineering (systems), Design (aesthetics), and Art (intuition). Also known as the Krebs Cycle of Creativity.

## The Builds: A Version History

Story iterations tracked using software-style versioning.

| Version | Codename               | Stage      | Year | Notes                                           |

**Naming Convention:** `[Status]_[Version].[Iteration]_[Codename]_BUILD`

- `X_` or `XX_` prefix = archived/deprecated (don't touch)
- `_` prefix = active (current work)
- RC = Release Candidate (almost there)

## Getting Started (Barely Helpful Edition)

**If you want to understand this project:**

1. Read this README (you're doing it)
2. Explore `_broodengine/` for theory
3. Check `_grognard/` for aesthetic context
4. Look at `_2025.02_SELACIOUS_BUILD/` for current work
5. Realize this is a four-year evolution and you're seeing the middle, not the beginning

**If you want to steal ideas:**

1. Fork the repo
2. Take what works for you
3. Leave the rest

**If you want to use the frameworks:**

- GUTS99: Create your own `_grognard/` directory, start cataloging influences
- Dramatica: Learn the theory first (it's complex as fuck), then structure your stories
- NCP: Implement the schema for your own projects
- Bermuda Quadrilateral: Use it to map your creative process

**If you want support:**

- lmao no
- Issues are disabled
- PRs will be ignored
- Vibe the code
- Figure it out

## The Philosophy: Why This Madness

**The Three-Star Michelin Kitchen Principle:**

Most people treat writing like cooking at home - throw some ingredients together, taste as you go, hope it works out. That's fine.

But if you're running a three-star Michelin kitchen, you:

- Document every technique
- Measure every ingredient
- Understand the chemistry
- Maintain systems
- Train consistently
- Refine endlessly
- Deliver precision

Story development should work the same way. Not because it makes it "better" (arguable), but because it makes it **systematic and scalable**.

**The Dual-Banded Approach:**

- Research what makes stories work → Build frameworks to capture that
- Build frameworks → Use them to create stories → Learn what's missing → Research more
- The tools shape the stories, the stories shape the tools
- 'Story is the shape of change.' WIP heuristic.

**Why The Esoteric Stuff:**

Astrology and tarot are systematic personality generation engines with thousands of years of cultural testing. Need a character with specific psychological dynamics? Match their chart to the Dramatica archetype. Need plot events that feel fated? Map tarot progressions to story beats.

**Why Version Everything:**

Creative work is iterative work. Track the evolution. See what changed. Understand why. Treat your creative process like the complex problem it actually is.

MIT License (2024)

Do whatever you want with this. Fork it, steal it, burn it, worship it. I literally cannot stop you and I'm not going to try.

The only rule: Don't pretend you invented this methodology. Credit where it's due. Back burner project...Bibliography of the entirety of private collection of IRL books and pdfs utilized.

## Contact

Don't.

If you absolutely must:

- Read the code first
- Check if your question is answered in the docs
- Realize it probably isn't because I haven't written all the docs yet
- Accept that this is a personal project and I owe you nothing
- Move on with your life

## Final Notes

This is **version ???** of a four-year experiment in treating narrative creation as infrastructure engineering. It's messy, it's comprehensive, it's probably overkill, and it works. For me.

**Is it worth it?** Ask me when the stories are published.  
**Should you do this?** No. Bye.
