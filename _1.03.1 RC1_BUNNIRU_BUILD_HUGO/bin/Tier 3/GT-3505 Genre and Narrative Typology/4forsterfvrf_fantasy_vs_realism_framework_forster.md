### 1. **Forster's Fantasy vs. Realism Framework**

- **Fantasy**:  
  - **Definition**: E.M. Forster explores the role of *fantasy* in literature and contrasts it with realism. While realism aims to depict life as it is—grounded in the observable and everyday—fantasy transcends these constraints, allowing authors to create new worlds, scenarios, and events that defy the laws of reality. This gives fantasy a unique canvas for exploring the imagination, distinct from the limitations of realism.

### 3. **Theoretical Significance in Narratology**
Forster’s framework on fantasy and realism highlights a crucial theoretical distinction in narratology—the balance between the depiction of reality and the boundless possibilities of imagination. His exploration sheds light on how both modes can serve different narrative functions, with realism focusing on the tangible and familiar, while fantasy opens up creative avenues to explore abstract ideas, alternate realities, and deeper psychological truths. Forster’s contribution underscores the versatility of literary forms in representing different aspects of the human experience.

---

### 4. **Conclusion**
Forster’s exploration of fantasy vs. realism underscores the value of both literary modes. Realism provides an authentic reflection of the world as we know it, while fantasy extends beyond reality, offering limitless imaginative possibilities. Together, these forms contribute to a fuller exploration of the human condition, with realism grounding readers in the familiar, and fantasy expanding their perception of what is possible in literature and life. This duality enriches the reader’s experience and allows for a deeper understanding of
