## Core Competencies of Narratology

The core competencies of narratology encompass various aspects of narrative analysis. Below is a list of these competencies along with their definitions:

### NS001 Narrative Structure

Understanding how a story is organized, including its beginning, middle, and end. This involves analyzing the framework that holds the narrative together,such as:

- **Exposition**
- **Rising Action**
- **Climax**
- **Falling Action**
- **Resolution**

### SD Story vs. Discourse (Fabula vs. Sjuzhet)
- **Story (Fabula)**: The raw chronological sequence of events in a narrative.
- **Discourse (Sjuzhet)**: The way these events are presented or structured in the narrative.

This competency involves differentiating between the actual events and their representation.

### Narration and Narrator Analysis

Identifying who tells the story and examining their role, perspective, and reliability. This includes:

- **First-person Narrator**
- **Second-person Narrator**
- **Third-person Narrator**
- **Omniscient and Limited Perspectives**

### Focalization

Understanding through whose consciousness the events of the story are perceived. This involves analyzing the point of view and how it influences the reader's perception.

### Time and Temporality

Examining how time is manipulated in the narrative, including:

- **Order**: The sequence in which events are narrated, which may not be chronological.
- **Duration**: The relationship between the time events take in the story and the time taken to narrate them.
- **Frequency**: How often events occur within the narrative.

### Characterization

Analyzing how characters are developed and presented, including their traits, motivations, and relationships. This involves understanding both direct and indirect methods of characterization.

### Plot and Event Analysis

Examining the sequence of events and their causal relationships within the narrative. This focuses on how events drive the story forward and create tension or conflict.

### Narrative Levels and Embedding

Recognizing shifts between different narrative levels:

- **Diegetic Level**: The primary narrative world.
- **Metadiegetic Level**: Stories within the story (embedded narratives).
- **Extradiegetic Level**: The narrator's level outside the primary narrative.

### Intertextuality

Identifying references, allusions, or connections to other texts within a narrative. This explores how these connections add layers of meaning.

### Diegesis and Mimesis

- **Diegesis**: Narrative told through the narrator's description.
- **Mimesis**: Narrative shown through direct representation, such as dialogue.

Understanding the balance between showing and telling in a narrative.

### Narrative Voice and Point of View

Analyzing the linguistic and stylistic features that define the narrator's voice, including tone, style, and the narrator's attitude toward the events and characters.

### Semiotics of Narrative

Studying the signs and symbols used within a narrative and how they contribute to meaning. This involves interpreting metaphors, motifs, and symbolic elements.

### Genre and Narrative Typology

Understanding the conventions of different narrative genres (e.g., epic, tragedy, comedy) and how they influence the structure and themes of a narrative.

### Narrative Space and Setting

Analyzing how the physical and social environments in which the story takes place affect the characters and plot, including the symbolic significance of settings.

### Narrative Coherence and Logic

Evaluating the internal consistency of the narrative, ensuring that events and character actions are plausible within the story's context.

### Function and Motif Analysis

Identifying recurring elements and their functions within the narrative, often drawing on structuralist theories such as those proposed by Vladimir Propp.

### Tense, Mood, and Voice in Narrative Grammar

Understanding how grammatical choices affect the narrative, including:

- **Tense**: The temporal aspects (past, present, future) used in narration.
- **Mood**: The attitude conveyed by the narrator, such as certainty or doubt.
- **Voice**: Active or passive constructions.

### Narratee and Implied Reader

Recognizing the audience within the narrative, including:

- **Narratee**: The character within the story to whom the narrator is speaking.
- **Implied Reader**: The ideal reader envisioned by the text.

### Metalepsis and Narrative Transgression

Understanding instances where the narrative breaks its own boundaries, such as characters addressing the reader or acknowledging they are in a story.

### Narrative Ethics and Ideology

Analyzing the moral, ethical, and ideological messages conveyed through the narrative, including how stories reflect or challenge societal norms and values.
