### **Explanation**

> **Plot** refers to the sequence of events that transpire in your story.  
> If you already have some ideas about your story's plot, list them here.  
> Try not to be overly literary or descriptive at this point. You only need enough information to identify the key events that link together to advance your story from where it begins to where it ends.  
> This information will be used as reference material for later development in other screens.

---

### **Theory**

> **Plots** can be simple or complex.
>
> - There can be a single plot to a story or any number of subplots.
> - Some stories even have two or more independent plots that run in parallel, never affecting each other but providing a sense of contrast for the audience.

> Since the **StoryGuide** process is designed as an introductory path through Dramatica, practical considerations dictate that we focus on a single plot at a time.  
> If you have a multiple-plot or subplot story, not to worry! After completing the StoryGuide path, you can create additional subplots and incorporate them into the overall story.

> For now, briefly describe the key plot events you may have already developed for your story, if any.

### **Usage**

#### **Example**: _Star Wars_

1. Orphaned Luke Skywalker, who works on his uncle's farm, chases a runaway robot helper into the desert where he encounters a retired warrior with mystic powers, Obi Wan Kenobi.

   - The robot has a hidden message that leads Luke and Obi on a race across the galaxy to get important information to rebel fighters against the Evil Empire.

2. Along the way, they join forces with an unruly transport pilot who gives them passage off the planet.

   - The Empire tries to stop them in a big laser gun battle, but they escape.

3. Later, they get captured by Darth Vader aboard a huge space station with a weapon that can destroy whole planets.

   - There, they rescue Princess Leia, a leader of the Rebels, who joins them in their race to get the information into the right hands.
   - Again, they escape except for Obi Wan, who is killed (though his spirit lives on to guide Luke).

4. Eventually, they hook up with the Rebels and hand over the information that shows how to destroy the space station weapon.

   - Luke gets his chance to be a fighter pilot when he joins the rebels, and they all blast into space to do battle with the space station which has tracked them down.

5. In the end, Luke (guided by Obi's spirit) learns to rely on his own skills and single-handedly destroys the weapon just when all hope seems lost.
   - He comes back a hero and a legendary warrior in his own right.
