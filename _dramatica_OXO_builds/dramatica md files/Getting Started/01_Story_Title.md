### 1.2. **Explanation**

### 1.3. **Theory**

> The title of your story may or may not have dramatic significance.  
> In some cases, the meaning of the title may become apparent only during the course or even at the end of a story. There have even been stories in which the final understanding of the message is only achieved when the title becomes the last piece in the puzzle.

### 1.4. **Usage**

#### 1.4.1. Example:

Imagine all the other titles _Star Wars_ might have had. In fact, it was originally titled _Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode One of the Star Wars_, then _Adventures of Luke Starkiller_, and later _The Journal Of The Whills_. You can immediately feel the impact of a change in title on your impression of the story.

#### 1.4.2. Consideration:

Other examples include:

- **The Verdict** – Refers to the story's climax.
- **Alien** – Refers to the subject matter.
- **The Silence of the Lambs** – Refers to the Main Character's personal problems.
