**Prompt for ChatGPT-4 to Optimize Note-Taking Strategies**

Develop a comprehensive guide for creating optimized and effective research notes. The guide should include techniques for paraphrasing, organizing, and comprehending information. Discuss the use of memory systems to enhance information retention by chunking verbal and non-verbal data. Emphasize the importance of ignoring irrelevant information to maximize memory capacity.

Detail three methods for selecting important content:
1. Highlighting: Outline best practices for highlighting, such as using a single color and limiting highlighted content to 10% of the text. Explain how highlighting should be integrated into broader note-taking strategies, especially when dealing with dense information.
2. Headings: Describe how headings serve as organizational signals that facilitate the recall of topics and their structure within the text.
3. Summaries: Differentiate between types of summaries—topical summary, overview, and advance organizer—and provide a checklist for creating effective summaries, including identifying and rephrasing the main ideas and supporting details in one's own words.

Include strategies for using text structures to guide note-taking, explaining how different structures (e.g., description, sequence, comparison, problem-solution) cue important information and suggest appropriate formats for notes.

Finally, compare the use of outlines and graphic organizers in note-taking. Discuss scenarios where each method is most effective, and provide guidelines for deciding when to use each type based on the text’s structure and complexity. Include considerations for choosing the right type of graphic organizer, such as trees, matrices, or flowcharts, to best represent the relationships and hierarchy in the information. 

Ensure the guide is structured to facilitate easy understanding and practical application of each strategy, enhancing both recall and comprehension of study materials.
