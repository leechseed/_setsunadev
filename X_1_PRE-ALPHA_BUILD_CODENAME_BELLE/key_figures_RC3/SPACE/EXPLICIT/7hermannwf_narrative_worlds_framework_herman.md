### 1. Title: **Herman's Narrative Worlds Framework**

- **Narrative Worlds**:
  - **Definition**: Herman introduces the concept of _narrative worlds,_ which are the imagined environments that narratives create, housing characters and events. These worlds are constructed through language and function as spaces for exploring hypothetical scenarios, ethical dilemmas, and alternative realities.

---

### 2. **Key Concepts**

#### 2.1. **Possible Worlds Theory**

- **Definition**:
  - Herman’s concept of narrative worlds is closely aligned with possible worlds theory, a framework in philosophy and literary theory that explores the idea of multiple, alternate realities. In this context, narrative worlds are seen as self-contained, imagined environments that exist parallel to the real world. These worlds are crafted through the narrative and provide a space where characters interact, events unfold, and themes are explored.

##### 2.1.1. **Components of Possible Worlds Theory**

###### 2.1.1.1. **Characters**

- **Definition**: Characters in possible worlds serve as the agents who experience, influence, and navigate different realities within the narrative, shaped by the unique contexts of their respective worlds.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A[**Characters**]
    A --> B[**Complex Motivations**];
    A --> C[**Identity Formation**];
    A --> D[**Relational Dynamics**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Complex Motivations**: The motivations of characters are often shaped by the unique conditions of their world, influencing how they act and respond across alternate realities.
  - **Identity Formation**: Characters’ identities are crafted in relation to the specific rules, cultural norms, and environments of their world, creating a diverse cast across possible worlds.
  - **Relational Dynamics**: The relationships between characters are influenced by the structure of their reality, impacting alliances, conflicts, and emotional connections in unique ways.

###### 2.1.1.2. **Agency**

- **Definition**: Agency in possible worlds refers to the capacity of characters to make decisions and take actions that impact the course of events, both within their own world and across multiple realities.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    E[**Agency**]
    E --> F[**Autonomous Actions**];
    E --> G[**Inter-Reality Influence**];
    E --> H[**Moral Responsibility**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Autonomous Actions**: Characters exercise agency by making choices that shift the trajectory of events, often setting off ripple effects that influence other worlds.
  - **Inter-Reality Influence**: Some characters have the ability to traverse or impact multiple worlds, amplifying the reach and consequences of their decisions.
  - **Moral Responsibility**: Characters with agency face moral and ethical decisions, as their actions can have significant impacts on their own reality and potentially on others.

###### 2.1.1.3. **Alternate Realities**

- **Definition**: In Possible Worlds Theory, alternate realities refer to the different versions of reality created within a narrative, each with its own unique set of rules, characters, and outcomes.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    I[**Alternate Realities**]
    I --> J[**Distinct Worldbuilding**];
    I --> K[**Narrative Divergence**];
    I --> L[**Internal Consistency**];
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Distinct Worldbuilding**: Each alternate reality is meticulously constructed with unique settings, histories, and societal norms that differentiate it from the primary world.
  - **Narrative Divergence**: Events within alternate realities may follow paths that diverge significantly from the main story, allowing exploration of “what-if” scenarios.
  - **Internal Consistency**: Although distinct, these realities maintain their own logic and coherence, ensuring that they are believable within the context of the narrative.

#### 2.2. **World-Building**

- **Definition**: The process of constructing a detailed and coherent narrative world, complete with its own rules, cultures, and histories.

```mermaid
