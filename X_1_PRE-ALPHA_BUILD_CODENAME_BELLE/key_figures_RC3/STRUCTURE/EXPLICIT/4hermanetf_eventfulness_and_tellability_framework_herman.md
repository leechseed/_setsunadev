### 1. Title: **Herman's Eventfulness and Tellability Framework**

- **Eventfulness and Tellability**:
  - **Definition**: In _"Story Logic,"_ David Herman introduces the concepts of _eventfulness_ and _tellability,_ central to understanding why certain narratives capture an audience's interest. _Eventfulness_ refers to the significance and impact of events within a story—those moments that alter the narrative's course. _Tellability_ concerns the qualities that make a story engaging, thought-provoking, or worth sharing with others.

- **Definition**:
  - Eventfulness measures the pivotal significance of events within a narrative. An event is eventful if it alters the narrative’s trajectory, deeply impacts characters, or shapes the plot in memorable ways.
