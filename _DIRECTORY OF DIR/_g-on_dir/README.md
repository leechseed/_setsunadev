# .G-ON.IP.ROOT

## Overview

Welcome to the .G-ON.IP.ROOT project! This repository contains the comprehensive documentation for the G-ON narrative IP, including details on characters, plot (fabula), and settings.

## Note

**Please note that this project is a work in progress. I actively maintain and develop it as time allows. Design decisions are prioritized to align with my vision for the project. Your understanding and patience are appreciated.**

## Statement of Purpose

The purpose of this open-source project is to provide developing narrative designers with an example of how one can use open-source and locally stored philosophies in the development of their narrative projects. For the past several years, I have used closed-source knowledgebase projects such as Obsidian, Logseq, Evernote, Milanote, etc., and found that the common limitation of all these programs is their lack of customizability beyond the specific use cases they were designed for.

Speaking in general terms, there seems to be a trend where developers of these tools focus on solving one problem that the others do not. While this is great from a software development standpoint, as a narrative designer—specifically of hypertextual intermediated fictional intellectual properties (e.g., Marvel, Harry Potter, Mass Effect)—scale, flexibility, data access, data control, and data flow management are crucial to a manageable design experience.

Narrative design—whether authorship, narrative game design, screenwriting, etc.—has always been and will always be a challenging and lucrative industry to partake in. However, with the advent of AI, democratized online content platforms, and the insatiable demand for quality and heartfelt storytelling, there has never been a better time for those who want to become great storytellers to start their journey.

Unfortunately, with the growth and disruption of the industry, those who dream of telling stories will encounter old standards of practice that can be obstacles. Whether it’s individuals in academic ivory towers prioritizing personal achievement and philosophical trends over quality education or self-made authors grifting their own audiences to shore up multiple supply chains, these outdated practices have contributed to the downfall and ultimate demise of traditional media. This project is the beginning of my efforts to provide those who are lost or in need of a fresh perspective on the narrative design industry with all the research I have conducted, my theories, criticisms, as well as a practical use case of such. 

Please bear with me, and together we shall prosper in a world that embraces our humanity and brings people together rather than weaponizes our talents for vice and greed. Ciao.

## Ethical Statement

I actively use AI and incorporate it as a core element in my practice. I believe in the potential of AI to enhance creativity and productivity in narrative design. While I plan to create a more detailed document on my beliefs in the future, for the current scope of this project, AI is integral to my workflow and methodologies.
