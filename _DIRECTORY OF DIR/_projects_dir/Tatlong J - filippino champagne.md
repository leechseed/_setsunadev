Here is a **comprehensive summary and overview** of our discussion, organized by topic for clarity:

---

### **1. Tapuy Fermentation and Flavor Experimentation**

- **Overview**:

  - Tapuy, a traditional Filipino rice wine, can be innovatively paired with modern fermentation techniques like using a SCOBY for carbonation and flavor enhancement.
  - Combining the sweet, nutty flavors of tapuy with SCOBY fermentation introduces tangy, slightly acidic notes.

- **Key Insights**:
  - SCOBY fermentation adds natural carbonation, probiotics, and complexity.
  - Mechanical carbonation is more efficient for consistent production but lacks the flavor depth and probiotics that a SCOBY provides.
  - Flavor infusions like fruits (e.g., calamansi, mango) or herbs (e.g., pandan) can enhance the profile further.

### **2. Aging Tapuy in Wood or Alternative Materials**

- **Key Woods Identified**:

  1. **White Oak**: Traditional choice for vanilla, caramel, and spice notes.
  2. **Coconut Wood**: Adds tropical, nutty flavors and a distinct Filipino character.
  3. **Cherry Wood**: Contributes fruity and almond-like undertones.
  4. **Hickory**: Bold, smoky flavors for stronger profiles.
  5. **Cypress**: Subtle earthy and woody tones.
  6. **Maple**: Sweet, brown sugar-like flavor.
  7. **Mango Wood**: Slightly resinous, tropical notes.

- **Innovative Materials**:
  - **Sugarcane**: Toasted sugarcane as an aging medium or infusion offers molasses-like sweetness and tropical grassy notes.
  - Toasting enhances sugarcane’s flavor, which can be directly added to a still or aging vessel for unique results.

---

### **3. Flavor Profiles and Pairing**

- **Dual-Fermented Tapuy**:

  - Combines sweetness from rice with tanginess from SCOBY.
  - Suitable for tropical or dessert-inspired beverages.

- **Flavor Infusion Ideas**:
  - Fruits: Citrus (calamansi, orange), tropical fruits (pineapple, mango).
  - Herbs and Spices: Pandan, vanilla, cinnamon.
  - Sugarcane: Enhances sweetness and complements natural tapuy flavors.

---

### **4. Barrels and Alternatives**

- **Barrel Aging**:

  - Traditional oak barrels offer durability, oxygen exchange, and complex flavor extraction.
  - Other tropical woods like coconut, mango, and cherry provide regionally authentic flavors.

- **Sugarcane Aging**:
  - Toasted sugarcane introduces molasses-like and smoky notes.
  - Can be used as chips, staves, or even fresh stalks in aging vessels.
  - Sugarcane barrels are challenging to construct but feasible for experimental batches.

### **5. Sweetness Classification in Filipino Context**

- Inspired by Champagne's sweetness grading, we explored Tagalog and Ilocano equivalents:
  - **Tagalog**:
    - "Walang Tamís" (Brut/No Sweetness)
    - "Kaunting Tamís" (Sec/Slight Sweetness)
    - "Katamtamang Tamís" (Demi-Sec/Moderate Sweetness)
    - "Matamis" (Doux/Sweet)
    - "Napakatamis" (Very Sweet)
  - **Ilocano**:
    - "Awan Tamís" (Brut/No Sweetness)
    - "Bassit a Tamís" (Sec/Slight Sweetness)
    - "Usto a Tamís" (Demi-Sec/Moderate Sweetness)
    - "Tamís" (Doux/Sweet)
    - "Napintas a Tamís" (Very Sweet)

### **6. Natural Fermentation and Yeast Capture**

- We discussed natural fermentation methods, such as capturing wild yeast from fruits, flowers, or the air, to make a natural starter for tapuy.
- **Comparison to Bubod**:
  - Bubod includes molds like _Aspergillus_ for starch-to-sugar conversion, while sourdough or kombucha relies on wild yeast and bacteria.

---

### **7. Shelf Stability**

- Challenges with live-fermented beverages like SCOBY-aged tapuy include:
  - Continued microbial activity can lead to over-carbonation.
  - Pasteurization, filtration, and refrigeration are methods to stabilize the product.
- **Sugarcane's Role in Shelf Stability**:
  - Toasting sugarcane minimizes microbial risks and enhances shelf-stable sweetness.

---

### **8. Summary of Innovations**

1. **Using SCOBY for Natural Carbonation**:
   - Probiotic-rich, tangy tapuy variants with tropical character.
2. **Sugarcane as an Aging Medium**:
   - Toasted sugarcane adds depth and sweetness, avoiding structural challenges of wood barrels.
3. **Regional Wood Options**:
   - Exploring Filipino and Floridian woods (e.g., coconut, hickory, cherry) for aging to create unique flavors.
4. **Sweetness Grading**:
   - Using Tagalog/Ilocano terms for culturally authentic labeling.

---

### **Conclusion**

The combination of traditional tapuy fermentation methods with innovative aging techniques—like sugarcane infusion or tropical wood barrels—can create a distinctly Filipino spirit with broad appeal. By balancing sweetness, flavor infusion, and shelf stability, this approach bridges cultural authenticity and modern craft beverage practices. This project would celebrate Filipino heritage while pushing the boundaries of artisanal spirit-making.
