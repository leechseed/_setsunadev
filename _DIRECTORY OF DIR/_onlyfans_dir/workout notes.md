# Thick Current Routine

 *As a reminder, this routine is designed for anyone looking to develop an androgynous or more feminine physique. This includes men, women, cross-dressers, folks on HRT, and anyone else that might be interested. If the title of this subreddit bothers you (and I don't love it), then feel free to ignore it entirely. Also consider joining our workout group!

And if you're completely new to fitness, I would still recommend start with the FAQ.

Otherwise, read on!

If you're an absolute beginner, stick with just the exercises marked (B). This will be a super simple three exercise routine (plus cardio!) that you can perform with weights or bodyweight in about twenty minutes. This should help you develop the muscle and form to get started on your fitness journey. If you think you're moderately fit then try to complete all the listed exercises.

Also you can do almost all of these exercises with bodyweight, but a few purchases (a single dumbbell, an ab wheel, ankle weights) will help tremendously. And these are fairly cheap.

(B) Squats (3x20 bodyweight or 3x12 weighted). Most folks don't go low enough with their squats. As a rough guideline, the top of your thighs should be parallel with the ground. You should feel it in your butt at the end of the movement. If you're only feeling it in your thighs/quads, then you might not be going low enough. You can also focus on driving up from your heels to emphasize glute activation.

(B) Lunges or Step-Ups (3x20 bodyweight or 3x12 weighted). I like these because they're relatively easy to perform and activate the glutes more than almost any other exercise. They also include some Glute Medius/Minimus stabilizer activation. And I prefer walking lunges (like actually lunge-walking some distance) over stationary lunges as these emphasize the glutes a bit more.

(B) Glute Bridges (3x20 bodyweight or 3x12 weighted). This is the classic glute builder. Weight helps here. Fitness models you see on Instagram are sometimes glute bridging/hip thrusting very very heavy weights (~200 to 300lbs!). I try to do these with a heavy dumbbell or with one leg floating off the ground. I should still probably get to a gym and go heavier though...

Fire Hydrants (3x20 bodyweight or 3x12 with ankle weights). These hit the outer aspects of the butt (the Glute Medius and Minimus). These are small muscles that can be developed to obtain slightly wider glutes/hips. I typically only recommend these with ankle weights or resistance bands, as I don't think bodyweight alone is enough for most people.

Side Plank Abductions (3x20 bodyweight per side). This is a new exercise I've been using for the past year. I think it's amazing as it hits your core and Glute Medius/Minimus. It can also be done without any equipment. If this is too difficult, try a simple side leg raise or a banded abduction.

Core Work (ab wheel 3x6-10 rollouts). I almost universally recommend buying an ab wheel here. These are very very efficient in building dynamic core strength. When 6-10 rollouts gets to be too easy, bump it up to 10-15 or 15-20. Alternatively, here's an excellent plank variation you can do. Try to get to 10 taps with each hip.

Cardio! Cardio is it's own thing and too complex for a simple entry on this routine. But my general recommendation is to find something you enjoy that gets your heart rate up and do it 2-3 times a week. Raquetball, basketball, swimming, running, jazzercise... whatever. And if you're not used to doing anything, maybe try putting on a podcast and just walking in a park for 30 minutes twice a week?
