# Automating Data Collection for Social Media Accounts

## Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to automate the process of collecting data from Twitter, OnlyFans, and JFF using APIs and web scraping techniques. It includes Python scripts and instructions on how to set up the environment.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tweepy (for Twitter API)
- Requests and BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Pandas (for handling spreadsheets)

## Steps

### 1. Twitter Data
To get the number of followers of a Twitter account, you can use the Twitter API.

#### Using Twitter API

1. **Set Up Twitter Developer Account**: 
   - Create a Twitter Developer account and get your API keys.

2. **Python Script**:
   ```python
   import tweepy

   # Replace with your own credentials
   api_key = 'your_api_key'
   api_secret_key = 'your_api_secret_key'
   access_token = 'your_access_token'
   access_token_secret = 'your_access_token_secret'

   auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(api_key, api_secret_key, access_token, access_token_secret)
   api = tweepy.API(auth)

   def get_twitter_followers(username):
       user = api.get_user(screen_name=username)
       return user.followers_count

   username = '404champ'
   followers_count = get_twitter_followers(username)
   print(f"{username} has {followers_count} followers.")
   ```

### 2. OnlyFans and JFF Data
Since OnlyFans and JFF do not have public APIs, you will need to use web scraping to extract the required data.

#### Using BeautifulSoup and Requests for Web Scraping

1. **Install the libraries**:
   ```sh
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Python Script**:
   ```python
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

   def get_of_likes(url):
       response = requests.get(url)
       soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
       # Adjust the selector based on the actual HTML structure
       likes = soup.find('div', {'class': 'some-likes-class'}).text
       return likes

   def get_jff_likes(url):
       response = requests.get(url)
       soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
       # Adjust the selector based on the actual HTML structure
       likes = soup.find('div', {'class': 'some-likes-class'}).text
       return likes

   of_url = 'https://onlyfans.com/cashbaby404'
   jff_url = 'https://jff.com/some-profile'
   of_likes = get_of_likes(of_url)
   jff_likes = get_jff_likes(jff_url)
   print(f"OF Likes: {of_likes}, JFF Likes: {jff_likes}")
   ```

### 3. Automate the Process
Create a script that reads your spreadsheet, fetches the required data using the above methods, and writes the data back to the spreadsheet.

#### Using pandas to read and write to Excel:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the spreadsheet
df = pd.read_excel('your_spreadsheet.xlsx')

# Add columns for the fetched data
df['Twitter Followers'] = df['Twitter Username'].apply(get_twitter_followers)
df['OF Likes'] = df['OF URL'].apply(get_of_likes)
df['JFF Likes'] = df['JFF URL'].apply(get_jff_likes)

# Save the updated spreadsheet
df.to_excel('updated_spreadsheet.xlsx', index=False)
```

### 4. Running the Script Regularly
To automate this process, you can set up a cron job (on Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) to run the script at regular intervals.

## Notes
- Adjust the HTML parsing part (`find` method in BeautifulSoup) according to the actual structure of the OnlyFans and JFF pages, as the class names or IDs used for likes might be different.
- Ensure you comply with the terms of service of each platform when using their data.
