# **McKee's Turning Points Model**

## **McKee's Turning Points**

In **Robert McKee's** comprehensive guide **"Story"**, **turning points** are identified as pivotal moments that drive the narrative forward, shaping the protagonist's journey and influencing the story's direction. McKee highlights the significance of these moments in maintaining narrative momentum and ensuring continuous audience engagement.

#### **Definition and Importance**

**Turning points** are critical junctures in a story where significant changes occur, altering the course of the narrative and the protagonist's path. These moments serve to heighten tension, introduce new conflicts, and deepen character development. McKee asserts that well-crafted turning points are essential for keeping the story dynamic and preventing stagnation.

#### **Key Turning Points According to McKee**

1. **Inciting Incident**
   - **Purpose**: Acts as the catalyst that disrupts the protagonist’s ordinary world, initiating the central conflict.
   - **Example**: The murder of Bruce Wayne’s parents in _Batman_ serves as the inciting incident that drives his quest for justice.
2. **Progressive Complications**
   - **Purpose**: A series of escalating obstacles and challenges that increase the story's tension and complexity.
   - **Example**: In _Jurassic Park_, the dinosaurs escaping containment introduces progressive complications, heightening the danger for the characters.
3. **Crisis**
   - **Purpose**: The moment of greatest tension where the protagonist faces a critical decision that determines the story's outcome.
   - **Example**: In _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone_, Harry decides to pursue the Sorcerer’s Stone despite the risks, embodying the crisis point.
4. **Climax**
   - **Purpose**: The culmination of the story’s events where the central conflict reaches its peak.
   - **Example**: The final battle between Frodo and Gollum in _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_ represents the climax, determining the fate of the One Ring.

#### **Elaboration and Context**

McKee’s analysis of turning points emphasizes their role in shaping the story's emotional and narrative arc. Each turning point serves as a building block that propels the story forward, ensuring that the protagonist remains engaged in their quest and that the audience remains invested in the outcome. These moments are meticulously planned to create a seamless flow of events that maintain suspense and interest.

#### **Supporting Information**

- **Inciting Incident**: McKee highlights the importance of a strong inciting incident that convincingly propels the protagonist into the story’s main conflict. It should be significant enough to justify the protagonist’s journey and the ensuing challenges.
- **Progressive Complications**: These should be strategically placed to escalate the stakes and deepen the narrative complexity. Each complication should serve a purpose, whether it’s to reveal more about the protagonist, introduce new characters, or complicate the central conflict.
- **Crisis**: The crisis demands a pivotal choice from the protagonist, reflecting their internal growth and setting the stage for the climax. McKee advises that the protagonist's decision should be deeply rooted in their character development.
- **Climax**: As the story's peak, the climax should synthesize all previous events and conflicts, providing a resolution that feels both inevitable and surprising. McKee emphasizes that the climax should deliver a powerful emotional and narrative payoff.

#### **Additional Examples**

- **Inciting Incident**: In _The Hunger Games_, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sister's place, setting the story in motion and establishing the central conflict.
- **Progressive Complications**: In _The Avengers_, the progressive complications involve the increasing threat posed by Loki and his alien army, challenging the Avengers' unity and capabilities.
- **Crisis**: In _Frozen_, Anna faces the crisis when she decides to confront Elsa to save their kingdom, despite the personal risks involved.
- **Climax**: In _Inception_, the climax occurs during the multi-layered dream sequences where Cobb confronts his subconscious and ultimately achieves his goal of returning home.

#### **Application**

By meticulously planning and executing the **inciting incident**, **progressive complications**, **crisis**, and **climax**, writers can craft narratives that build anticipation and deliver impactful resolutions. **Robert McKee's** framework for turning points ensures that each pivotal moment serves a purpose in advancing the story and deepening character development, resulting in a compelling and emotionally resonant narrative.
