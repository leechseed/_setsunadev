### **1. Title: McKee's Turning Points Model**

#### **1.1. Definition**

McKee’s Turning Points Model identifies key moments in a narrative that significantly alter the story’s direction. These turning points—such as the inciting incident, progressive complications, the crisis, and the climax—are pivotal junctures where tension escalates, stakes rise, and the protagonist’s path is reshaped. By strategically placing these moments, writers maintain narrative momentum and ensure continuous audience engagement.
