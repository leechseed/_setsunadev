#### **McKee's Character and Conflict Model**

At the heart of McKee’s philosophy is the belief that **character** and **conflict** are the driving forces of storytelling. He argues that without compelling characters and meaningful conflicts, a story lacks the emotional and psychological depth necessary to engage audiences.

- **Character Arc**: McKee underscores the importance of the protagonist’s transformation throughout the story. A well-crafted character arc involves the protagonist undergoing significant internal and external changes, driven by the conflicts they encounter. This transformation is crucial for creating a satisfying and relatable narrative.

  _Example_: In _The Godfather_, Michael Corleone’s arc from a reluctant outsider to a powerful mafia boss exemplifies profound character transformation.

- **Conflict Types**:

  - **Internal Conflict**: These are the personal struggles and psychological dilemmas faced by a character. Internal conflicts often revolve around moral choices, emotional turmoil, or identity crises.

    _Example_: Hamlet’s indecision and existential angst in Shakespeare’s _Hamlet_ highlight internal conflict.

  - **Personal Conflict**: This involves interpersonal relationships and challenges between characters. It can stem from misunderstandings, power struggles, or conflicting desires.

    _Example_: The rivalry between Scarlett O’Hara and Melanie Hamilton in _Gone with the Wind_ showcases personal conflict.

  - **Extra-Personal Conflict**: These are external forces that act upon the characters, such as societal norms, natural disasters, or fate. Extra-personal conflicts create obstacles that the characters must overcome.

    _Example_: In _The Lord of the Rings_, the characters face the external conflict of battling the forces of Sauron.

McKee’s focus on these conflict types ensures that stories remain dynamic and characters are continuously tested, fostering growth and engagement.

**Elaboration and Context:**

McKee's emphasis on character and conflict aligns with fundamental narrative theory, where the interplay between a character's desires and the obstacles they face drives the story forward. By categorizing conflicts into internal, personal, and extra-personal, McKee provides a nuanced framework for writers to explore different dimensions of storytelling, ensuring that characters are multi-dimensional and their journeys are compelling.

**Supporting Information:**

- **Character Arc**: A well-defined character arc not only enhances the protagonist's relatability but also provides a framework for the story's emotional trajectory. McKee advocates for arcs that reflect genuine human experiences, allowing audiences to connect deeply with the character's journey.

- **Conflict Types**: By distinguishing between internal, personal, and extra-personal conflicts, McKee encourages writers to create layered narratives where different forms of conflict intersect and compound. This complexity adds richness to the story, preventing it from becoming one-dimensional.

**Additional Examples:**

- **Internal Conflict**: In _Black Swan_, Nina's struggle with perfectionism and her psychological descent into madness represent profound internal conflict, driving the narrative's intensity.

- **Personal Conflict**: The tension between Rick and Ilsa in _Casablanca_ exemplifies personal conflict, stemming from their past relationship and conflicting loyalties.

- **Extra-Personal Conflict**: In _Mad Max: Fury Road_, the protagonists face the extra-personal conflict of a dystopian wasteland ruled by tyrannical warlords, creating a high-stakes environment for their survival.

**Application:**

Incorporating multiple types of conflict within a single narrative can heighten tension and deepen character development. For instance, a protagonist might face personal conflict with a rival while simultaneously grappling with internal doubts and battling societal expectations, creating a multifaceted and engaging story.
