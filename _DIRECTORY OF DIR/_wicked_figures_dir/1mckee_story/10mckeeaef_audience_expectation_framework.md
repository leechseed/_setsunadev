## **McKee's Audience Expectation Framework**

In **Robert McKee's** seminal work **"Story"**, the management of **audience expectations** is highlighted as a critical element of successful storytelling. McKee emphasizes that understanding and strategically manipulating these expectations can significantly enhance a story's impact, ensuring that it resonates deeply with its audience. The **Audience Expectation Framework** involves recognizing the inherent assumptions audiences bring to a narrative and leveraging these to create engaging and emotionally satisfying experiences.

#### **Definition and Importance**

**Audience expectations** refer to the preconceived notions and anticipations that viewers, readers, or listeners bring to a story based on factors such as genre, marketing, cultural context, and personal experiences. Managing these expectations effectively allows writers to fulfill audience desires while also providing moments of surprise and innovation that keep the narrative fresh and engaging. **McKee** argues that balancing adherence to and subversion of these expectations is key to maintaining audience interest and delivering a compelling story.

#### **Key Components of McKee's Audience Expectation Framework**

1. **Understanding Genre Conventions**

   - **Purpose**: Recognize the specific themes, character archetypes, plot structures, and stylistic elements that define a genre, as these shape audience expectations.
   - **Application**: Writers should align their narratives with these conventions to meet basic audience anticipations, providing a familiar framework that enhances engagement.
   - **Example**: In the horror genre, audiences expect elements of suspense, fear, and the supernatural, as seen in films like _The Exorcist_.

2. **Subverting Expectations**

   - **Purpose**: Introduce unexpected twists or unconventional character developments that challenge and expand upon traditional genre norms, thereby keeping the audience engaged.
   - **Application**: By creatively subverting genre conventions, writers can offer fresh perspectives and avoid clichéd storytelling, enhancing the story's originality and impact.
   - **Example**: _Get Out_ subverts the horror genre by incorporating social commentary on racism, adding layers of meaning beyond traditional horror tropes.

3. **Genre Fusion**
   - **Purpose**: Combine elements from multiple genres to create unique and multifaceted narratives that appeal to diverse audience tastes.
   - **Application**: Blending genres allows for the creation of hybrid stories that can attract a broader audience and provide more opportunities for innovative storytelling.
   - **Example**: _Blade Runner 2049_ blends science fiction with noir, offering a richly layered narrative that transcends typical genre boundaries.

#### **Elaboration and Context**

**McKee's** perspective on audience expectations underscores the importance of both meeting and challenging what audiences anticipate. While fulfilling genre conventions provides a sense of familiarity and satisfaction, introducing innovative elements that subvert these expectations can create memorable and impactful storytelling moments. This dual approach ensures that narratives remain both accessible and engaging, preventing stagnation and fostering deeper audience investment.

#### **Supporting Information**

- **Respecting Genre Norms**: Adhering to genre conventions helps in establishing a clear narrative direction and meeting the basic expectations that audiences have for a particular genre.
- **Innovative Subversion**: Thoughtful subversion of genre norms can differentiate a story from others in the same category, offering unique experiences that surprise and delight audiences.
- **Hybrid Narratives**: Combining elements from various genres can create rich, multifaceted stories that offer the strengths of each genre while providing a novel narrative experience.

#### **Additional Examples**

- **Genre Conventions**: In the western genre, audiences expect elements like rugged landscapes, frontier justice, and morally ambiguous characters, as exemplified by _Unforgiven_.
- **Subverting Expectations**: _Shaun of the Dead_ subverts the zombie horror genre by infusing it with comedy, creating a unique blend that both honors and redefines genre conventions.
- **Genre Fusion**: _Pan’s Labyrinth_ fuses fantasy with historical drama, weaving magical realism into the grim realities of post-Civil War Spain to create a poignant and visually stunning narrative.

#### **Application**

By thoroughly understanding and strategically managing audience expectations, writers can craft stories that not only meet the foundational desires of their audience but also surprise and engage them in unexpected ways. **McKee's** framework encourages writers to respect genre norms while also exploring innovative approaches, ensuring that their stories remain both familiar and fresh. This balance enhances the overall storytelling experience, making narratives more compelling and emotionally resonant for the audience.
