# **McKee's Definition of Story Framework**

McKee begins by establishing a clear and profound definition of what constitutes a story. He posits that a story is a **structured narrative** that conveys meaning through the intricate interplay of characters, events, and ideas. This definition underscores storytelling as an art form that marries creativity with discipline. For McKee, the essence of a great story lies in its ability to communicate universal truths and evoke deep emotional responses, achieved through carefully crafted narrative structures and character arcs.

**Supporting Information:**

McKee's definition aligns with classical theories of narrative, where structure serves as the backbone that supports the thematic and emotional elements of the story. By emphasizing the structured nature of storytelling, McKee advocates for a balance between spontaneous creativity and deliberate planning. This approach ensures that stories are not only imaginative but also coherent and impactful.

**Additional Context:**

McKee draws inspiration from literary giants like Aristotle, whose _Poetics_ laid the foundational principles of narrative structure. By building on these classical theories, McKee bridges the gap between traditional literary analysis and modern screenwriting practices, making his work both timeless and contemporary.
