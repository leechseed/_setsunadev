**Elaboration and Context:**

Adapting stories across different media requires a nuanced understanding of each medium's storytelling mechanics. McKee’s insights help writers navigate these transitions, ensuring that adaptations are not only faithful to the original but also optimized for their new format.

**Supporting Information:**

- **Interactive Media**: With the rise of video games and interactive storytelling, McKee explores how narratives can be adapted to engage audiences in new and immersive ways, incorporating player choices and branching storylines.

**Additional Examples:**

- **Film Adaptation**: _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone_ was successfully adapted into a film by condensing the extensive world-building of the novel into a visually captivating and coherent narrative suitable for the screen.
