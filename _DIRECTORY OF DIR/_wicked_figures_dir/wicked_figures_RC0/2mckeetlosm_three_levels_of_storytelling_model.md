### **1. Title: McKee's Three Levels of Storytelling Model**

#### **1.1. Definition**

McKee's Three Levels of Storytelling Model delineates storytelling into three distinct yet interdependent levels: Substance, Structure, and Style. Each level contributes to the overall impact and effectiveness of the narrative. This model emphasizes that mastering these three levels enables writers to create stories that are well-constructed, rich in meaning, and emotionally resonant.
