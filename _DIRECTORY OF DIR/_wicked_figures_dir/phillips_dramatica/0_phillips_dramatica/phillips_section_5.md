### **Chapter 3: Story Structure – Classes, Types, Variations, and Elements**

**Core Concept:** A Story’s Structure is Composed of Nested Levels of Conflict and Meaning

#### **Classes (Domains)**

- **Fundamental Conflict Areas:**

  - **Universe (External Situations):** Encompasses conflicts arising from external circumstances, societal structures, or environmental factors. This Class addresses the broad, situational challenges that the characters must navigate.
  - **Physics (Activities):** Focuses on conflicts related to actions, tasks, or processes. This Class deals with the tangible activities and efforts characters undertake to resolve the central problem.
  - **Mind (Fixed Attitudes):** Involves conflicts stemming from characters’ inherent beliefs, ideologies, or mental frameworks. This Class addresses the rigid attitudes that may hinder or facilitate problem-solving.
  - **Psychology (Manipulations):** Pertains to conflicts arising from manipulation, persuasion, or psychological influences. This Class deals with the nuanced, often covert interactions that impact characters’ behaviors and decisions.

- **Distinct Perspectives:**
  - **Unique Angles on Conflict:** Each Class provides a distinct perspective on the central problem, ensuring that the narrative explores the conflict from multiple, complementary angles. This multiplicity enriches the story’s complexity and depth.
  - **Comprehensive Conflict Exploration:** By categorizing conflicts into these broad Classes, Dramatica ensures that the narrative addresses both overt and subtle aspects of the central problem, fostering a well-rounded exploration of the story’s thematic concerns.

#### **Types**

- **Medium-Scale Topics:**

  - **Specific Contextual Focus:** Each Class is subdivided into Types that narrow the focus of conflict, providing a more specific context for narrative exploration. For example, the Physics Class includes Types such as “Understanding,” “Doing,” “Obtaining,” and “Learning,” each contextualizing different aspects of activities and actions.
  - **Enhanced Narrative Precision:** Types allow authors to pinpoint the exact nature of conflicts within each Class, facilitating a more precise and targeted narrative structure. This precision enhances the story’s thematic clarity and coherence.

- **Contextual Specificity:**
  - **Tailored Conflict Contexts:** Types offer tailored contexts that guide the narrative’s exploration of conflict, ensuring that each aspect is examined in detail. This specificity prevents broad, unfocused storytelling, promoting a more nuanced and engaging narrative.
  - **Thematic Direction:** By defining specific Types, authors can steer the narrative’s thematic direction, aligning plot developments and character actions with the story’s overarching themes.

#### **Variations (Theme Elements)**
