### **Internal vs. External Perspectives Framework**

#### **1. Title: Internal vs. External Perspectives Framework**

#### **1.1. Definition**

"Internal vs. External Perspectives" is a comprehensive framework that explores the dual viewpoints through which a narrative can be experienced and analyzed. This framework delineates the subjective, character-focused internal perspective and the objective, broader conflict-oriented external perspective. By balancing these two viewpoints, the framework ensures a multifaceted and balanced storytelling approach that fosters deep audience engagement and a holistic understanding of the narrative's central conflicts and themes.
