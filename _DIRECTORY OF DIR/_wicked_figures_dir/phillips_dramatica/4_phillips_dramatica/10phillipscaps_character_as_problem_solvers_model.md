### **1. Title: Character Construction as Problem-Solvers**

#### **1.1. Definition**

Character Construction as Problem-Solvers is a framework that defines characters based on their essential motivational and functional elements. This model emphasizes the role of characters in addressing and resolving central conflicts within a narrative through diverse problem-solving approaches and functional diversity. The framework aims to enrich storytelling by ensuring that each character contributes uniquely to conflict resolution, fostering a dynamic and multifaceted narrative.

### **2. Key Concepts**

#### **2.1. Character as Problem-Solvers**

- **Definition:**

  This concept focuses on characters being central agents in identifying, addressing, and resolving the central conflicts within a narrative. Each character's approach to problem-solving is shaped by their unique motivational and functional elements, providing varied perspectives and methodologies in conflict resolution.

##### **2.1.1. Components of Character as Problem-Solvers**

###### **2.1.1.1. Embodiment of Elements**

- **Definition:**

  Embodiment of Elements refers to the specific motivational and functional traits assigned to a character that define their unique approach to problem-solving. These elements determine how a character perceives and interacts with the central conflict, ensuring diversity in narrative perspectives.

- **Characteristics:**
  - **Diverse Problem-Solving Approaches:** Characters utilize distinct problem-solving strategies based on their assigned elements, allowing for a range of responses to the central conflict.
  - **Functional Roles in Conflict:** Each character's elements assign them a unique role in addressing the conflict, ensuring that multiple methodologies are employed within the narrative.

###### **2.1.1.2. Functional Diversity**

- **Definition:**

  Functional Diversity emphasizes the variety in roles and methods that characters bring to the narrative. By having characters with different functional elements, the framework ensures a comprehensive and multifaceted exploration of the central conflict.

- **Characteristics:**
  - **Variety in Narrative Roles:** Characters possess different elements that lead to varied problem-solving approaches, preventing a one-dimensional exploration of conflict.
  - **Complementary and Contrasting Methods:** The diversity in functional elements allows characters to both complement each other’s methods and present contrasting approaches, fostering tension and collaboration.

### **3. Implications of Character Construction as Problem-Solvers**

#### **3.1. Enhanced Narrative Depth**

- **Description:**

  By constructing characters with distinct motivational and functional elements, the framework adds layers of complexity to the narrative. Each character's unique approach to problem-solving contributes to a richer and more nuanced story, allowing for deeper engagement with the audience.

#### **3.2. Dynamic Conflict Resolution**

- **Description:**

  The functional diversity among characters leads to dynamic and unpredictable outcomes in conflict resolution. This unpredictability keeps the narrative engaging, as multiple perspectives and methods contribute to the resolution process.

#### **3.3. Facilitated Character Development**

- **Description:**

  The interplay of diverse problem-solving approaches encourages continuous character growth. Characters adapt and evolve in response to the central conflict and their interactions with others, leading to more developed and relatable personas.
