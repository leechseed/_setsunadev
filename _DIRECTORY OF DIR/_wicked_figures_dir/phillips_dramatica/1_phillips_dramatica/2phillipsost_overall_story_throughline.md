### **Chapter 2: The Four Throughlines**

**Core Concept:** Every Complete Story Contains Four Interrelated Perspectives (Throughlines)

#### **Overall Story Throughline**

- **Big Picture Conflict:**

  - **Central Problem Involvement:** This throughline encompasses the primary conflict that involves all characters, setting the stage for the narrative’s main tension. It represents the universal challenge that the story’s characters must collectively address and resolve.
  - **Objective World Presentation:** By focusing on the central problem that affects everyone, the Overall Story Throughline provides a common ground for all characters, ensuring that the main conflict is universally recognized and significant.

- **Collective Perspective:**
  - **Shared Narrative Context:** This perspective establishes the universal stakes and the overarching conflict that binds the characters together. It serves as the foundation upon which individual character stories are built, ensuring that all narrative threads are interconnected.
  - **Universal Stakes:** The overarching conflict defines what is at stake for the entire narrative world, heightening the story’s tension and urgency as characters strive to overcome the central problem.
