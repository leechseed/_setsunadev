#### **Types**

- **Medium-Scale Topics:**

  - **Specific Contextual Focus:** Each Class is subdivided into Types that narrow the focus of conflict, providing a more specific context for narrative exploration. For example, the Physics Class includes Types such as “Understanding,” “Doing,” “Obtaining,” and “Learning,” each contextualizing different aspects of activities and actions.
  - **Enhanced Narrative Precision:** Types allow authors to pinpoint the exact nature of conflicts within each Class, facilitating a more precise and targeted narrative structure. This precision enhances the story’s thematic clarity and coherence.

- **Contextual Specificity:**
  - **Tailored Conflict Contexts:** Types offer tailored contexts that guide the narrative’s exploration of conflict, ensuring that each aspect is examined in detail. This specificity prevents broad, unfocused storytelling, promoting a more nuanced and engaging narrative.
  - **Thematic Direction:** By defining specific Types, authors can steer the narrative’s thematic direction, aligning plot developments and character actions with the story’s overarching themes.
