### **Chapter 3: Story Structure – Classes, Types, Variations, and Elements**

**Core Concept:** A Story’s Structure is Composed of Nested Levels of Conflict and Meaning

#### **Classes (Domains)**

- **Fundamental Conflict Areas:**

  - **Universe (External Situations):** Encompasses conflicts arising from external circumstances, societal structures, or environmental factors. This Class addresses the broad, situational challenges that the characters must navigate.
  - **Physics (Activities):** Focuses on conflicts related to actions, tasks, or processes. This Class deals with the tangible activities and efforts characters undertake to resolve the central problem.
  - **Mind (Fixed Attitudes):** Involves conflicts stemming from characters’ inherent beliefs, ideologies, or mental frameworks. This Class addresses the rigid attitudes that may hinder or facilitate problem-solving.
  - **Psychology (Manipulations):** Pertains to conflicts arising from manipulation, persuasion, or psychological influences. This Class deals with the nuanced, often covert interactions that impact characters’ behaviors and decisions.

- **Distinct Perspectives:**
  - **Unique Angles on Conflict:** Each Class provides a distinct perspective on the central problem, ensuring that the narrative explores the conflict from multiple, complementary angles. This multiplicity enriches the story’s complexity and depth.
  - **Comprehensive Conflict Exploration:** By categorizing conflicts into these broad Classes, Dramatica ensures that the narrative addresses both overt and subtle aspects of the central problem, fostering a well-rounded exploration of the story’s thematic concerns.
