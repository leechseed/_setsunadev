### **Chapter 5: Plot – Signposts and Journeys**

**Core Concept:** Plot Represents the Flow of Problem-Solving Through Stages and Transitions

#### **Signposts**

- **Major Stages:**

  - **Narrative Milestones:** Signposts are fixed points in the narrative that represent significant stages of growth or change within each throughline. These milestones track the progression of the story’s conflict and thematic development.
  - **Structured Progression:** By defining clear Signposts, authors can structure the narrative’s progression methodically, ensuring that each stage of problem-solving is adequately addressed and developed.

- **Four Signposts per Throughline:**
  - **Consistent Framework:** Each throughline is divided into four Signposts (e.g., Understanding, Doing, Obtaining, Learning) that track the evolution of the perspective on the central problem. This consistent framework ensures that each narrative perspective progresses logically and cohesively.
  - **Balanced Development:** The four Signposts provide a balanced development of each throughline, preventing any single stage from becoming overly dominant or neglected within the narrative.
