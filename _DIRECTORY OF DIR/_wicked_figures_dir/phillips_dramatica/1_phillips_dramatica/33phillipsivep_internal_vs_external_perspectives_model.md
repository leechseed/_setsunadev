#### **Internal vs. External Perspectives**

- **Internal View (Subjective):**

  - **Audience Identification:** The internal perspective allows the audience to closely identify with specific characters, primarily the Main Character. This identification fosters empathy and personal investment in the character’s journey and development.
  - **Subjective Narrative Experience:** From this viewpoint, the story is experienced through the emotional and psychological lens of the character, providing an intimate understanding of their motivations, fears, and growth.

- **External View (Objective):**
  - **Broader Conflict Analysis:** The external perspective enables the audience to observe and analyze conflicts that affect all characters collectively. This viewpoint provides a macro-level understanding of the story’s central problem and its implications on the entire narrative world.
  - **Balanced Narrative Structure:** By maintaining both internal and external perspectives, Dramatica ensures that the story remains balanced, offering both personal and universal dimensions of conflict and resolution.
