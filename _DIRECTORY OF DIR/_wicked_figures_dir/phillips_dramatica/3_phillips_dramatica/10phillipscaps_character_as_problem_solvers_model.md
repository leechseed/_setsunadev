### **2. Key Concepts**

#### **2.1. Character as Problem-Solvers**

- **Definition:**

  This concept focuses on characters being central agents in identifying, addressing, and resolving the central conflicts within a narrative. Each character's approach to problem-solving is shaped by their unique motivational and functional elements, providing varied perspectives and methodologies in conflict resolution.

##### **2.1.1. Components of Character as Problem-Solvers**

###### **2.1.1.1. Embodiment of Elements**

- **Definition:**

  Embodiment of Elements refers to the specific motivational and functional traits assigned to a character that define their unique approach to problem-solving. These elements determine how a character perceives and interacts with the central conflict, ensuring diversity in narrative perspectives.

- **Characteristics:**
  - **Diverse Problem-Solving Approaches:** Characters utilize distinct problem-solving strategies based on their assigned elements, allowing for a range of responses to the central conflict.
  - **Functional Roles in Conflict:** Each character's elements assign them a unique role in addressing the conflict, ensuring that multiple methodologies are employed within the narrative.

###### **2.1.1.2. Functional Diversity**
