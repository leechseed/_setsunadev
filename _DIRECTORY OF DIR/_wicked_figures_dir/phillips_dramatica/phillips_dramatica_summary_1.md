**Dramatica: A New Theory of Story** by Melanie Anne Phillips and Chris Huntley presents a comprehensive framework for understanding and constructing narratives. The theory posits that a story is a representation of a problem being solved by characters within a structured mental model, akin to the workings of a human mind. This overview provides a chapter-by-chapter breakdown, highlighting the most important concepts and delving into their constituent parts.

  - **Quadrants**: The mind is divided into four quadrants—Objective, Subjective, Physical, and Mental—each representing different perspectives.
  - **Functional Roles**: Characters fulfill specific roles that correspond to mental functions, such as the Protagonist, Antagonist, and various other archetypes.

- **Unified Theory**: Unlike other narrative theories, Dramatica offers a unified approach that integrates plot, character, theme, and genre.
  - **Interconnected Elements**: All story components are interdependent, ensuring coherence and depth.
  - **Structural Framework**: Provides a blueprint for story development, ensuring all necessary elements are addressed.
