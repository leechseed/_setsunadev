#### **Holistic Representation**

- **Facets of the Mental Process:**

  - **Comprehensive Symbolism:** Every narrative element—characters, plot points, themes, and conflicts—symbolizes different aspects of the human mental process. This symbolism ensures that the story operates as a cohesive unit, with each element contributing to the overall cognitive model.
  - **Interdependence of Elements:** Characters, plot developments, and thematic explorations are interdependent, reflecting the interconnected nature of human thought and emotion. This interdependence fosters a narrative that is both structurally sound and thematically rich.

- **Balanced Storytelling:**
  - **Ensuring Coherence and Depth:** By treating narrative elements as components of a single mind, Dramatica ensures that the story maintains coherence and depth. This method prevents disjointed or superficial storytelling, promoting a narrative that thoughtfully engages with its central conflict.
  - **Thematic Richness:** The holistic approach allows for the exploration of complex themes and moral questions, enhancing the story’s intellectual and emotional resonance with the audience.
