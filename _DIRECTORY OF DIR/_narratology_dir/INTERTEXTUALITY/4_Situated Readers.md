### Entities and Relationships
- **Entity Name**: Harold Bloom
  - **Description**: A literary critic known for his theory of the 'Anxiety of Influence' which focuses on the intertextual relationships between poets and their predecessors.
  - **Relationship Type**: Influence
  - **Description**: Bloom's theory posits that poets are influenced by predecessors but must misread them to create original work.

- **Entity Name**: Romantic Poets
  - **Description**: Nineteenth-century poets known for their emphasis on imagination and unique vision.
  - **Relationship Type**: Return
  - **Description**: Despite their originality, Romantic poets consistently return to Milton, showing the inevitability of intertextual influence.

- **Entity Name**: Intertextuality
  - **Description**: The relationship between texts where one text is shaped by its relationship to previous texts.
  - **Relationship Type**: Conflict
  - **Description**: For Bloom, intertextuality involves conflict between the desire to be original and the inevitable influence of previous works.

### Short Summaries
1. **Harold Bloom's literary criticism is deeply entrenched in the concept of intertextuality, particularly through his study of Romantic poetry and its unavoidable return to earlier works like those of Milton.**
2. **Bloom's theory, the 'Anxiety of Influence', describes how poets struggle with the precursors' influence to achieve originality, often through misreading and transforming the precursor's work.**

### Style
- **Analytical, Interpretive, Theoretical**

### Arguments
1. **Bloom's theory is influenced by psychoanalytical concepts, particularly the Oedipus Complex, to explain the dynamic between poets and their predecessors.**
2. **The concept of 'belatedness' suggests that poets are always late to the original poetic event, notably represented by Milton for Romantic poets.**
3. **Bloom introduces the idea that the act of reading itself is influenced by previous readings, making original interpretation nearly impossible.**
4. **Bloom argues that all literary creation is essentially a misreading of previous works, a defensive act against the overwhelming influence of precursor poets.**
5. **His method of 'Antithetical Criticism' seeks to avoid both the reductive and tautological pitfalls of traditional literary criticism.**

### Summary
**Harold Bloom's contributions to literary theory emphasize the intertextual nature of literature, particularly through his concept of the 'Anxiety of Influence'. This theory posits that poets engage in a complex psychological struggle with their predecessors, often manifesting as a conflict between the desire to emulate and the need to establish originality. Bloom's analysis, deeply rooted in psychoanalytical frameworks, suggests that every poetic act involves a misreading or transformation of previous texts, which is a defensive mechanism against the daunting presence of influential earlier works. His unique approach to literary criticism challenges the notions of textual autonomy and originality, arguing instead that every text is a response to and a transformation of earlier texts, highlighting the perpetual cycle of influence and reinterpretation in literature.**

- **Entity Name**: Harold Bloom
  - **Description**: Literary critic known for his 'Anxiety of Influence' theory, emphasizing the inevitable influence of precursor poets on modern poets.
  - **Relationship Type**: Critique
  - **Description**: Bloom's approach is critiqued for its narrow focus on literary texts as intertexts and neglect of broader cultural and social contexts.

- **Entity Name**: Intertextuality
  - **Description**: Concept that all texts are inherently interconnected and influence one another.
  - **Relationship Type**: Expansion

- **Entity Name**: Feminist Criticism
  - **Description**: Literary criticism that explores the writings of women and the cultural stereotypes in literary traditions.
  - **Relationship Type**: Advocacy
  - **Description**: Feminist critics advocate for recognizing a broader spectrum of intertexts, including cultural and social influences.

### Short Summaries
1. **Bloom’s theories on intertextuality suggest that all modern literary creation is a misreading influenced by earlier works, a concept rooted in psychoanalytic theory.**
2. **Critics argue that Bloom's focus on literary texts as the primary source of intertextual relationships is too restrictive, neglecting the influence of broader cultural and societal factors.**

### Style
- **Critical, Analytical, Scholarly**

### Arguments
1. **Bloom's model reduces the complex field of literary influences to a simplistic binary between the precursor and the ephebe, ignoring other cultural and societal factors.**
2. **Critics suggest that Bloom's approach is circular, where his theory seems only verifiable through his own interpretative practice.**
3. **Feminist critics challenge Bloom's narrow literary focus, advocating for an inclusion of broader intertextual fields that consider gender and social contexts.**
4. **Gynocriticism seeks to establish a distinct female literary tradition, highlighting the need for a more inclusive understanding of intertextual relationships.**
5. **The exclusion of women from traditional literary canons is a significant oversight in Bloom's theory, suggesting a need for a more expansive view of literary history.**

### Summary
**Harold Bloom’s theory of intertextuality, centered around the 'Anxiety of Influence', posits that all literary creation is fundamentally influenced by previous works, leading to a cycle of misreading and reinterpretation. This theory has been critiqued for its limited focus on direct literary predecessors, neglecting the broader cultural, social, and gender contexts that also shape texts. Feminist critics, particularly through the approach of gynocriticism, challenge this narrow view by advocating for an expanded intertextual framework that includes not just literary texts but also the cultural codes and stereotypes that influence writing. This broader perspective not only questions the exclusivity of traditional literary canons but also promotes a more inclusive understanding of literary history that recognizes the contributions of marginalized groups.**

### Entities and Relationships
- **Entity Name**: Gilbert and Gubar
  - **Description**: Feminist critics who explored nineteenth-century women's literature in "The Madwoman in the Attic".
  - **Relationship Type**: Critique
  - **Description**: They critique Bloom's patriarchal perspective by exploring how it partially aligns with women writers' experiences but ultimately diverges due to different societal pressures and motivations.

- **Entity Name**: Anxiety of Authorship
  - **Description**: Concept introduced by Gilbert and Gubar to describe the unique pressures faced by women writers.
  - **Relationship Type**: Contrast
  - **Description**: Contrasts with Bloom's "Anxiety of Influence", emphasizing the fear of writing itself due to societal constraints on women, rather than fear of not surpassing literary precursors.

- **Entity Name**: Intertextuality
  - **Description**: The text's relation to cultural and literary traditions.
  - **Relationship Type**: Application
  - **Description**: In feminist criticism, intertextuality is used to uncover hidden connections between women writers and challenge patriarchal interpretations of literary history.

### Short Summaries
1. **Gilbert and Gubar acknowledge some validity in Bloom's theory concerning the motivations behind writing but argue that the 'Anxiety of Influence' is less relevant to women writers, who face 'Anxiety of Authorship' due to societal restrictions.**
2. **Their work reveals how nineteenth-century women writers navigated patriarchal barriers by adopting male pseudonyms or conforming superficially to feminine ideals while subtly challenging them through themes like madness.**

### Style
- **Critical, Insightful, Scholarly**

### Arguments
1. **Gilbert and Gubar expand the discussion of literary influence to include societal and cultural pressures, particularly those constraining women writers.**
2. **They argue that the traditional symbolic association of the pen with the phallus excludes women from the literary tradition, necessitating different symbolic representations for women's writing.**
3. **The notion of 'mad intertextuality' suggests that women's texts are interconnected not only with each other but with broader cultural and scientific discourses, complicating the traditional narrative of literary influence.**
4. **Feminist critics like Toril Moi challenge the simplification of female literary traditions into feminist self-expression, advocating for a nuanced understanding of women's diverse roles and identities in literature.**
5. **The approach to feminist reading and criticism involves reevaluating intertextuality and influence to highlight how gender impacts literary production and interpretation.**

### Summary
**Gilbert and Gubar's feminist critique of Harold Bloom's theory in "The Madwoman in the Attic" revises the concept of literary anxiety from an 'Anxiety of Influence' specific to men to an 'Anxiety of Authorship' that addresses the unique challenges faced by women writers. They argue that societal limitations on women's roles and expressions lead to a different kind of literary creation, one that must subtly navigate and often subvert patriarchal norms. By employing the concept of intertextuality, they link women writers across time and space, suggesting that understanding these connections requires considering broader cultural, ideological, and historical contexts. This approach not only challenges the traditional literary canon but also encourages a reevaluation of how literary history is constructed and understood, particularly in terms of gender dynamics.**

2. **Rhys's text is seen as a feminist and postcolonial critique that challenges traditional narratives and roles imposed on women and colonized peoples.**

### Style
- **Analytical, Critical, Postcolonial, Feminist**

### Arguments
1. **Spivak argues that Rhys uses intertextuality to expose and critique the imperialist and patriarchal underpinnings of British literary tradition.**
2. **The novel's conclusion is read as an allegory for the broader experience of colonial subjects who are forced into roles that sustain the colonial enterprise.**
3. **Rhys's narrative strategy involves a reclamation of agency for Antoinette, challenging her traditional portrayal as the madwoman in Brontë's "Jane Eyre."**
4. **The feminist and postcolonial reinterpretation of canonical texts can provide new insights and perspectives that challenge traditional readings.**
5. **By focusing on Antoinette’s perspective, Rhys not only questions the historical silencing of colonial subjects but also foregrounds the complexities of identity and resistance in postcolonial contexts.**

### Summary
**Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's analysis of Jean Rhys's "Wide Sargasso Sea" explores the novel's powerful intertextual connections to Charlotte Brontë’s "Jane Eyre." Spivak interprets the conclusion of Rhys’s novel as a deliberate subversion of the colonial narrative, where Antoinette, the protagonist, reclaims her narrative agency by setting fire to the house, symbolically disrupting the imperial and patriarchal structures upheld in "Jane Eyre." This act serves as both a personal and political allegory, highlighting the broader implications of colonialism and the objectification of women. Through this lens, Rhys's work is seen not just as a response to Brontë but as a broader critique of the roles traditionally assigned to women and colonized peoples in literature.**

2. **The reinterpretation of these myths within a feminist framework challenges the patriarchal underpinnings of widely accepted literary theories.**
3. **Intertextuality, as discussed by Miller, should include a more robust consideration of gender to truly understand the dynamics of literary influence and creation.**
4. **The discussion around these myths serves as a metaphor for the broader struggle of women to be recognized as legitimate and independent voices in literature and art.**
5. **By reevaluating these stories, feminist theorists can assert the importance of women's perspectives and challenge the traditional narratives that have dominated literary discussions.**

### Summary
**Hillis Miller's critique of traditional intertextual theory using the myths of Arachne and Ariadne emphasizes the need for a gendered perspective in literary analysis.
