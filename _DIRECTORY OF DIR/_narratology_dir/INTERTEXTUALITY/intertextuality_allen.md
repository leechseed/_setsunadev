2. **M. M. Bakhtin**: Russian literary theorist known for his theories on the social context of language and its impact on literature. Bakhtin's ideas are pivotal for understanding the dialogic nature of texts.
3. **Julia Kristeva**: Bulgarian-French philosopher and literary critic who first coined the term "intertextuality." Kristeva's work blends Saussurean and Bakhtinian theories to explore how texts influence each other.

**Short Summaries**:

**Arguments**:
1. Intertextuality is a critical framework that challenges the traditional isolated view of textual meaning.
2. The term has been variably defined and is used differently across different schools of thought.
3. Intertextuality suggests that meaning in texts is not inherent but is derived from their relationship to other texts.
4. The concept has significant implications for understanding authorship and the role of the reader in creating meaning.
5. Despite its widespread use, the term "intertextuality" requires careful consideration of its varied and often contradictory interpretations.

**Detailed Summary**:
The introduction to intertextuality provided in this text explores its origins in 20th-century linguistics, particularly through the work of Ferdinand de Saussure and further developments by M. M. Bakhtin. The book delves into how Julia Kristeva first articulated the concept, blending linguistic theories to describe how texts interact with each other. This foundation sets the stage for exploring the term's evolution from a linguistic concept to a broader cultural and theoretical framework. The book critically examines how intertextuality has been employed in various theoretical approaches, from structuralism to poststructuralism, highlighting the contrast in how these approaches utilize the term. It also addresses the term's application in non-literary contexts and its relevance in contemporary cultural and media studies. By tracing intertextuality's development and its impact on literary criticism, the text aims to provide a comprehensive overview of this complex and multifaceted concept.
