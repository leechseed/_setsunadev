# General Model of Narratology Theoretical Concepts

## 1. **Narrative Structure**
### 1.1. **Fabula**
- **Vladimir Propp**: In *"Morphology of the Folktale,"* Propp distinguished between the chronological sequence of events (fabula) and the way they are presented (sjuzhet), emphasizing the importance of the underlying structure of events in folktales.
- **Roland Barthes**: In *"Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives,"* Barthes discussed the importance of distinguishing between the chronological sequence of events (fabula) and the narrative discourse (sjuzhet), emphasizing that the fabula serves as the raw material for narrative construction.

- **Roland Barthes**: In *"S/Z,"* Barthes examined how sjuzhet shapes the reader's understanding of a narrative, exploring the codes and conventions that guide narrative construction and interpretation.
- **Mikhail Bakhtin**: Bakhtin's work on the novel, particularly in *"The Dialogic Imagination,"* touches on how narrative structure (sjuzhet) can shape the meaning and interpretation of events within a story, emphasizing the importance of narrative discourse.
- **Seymour Chatman**: In *"Story and Discourse,"* Chatman analyzed how the sjuzhet, or the structured presentation of events, influences the perception of the fabula, contributing to the overall narrative experience.

### 1.3. **Plot**
- **Aristotle**: In *"Poetics,"* Aristotle laid the foundation for the understanding of plot as a central element of narrative structure, focusing on how the arrangement of events leads to a coherent and compelling story.
- **E.M. Forster**: In *"Aspects of the Novel,"* Forster distinguished between story and plot, arguing that plot involves a deeper understanding of causality and the connection between events, rather than just a sequence of events.
- **Freytag’s Pyramid**: Gustav Freytag's analysis of dramatic structure, known as Freytag's Pyramid, focuses on the development of plot through exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement, offering a structural approach to understanding plot dynamics.
- **Robert McKee**: In *"Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting,"* McKee elaborated on the importance of plot in storytelling, emphasizing the need for a structured approach to narrative construction in film and literature.

### 1.4. **Narrative Logic**
- **David Herman**: In *"Story Logic: Problems and Possibilities of Narrative,"* Herman explored how narrative logic functions within stories, focusing on the cognitive processes that enable readers to understand and interpret narratives.
- **Claude Lévi-Strauss**: Lévi-Strauss’s structuralist approach, particularly in *"The Structural Study of Myth,"* emphasized the logic inherent in narrative structures, exploring how myths and stories follow certain logical patterns.
- **Meir Sternberg**: In *"The Poetics of Biblical Narrative,"* Sternberg analyzed how narrative logic operates within the biblical texts, demonstrating how the structure and presentation of events guide the reader's interpretation.
- **Wayne C. Booth**: In *"The Rhetoric of Fiction,"* Booth discussed the importance of narrative logic in guiding the reader’s understanding of a story, focusing on how the author’s choices in structure and narration influence the coherence and persuasiveness of the narrative.

### 1.5. **Temporal Structures**
- **Paul Ricoeur**: In *"Time and Narrative,"* Ricoeur explored the relationship between time and narrative structure, focusing on how temporal manipulation within a narrative (e.g., flashbacks, foreshadowing) shapes the reader's experience and understanding.
- **Gerard Genette**: Genette's work on anachrony in *"Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method,"* particularly his analysis of order, duration, and frequency, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding temporal structures in narratives.
- **Frank Kermode**: In *"The Sense of an Ending,"* Kermode examined how temporal structures influence the way stories are perceived, particularly focusing on the importance of endings in shaping the overall meaning of a narrative.
- **H. Porter Abbott**: In *"The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative,"* Abbott discussed various temporal structures, including linear and non-linear narratives, and how these affect the reader's perception and interpretation of the story.

### 1.6. **Narrative Time**
- **Mikhail Bakhtin**: In *"Forms of Time and Chronotope in the Novel,"* Bakhtin introduced the concept of the chronotope, which explores the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships in narratives, emphasizing how narrative time is constructed.
- **Paul Ricoeur**: In *"Time and Narrative,"* Ricoeur extensively analyzed the concept of narrative time, exploring how the structure of time within a narrative influences its interpretation and meaning.
- **Julia Kristeva**: In *"The Semiotic and the Symbolic,"* Kristeva discussed the concept of intertextuality and how narrative time can be understood through the interaction of different temporal layers within a text.
- **Hayden White**: In *"Metahistory,"* White explored the role of narrative time in historical writing, arguing that the way events are temporally structured within a narrative shapes the reader’s understanding of history.

## 2. **Liminal Signals**

### 2.1. **Focalization**
- **Gérard Genette**: In *"Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method,"* Genette introduced the concept of focalization, which he used to explore how narratives mediate between the story world and the reader’s perception. By distinguishing between who sees (focalization) and who speaks (narration), Genette highlighted how focalization serves as a liminal point, mediating the reader's access to characters' internal worlds and shaping the indirect transmission of narrative information. This creates a threshold through which the narrative’s meaning is both filtered and interpreted, requiring the reader to navigate these shifting perspectives.
- **Mieke Bal**: In *"Narratology: Introduction to the Theory of Narrative,"* Bal built upon Genette's ideas, emphasizing the importance of focalization as a tool for understanding how narratives construct meaning in the spaces between what is shown and what is hidden. Bal’s work focuses on how focalization allows different layers of a narrative to interact, creating a multi-dimensional experience that requires interpretation as the reader encounters various narrative signals and perspectives.
- **Manfred Jahn**: In his contributions to the *"Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory,"* Jahn explored the cognitive aspects of focalization, discussing how readers process and interpret the focalization of narrative elements. He emphasized the liminal nature of focalization as a boundary space where the reader's interpretation is shaped by the indirect presentation of characters’ thoughts and experiences. This cognitive interaction highlights the role of focalization as a signal that bridges the gap between the narrative’s internal dynamics and the reader’s understanding.
- **Dorrit Cohn**: In *"Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction,"* Cohn analyzed how internal focalization, or the narrative’s access to a character’s thoughts and emotions, serves as a liminal space where the internal and external worlds of characters intersect. Cohn’s exploration of free indirect discourse and other narrative techniques reveals how focalization operates on the edge of direct and indirect communication, allowing readers to interpret the narrative’s deeper meanings through subtle shifts in perspective.

### 2.2. **Perspective**
- **Wayne C. Booth**: In *"The Rhetoric of Fiction,"* Booth examined the role of the narrator’s perspective in shaping the reliability and ethical dimensions of a narrative. He introduced the concept of the implied author, an indirect narrative presence that guides the reader’s interpretation without being explicitly present in the text. This concept underscores the liminal nature of narrative perspective, as the reader must navigate between the expressed words of the narrator and the unspoken intentions of the implied author, interpreting signals that are often only subtly conveyed.
- **Franz Stanzel**: Stanzel, in *"A Theory of Narrative,"* developed a typology of narrative situations that emphasized the interplay between different narrative perspectives. He categorized narratives into various modes based on how the story is presented to the reader, highlighting the liminal role of perspective as a mediator between the narrative’s internal world and the reader’s external interpretation. Stanzel’s work demonstrates how the choice of perspective can create a space where different narrative voices and identities intersect, requiring the reader to interpret these interactions.
- **Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan**: In *"Narrative Fiction: Contemporary Poetics,"* Rimmon-Kenan explored the relationship between focalization and narrative reliability, particularly how different perspectives shape the reader's interpretation of events. She emphasized the role of perspective as a liminal space where the reader must navigate between what is shown and what is inferred, interpreting the narrative’s meaning through the indirect signals provided by the narrator’s perspective.
- **Barbara Herrnstein Smith**: In *"Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End,"* Smith examined how narrative perspective contributes to the overall coherence and closure of a narrative. She discussed how the perspective from which a narrative is told can influence the reader's expectations and interpretations, creating a liminal space where the narrative’s meaning is negotiated between the text and the reader’s understanding. This negotiation requires the reader to interpret the signals embedded in the narrative’s perspective, which often guide them toward an intended, but not explicitly stated, conclusion.

### 2.3. **Dialogism**
- **Mikhail Bakhtin**: In *"The Dialogic Imagination,"* Bakhtin introduced the concept of dialogism, which posits that all narratives are composed of multiple voices and perspectives that interact and influence each other. Bakhtin’s idea of dialogism suggests that meaning is created in the liminal space between these voices, as they engage in a dialogue that is never fully resolved. This interaction between voices represents a form of indirect communication, where the reader must interpret the signals and tensions between different narrative identities to grasp the deeper meaning of the text.
- **Julia Kristeva**: Kristeva expanded on Bakhtin's concept of dialogism in her theory of intertextuality, which she articulated in *"The Kristeva Reader."* She argued that all texts are in dialogue with one another, creating a network of meanings that are transmitted across time and space. This intertextual dialogue occurs in a liminal space where the boundaries between texts blur, requiring the reader to interpret the signals and connections between them. Kristeva’s work highlights how the interaction of different textual voices and identities generates new meanings that transcend the individual texts.
- **Tzvetan Todorov**: In *"Mikhail Bakhtin: The Dialogical Principle,"* Todorov analyzed Bakhtin’s ideas on dialogism and their implications for understanding narrative as a dynamic, interactive process. He emphasized that the meaning of a narrative emerges from the interaction of multiple voices and perspectives, which coexist in a liminal space where their differences are both highlighted and negotiated. This dialogic interaction requires the reader to interpret the signals and tensions between these voices, leading to a richer understanding of the narrative’s complexity.
- **Gérard Genette**: In *"Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation,"* Genette explored how elements outside the main narrative text (paratexts) contribute to the dialogic interaction between the author, text, and reader. He argued that these paratextual elements—such as titles, prefaces, and illustrations—operate in a liminal space between the text and its reception, guiding the reader’s interpretation and framing the narrative’s meaning. Genette’s work underscores the importance of interpreting the indirect signals provided by paratexts, which play a crucial role in shaping the dialogue between the narrative and its audience.

### 2.4. **Characterization**
- **Henry James**: In his novels and essays on the art of fiction, Henry James pioneered the use of narrative perspective and psychological depth in characterization. He argued that a character's interiority—what they think, feel, and perceive—should be central to the narrative, and that this interiority is often conveyed indirectly through the narrative's perspective. James’s approach to characterization highlights the liminal space between a character’s external actions and internal thoughts, requiring readers to interpret subtle signals to fully understand the character’s motivations and complexities.
- **Mikhail Bakhtin**: In *"Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics,"* Bakhtin explored how characterization is shaped by the polyphonic nature of the narrative, where characters’ voices and perspectives interact and influence each other. Bakhtin’s concept of polyphony suggests that characters exist in a liminal space where their identities are not fixed but are constantly being negotiated through their interactions with other characters. This dynamic requires the reader to interpret the signals and dialogues between characters to grasp their evolving identities and roles within the narrative.
- **E.M. Forster**: In *"Aspects of the Novel,"* Forster distinguished between flat and round characters, emphasizing the importance of character development and depth in creating a compelling narrative. He argued that round characters, who possess complex and evolving personalities, often reveal themselves indirectly through their actions, dialogue, and interactions with other characters. Forster’s distinction between flat and round characters underscores the liminal nature of characterization, where readers must interpret the signals provided by the narrative to understand the full depth of a character’s identity.
- **Seymour Chatman**: In *"Story and Discourse,"* Chatman analyzed the role of characterization within the broader context of narrative structure. He focused on how characters are constructed through both their actions (story) and the way they are presented (discourse), emphasizing the importance of indirect characterization. Chatman’s work highlights how the reader must navigate the liminal space between what is shown and what is implied, interpreting the signals embedded in the narrative’s discourse to fully understand the characters’ complexities.

### 2.5. **Polyphony**
- **Mikhail Bakhtin**: Bakhtin’s concept of polyphony, as detailed in *"The Dialogic Imagination,"* describes a narrative that contains a multiplicity of independent and unmerged voices, each with its own perspective and truth. In such narratives, meaning is not imposed by a single authoritative voice but emerges from the interaction of these diverse voices. This creates a liminal space where the reader must interpret the interplay of voices to grasp the narrative’s full meaning, making the process of understanding inherently dialogic and interpretive.
- **Julia Kristeva**: In *"The Kristeva Reader,"* Kristeva expanded on the concept of polyphony by discussing how multiple voices and perspectives within a narrative contribute to its complexity and richness. She linked this idea to her theory of intertextuality, suggesting that a text’s meaning is constructed through the interaction of various voices across different texts and contexts. This polyphonic interaction occurs in a liminal space where the reader must engage with and interpret the overlapping signals and voices to uncover the deeper layers of meaning.
- **David Lodge**: In *"The Art of Fiction,"* Lodge discussed the use of polyphony in modernist literature, particularly in the works of authors like James Joyce and Virginia Woolf. He argued that these authors employed multiple narrative voices to create a layered and nuanced narrative experience, where meaning is generated through the interaction of these voices. Lodge’s analysis highlights how polyphony creates a liminal space in which the reader must interpret the signals and tensions between different voices to fully understand the narrative’s complexity.
- **Tzvetan Todorov**: In *"Mikhail Bakhtin: The Dialogical Principle,"* Todorov elaborated on Bakhtin's concept of polyphony, emphasizing its importance in understanding the interaction of voices within a narrative. Todorov argued that polyphonic narratives create a space where different voices coexist without being fully reconciled, requiring the reader to navigate and interpret the unresolved tensions between these voices. This interpretive process takes place in a liminal space, where the reader is engaged in a dynamic interaction with the narrative’s multiple identities.

## 3. **Reader Interaction**

### 3.1. **Reader Response**
- **Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan**: In *"Narrative Fiction: Contemporary Poetics,"* Rimmon-Kenan argued that the narrative's structure, particularly through focalization and narrative gaps, actively guides the reader’s response. She emphasized the co-creative role of the reader, who must engage with the text’s cues and fill in the narrative gaps to construct meaning. This process highlights the liminal space where the narrative and reader meet, requiring interpretation and imaginative engagement to bring the story to life.
- **Stanley Fish**: In *"Is There a Text in This Class?"* Fish introduced the concept of interpretive communities, suggesting that readers' responses are shaped by their social and cultural contexts. He argued that meaning is not inherent in the text but is constructed through the reader’s interaction with it, influenced by their community’s norms and expectations. This perspective emphasizes the fluid and dynamic nature of reader response, where interpretation varies across different contexts.
- **Wolfgang Iser**: In *"The Act of Reading,"* Iser explored how readers engage with texts through a process of "gap-filling," where the narrative provides clues, but the reader’s imagination completes the story. He highlighted the active role of the reader in constructing meaning, arguing that reading is not a passive activity but a participatory process where the reader co-creates the narrative by interpreting its gaps and ambiguities.
- **Roland Barthes**: In *"The Death of the Author,"* Barthes argued that the reader’s interpretation plays a central role in the creation of meaning. He proposed that once a text is written, it is the reader who "writes" the narrative through their interpretation, effectively "killing" the author’s control over the text. Barthes emphasized the liberation of the text from authorial intent, allowing for a multiplicity of interpretations driven by the reader’s engagement.

### 3.2. **Reader Interpretation**
- **Wayne C. Booth**: In *"The Rhetoric of Fiction,"* Booth explored how narrative techniques such as unreliable narration and the implied author influence the reader's interpretation. He argued that these techniques engage the reader’s moral and ethical judgment, shaping their understanding of the narrative’s truth and reliability. Booth’s work highlights the interpretive process as one where the reader must navigate the layers of narrative discourse to uncover the intended meaning, influenced by their own values and beliefs.
- **Marie-Laure Ryan**: In *"Narrative as Virtual Reality"* and *"Avatars of Story,"* Ryan investigated how digital and virtual narratives transform reader interaction by offering participatory experiences where the reader’s choices directly impact the narrative’s outcome. She argued that these interactive narratives require a new form of interpretation, where the reader’s role extends beyond passive reception to active participation, blurring the lines between author, text, and reader.
- **Umberto Eco**: In *"The Role of the Reader,"* Eco discussed the concept of "open texts," which are designed to be interpreted in multiple ways. He argued that these texts require the reader to actively participate in constructing meaning, as the narrative’s meaning is not fixed but is created through the reader’s engagement with its ambiguities and gaps. Eco’s work underscores the importance of interpretation as a collaborative process between text and reader, where meaning is negotiated rather than predetermined.
- **Susan Sontag**: In *"Against Interpretation,"* Sontag critiqued the dominance of interpretation in modern culture, arguing that it often detracts from the direct experience of art. However, she acknowledged that interpretation is an inevitable part of engaging with texts, highlighting the tension between experiencing a narrative and analyzing its deeper meanings. Sontag’s work emphasizes the dual role of the reader as both an experiencer and an interpreter of narratives.

### 3.3. **Cognitive Approaches**
- **David Herman**: In *"Story Logic: Problems and Possibilities of Narrative,"* Herman developed cognitive narratology to explore how narratives are processed by the human mind. He argued that narratives function as cognitive tools that help readers organize and make sense of their experiences. Herman emphasized that understanding a narrative involves engaging with its structure at a cognitive level, where readers actively interpret and construct meaning based on their mental models and prior knowledge.
- **H. Porter Abbott**: In *"The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative,"* Abbott explored the intersection of cognitive science and narrative theory, suggesting that narratives are deeply rooted in human cognition. He argued that narratives shape and reflect how we think, perceive, and understand the world, highlighting the cognitive processes involved in interpreting stories. Abbott’s work emphasizes the role of narrative as a cognitive framework that guides the reader’s interpretation and engagement with the text.
- **Lisa Zunshine**: In *"Why We Read Fiction: Theory of Mind and the Novel,"* Zunshine examined how readers use their theory of mind—our ability to attribute thoughts and emotions to others—to engage with fictional characters. She argued that this cognitive process is central to how readers interpret and understand narratives, as it allows them to infer characters’ motivations and anticipate their actions. Zunshine’s work highlights the cognitive dimension of narrative interpretation, where understanding a story involves simulating the mental states of its characters.
- **Patrick Colm Hogan**: In *"Cognitive Science, Literature, and the Arts,"* Hogan analyzed how cognitive principles shape the way readers process and engage with narratives. He argued that narrative structures resonate with readers because they align with universal cognitive patterns, such as those related to emotion, memory, and perception. Hogan’s work provides a cognitive explanation for why certain narrative techniques and themes are effective, emphasizing the deep connection between cognitive processes and narrative interpretation.


**Proposition:**  
- **The most effective way to study narrative across all fields of study is through a universal framework known as the "General Model of Narratology." This model provides a comprehensive and standardized approach for analyzing the structures, functions, and roles within narratives, allowing for consistent interpretation and application across diverse disciplines, from literature and history to science and technology.**

### Validation of the Role of Reader Interaction in the General Model of Narratology

1. **Engagement with Texts Across Diverse Disciplines**  
   - **Reader Interaction** is essential for applying the *General Model of Narratology* because it acknowledges the active role of the reader in constructing meaning across all disciplines. In fields like history, literature, and even science, interpretation is not solely determined by the content of the narrative but also by how the reader engages with it. As **Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan** and **Stanley Fish** argued, reader response is shaped by the reader’s cultural, historical, and social contexts, meaning that narratives can be understood differently depending on who is engaging with them. By integrating *Reader Interaction* into the model, the framework allows for these contextual variations while maintaining a consistent structural approach.

2. **Interpretive Flexibility**  
   - **Reader Interpretation** plays a crucial role in making the *General Model of Narratology* a flexible framework. **Umberto Eco** and **Marie-Laure Ryan** explored how narratives, especially in open and interactive forms such as digital and virtual storytelling, require readers to fill in gaps and make choices that influence the outcome of the narrative. This flexibility is essential for a universal framework because it allows for application across disciplines that deal with non-linear or evolving narratives, such as modern media, gaming, or even scientific storytelling (e.g., case studies, medical narratives, or scientific scenarios). A fixed model without *Reader Interpretation* would be too rigid to account for the diverse ways in which people experience narratives.

3. **Cognitive Grounding**  
   - **Cognitive Approaches** provide the psychological and neurological underpinning necessary for the *General Model of Narratology* to be applicable to a wide range of fields. **David Herman** and **Lisa Zunshine** argue that the way narratives are processed cognitively affects interpretation and memory. For example, in fields like education or science, understanding how the brain processes complex narrative structures can be invaluable for presenting information in ways that are accessible and memorable to diverse audiences. By incorporating *Cognitive Approaches*, the model can guide researchers and practitioners in creating narratives that are cognitively effective and resonant with their audiences.

4. **Standardization Across Disciplines**  
   - A key aspect of the *General Model of Narratology* is its claim to standardization. *Reader Interaction* is crucial for maintaining this standardization because it ensures that the model can adapt to the interpretative practices of different fields without losing its core structure. As **Wayne C. Booth** and **Wolfgang Iser** demonstrate, narratives engage readers at multiple levels—emotionally, ethically, and cognitively—and these engagements can vary widely depending on the context of the field. By integrating *Reader Interaction*, the *General Model* allows narratives to be interpreted through a consistent lens, while still accommodating the varying interpretative practices in different fields.

5. **Application to Technology and Digital Media**  
   - In emerging fields such as digital media, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence, *Reader Interaction* is even more relevant. As **Marie-Laure Ryan** emphasized, modern narratives often involve interactive elements where readers (or users) make choices that shape the story's outcome. The *General Model of Narratology* needs to account for these user-driven narratives, where the reader's role goes beyond interpretation and becomes one of co-creation. Without *Reader Interaction* as a core component, the model would be unable to fully address the complexities of modern digital storytelling, where narratives are not static but evolve based on user input.

### Conclusion
**Reader Interaction** is a necessary component of the *General Model of Narratology* because it ensures that the framework remains adaptable, flexible, and applicable across diverse fields of study. By emphasizing the active role of the reader, the model recognizes that narratives are not static objects but dynamic experiences shaped by interpretation, context, and cognitive engagement. Whether in traditional fields like literature and history or modern disciplines such as technology and media, *Reader Interaction* allows the *General Model* to account for the fluidity of narrative meaning and provide a comprehensive and standardized approach for narrative analysis.

# Title:  
**A Comprehensive Methodological Framework for an Integrated Narratology Model**

# Abstract
This paper proposes a comprehensive methodological framework for an integrated model of narratology. This model synthesizes key theoretical contributions from established scholars, enhancing the study of narrative structures, functions, and their broader implications. The research outlines the process of combining traditional and contemporary narrative theories to form a nuanced, multifaceted framework. Through a detailed analysis of narrative structure, voice, reader interaction, genre specificity, and cultural contexts, this paper aims to establish a robust and adaptable narratological model. The methodology employed is rigorously grounded in comparative analysis, systematic categorization, and cognitive integration, making it a significant contribution to the field of narratology.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Rationale
Narratology, the study of narrative structures and functions, has undergone significant evolution since its formalization in the 20th century. With contributions from structuralism, semiotics, cognitive science, and cultural studies, narratology has expanded its scope, offering deep insights into how narratives operate across different media and cultural contexts. However, the diversity of approaches has also led to fragmentation, where individual theories often lack integration into a cohesive model. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an integrated framework that synthesizes key contributions from seminal narratologists.

## 1.2 Research Objective
The objective of this paper is to develop a nuanced narratological model that incorporates a wide range of theoretical insights, structured into a coherent framework. The model aims to enhance the analytical capacity of narratologists by providing a systematic approach that accommodates both classical and contemporary theories.

## 1.3 Research Questions
- How can existing narratological theories be synthesized into a cohesive and comprehensive model?
- What methodological approaches are most effective in integrating diverse narrative theories?
- How does this new model enhance the analysis of narrative structures and functions across different media and cultural contexts?

# 2. Literature Review

## 2.1 Structuralist Foundations
The foundational work of structuralists such as Vladimir Propp, Gérard Genette, and Seymour Chatman laid the groundwork for narratology by systematically categorizing narrative elements and structures. Propp’s morphology of folktales, Genette’s narrative discourse, and Chatman’s distinction between story and discourse provided essential tools for narrative analysis.

## 2.2 Post-Structuralist and Cognitive Approaches
Post-structuralist and cognitive narratology, represented by scholars like Mikhail Bakhtin, David Herman, and Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, expanded the field by introducing concepts of dialogism, cognitive schemas, and reader response. These approaches highlighted the dynamic and interpretative nature of narratives, emphasizing the role of the reader and cultural context in narrative construction.

## 2.3 Interdisciplinary and Media-Specific Narratology
Recent advancements in narratology have focused on the interdisciplinary and media-specific analysis of narratives. Scholars like Marie-Laure Ryan and H. Porter Abbott have explored how narratives function across different media, including digital and virtual environments, further expanding the applicability of narratological analysis.

# 3. Methodology

## 3.1 Comparative Analysis
The primary methodological approach employed in this research is comparative analysis. This involves a systematic comparison of key narratological theories to identify commonalities, differences, and potential areas for integration. The comparative analysis is conducted across several dimensions, including narrative structure, narrative voice, reader interaction, genre specificity, and cultural contexts.

### 3.1.1 Categorization and Taxonomy
The process begins with the categorization of narrative theories into thematic groups. Each group represents a specific aspect of narrative analysis, such as temporal structures, narrative functions, or reader interaction. Within each category, theories are analyzed for their unique contributions and how they can be synthesized into a broader framework.

### 3.1.2 Identification of Core Elements
Following the categorization, core elements common across multiple theories are identified. For example, the distinction between story and discourse is a recurring theme in narratology and serves as a foundational element in the new model. Similarly, the concepts of plot, narrative time, and characterization are recognized as essential components.

## 3.2 Synthesis and Integration
The synthesis process involves integrating the identified core elements into a coherent model. This is achieved through a process of conceptual blending, where theories are merged based on their complementary strengths. The integration is guided by the principle of cognitive coherence, ensuring that the final model is logically consistent and applicable across different narrative forms.

### 3.2.1 Conceptual Blending
Conceptual blending is a methodological technique borrowed from cognitive linguistics. It involves combining different conceptual spaces (in this case, narratological theories) to create a new, integrated framework. The blending process ensures that the new model retains the strengths of individual theories while addressing their limitations through complementary insights.

### 3.2.2 Cognitive Coherence
To ensure the final model's applicability and robustness, the synthesis process emphasizes cognitive coherence. This principle ensures that the integrated model is logically structured, with clearly defined relationships between different narrative elements. Cognitive coherence also enhances the model's usability in narrative analysis by providing a systematic approach to narrative structures and functions.

## 3.3 Validation and Testing
The validity of the new narratological model is tested through application to a range of narrative texts across different media. This involves a series of case studies where the model is applied to analyze narrative structures, functions, and reader interactions. The effectiveness of the model is evaluated based on its ability to provide new insights and its adaptability to different narrative contexts.

### 3.3.1 Case Study Selection
Case studies are selected based on their diversity in narrative form, medium, and cultural context. This selection includes classical literature, contemporary fiction, digital narratives, and film, ensuring that the model's applicability is thoroughly tested across a broad spectrum.

### 3.3.2 Analytical Procedure
Each case study is analyzed using the integrated narratological model, focusing on specific aspects such as narrative time, characterization, and reader response. The analysis is documented in detail, with particular attention to how the model enhances understanding of the narrative's structure and function.

### 3.3.3 Evaluation Criteria
The model's effectiveness is evaluated based on several criteria, including its explanatory power, adaptability, and ability to reveal new insights. Feedback from peer reviewers and narrative scholars is also incorporated to refine and improve the model.
