### Title: **Herman's Cognitive Narratology Framework**
- **Cognitive Narratology**:
  - **Definition**: David Herman is a leading figure in the field of cognitive narratology, which examines how narratives are processed, understood, and produced by the human mind. Cognitive narratology explores the intersection of narrative theory and cognitive science, focusing on how narrative structures align with cognitive processes.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrative as a Cognitive Tool**:
      - **Definition**: In *"Story Logic,"* Herman argues that narrative is a fundamental cognitive tool that humans use to make sense of the world. Narratives help individuals organize experiences, construct identities, and navigate social realities.
      - **Contextualization**: By framing narrative as a cognitive tool, Herman emphasizes its role in human cognition, showing how stories mirror mental processes like memory, perception, and imagination. This framework provides insights into the psychological underpinnings of storytelling and narrative comprehension.

### Title: **Herman's Story Logic Framework**
- **Story Logic**:
  - **Definition**: The concept of *story logic* refers to the underlying principles that govern the organization and coherence of narratives. Herman examines how stories are structured to create logical connections between events, characters, and settings, facilitating the narrative's intelligibility and impact.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrative Coherence**:
      - **Definition**: Story logic involves understanding how different elements of a narrative fit together to form a coherent whole. This includes recognizing causal relationships, thematic connections, and the narrative's overall structure.
      - **Contextualization**: Herman argues that understanding a narrative's logic requires both an analysis of its formal elements and an awareness of the cognitive strategies that readers or viewers use to interpret these elements. This approach bridges traditional narrative theory with cognitive insights, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how stories work.

### Title: **Herman's Narrative as a Cognitive Artifact Framework**
- **Narrative as a Cognitive Artifact**:
  - **Definition**: Herman introduces the idea of narratives as *cognitive artifacts,* meaning that they are products of human cognition designed to organize and communicate experiences. Narratives are tools that help individuals process complex information, solve problems, and navigate social interactions.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narratives as Tools for Thinking**:
      - **Definition**: Narratives serve as cognitive artifacts that allow people to structure their thoughts, make sense of events, and convey meaning to others.
      - **Contextualization**: By viewing narratives as cognitive artifacts, Herman underscores their utility in daily life and their role in shaping human cognition. This perspective emphasizes the functional aspects of storytelling, highlighting how narratives facilitate understanding and communication.

### Title: **Herman's Eventfulness and Tellability Framework**
- **Eventfulness and Tellability**:
  - **Definition**: In *"Story Logic,"* Herman discusses the concepts of *eventfulness* and *tellability,* which refer to the qualities that make a story worth telling and engaging to an audience. Eventfulness pertains to the significance of events within a narrative, while tellability involves the factors that make a narrative compelling.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Cultural and Contextual Influence**:
      - **Definition**: Herman explores how different cultures and contexts influence what is considered eventful or tellable, reflecting societal values and norms.
      - **Contextualization**: By analyzing eventfulness and tellability, Herman provides a framework for understanding why certain stories resonate with audiences and how cultural factors shape narrative preferences. This approach offers valuable insights into the dynamics of storytelling across different contexts.

### Title: **Herman's Temporal Logic in Narrative Framework**
- **Temporal Logic in Narrative**:
  - **Definition**: Herman explores the temporal dimensions of narrative, focusing on how stories manipulate time to create meaning. He examines techniques like anachrony (non-chronological storytelling), foreshadowing, and flashbacks, and how these affect the reader’s perception of time within the narrative.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Temporal Manipulation**:
      - **Definition**: Temporal manipulation involves altering the sequence or duration of events in a narrative to create suspense, emphasize certain aspects, or convey complex ideas.
      - **Contextualization**: Herman’s analysis of temporal logic extends to the cognitive processes involved in understanding and interpreting these temporal structures, linking narrative time with mental time. This framework enhances the understanding of how narratives play with time to engage the reader and convey deeper meanings.

### Title: **Herman's Characterization and Mind Representation Framework**
- **Characterization and Mind Representation**:
  - **Definition**: Herman delves into the representation of characters and minds in narrative, exploring how narratives construct characters’ mental states, intentions, and emotions. This area bridges narratology and cognitive science, offering insights into how narratives simulate human consciousness.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Mind Representation in Narrative**:
      - **Definition**: Herman examines how characters’ inner worlds are depicted, focusing on the narrative techniques used to convey thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
      - **Contextualization**: By understanding how narratives represent minds, Herman provides a framework for analyzing character development and reader empathy, showing how readers engage with and interpret characters’ psychological landscapes.

### Title: **Herman's Narrative Worlds Framework**
- **Narrative Worlds**:
  - **Definition**: Herman introduces the concept of *narrative worlds,* which are the imagined environments that narratives create, housing characters and events. These worlds are constructed through language and function as spaces for exploring hypothetical scenarios, ethical dilemmas, and alternative realities.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Possible Worlds Theory**:
      - **Definition**: Herman’s concept of narrative worlds is closely related to possible worlds theory, which suggests that narratives create alternate realities that exist parallel to our own.
      - **Contextualization**: By analyzing how narrative worlds are constructed and how they function within the story, Herman’s framework provides a deeper understanding of the role of imagination and creativity in narrative fiction. This approach helps to explain the immersive power of storytelling and its ability to engage readers in complex and speculative thought.
