### Title: **Booth's Narrator and Narrative Voice Framework**
- **Narrator and Narrative Voice**:
  - **Definition**: Booth’s analysis of narrative voice is another key contribution to narratology. He distinguishes between *reliable* and *unreliable narrators*, focusing on how these types of narrators affect the reader's interpretation of the story.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Reliable Narrator**:
      - **Definition**: A reliable narrator is one whose account of events is trustworthy and aligns with the values of the implied author. The reader can generally accept the narrator’s perspective as accurate and truthful.
      - **Contextualization**: Reliable narrators help create a consistent and coherent narrative, making it easier for the reader to follow the story’s moral and thematic direction.
    - **Unreliable Narrator**:
      - **Definition**: An unreliable narrator provides a biased, misleading, or distorted account of events. The reader must critically evaluate the narrative, often questioning the truthfulness of the narrator’s version of the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Booth’s work on unreliable narrators has been particularly influential, opening up new avenues for analyzing how narratives manipulate reader perception. This concept is essential for understanding the complexities of narrative voice and how it shapes the reader’s engagement with the text.
