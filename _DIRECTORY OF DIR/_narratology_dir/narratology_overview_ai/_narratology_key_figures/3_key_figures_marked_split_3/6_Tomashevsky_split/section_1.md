### Title: **Tomashevsky's Theme and Motif Framework**

- **Theme and Motif**:
  - **Definition**: Boris Tomashevsky distinguishes between *theme* and *motif* as two crucial components of narrative content that work together to convey the meaning and structure of a story.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Theme**:
      - **Definition**: The theme is the overarching idea or subject matter of the narrative. It represents the fundamental concepts, messages, or moral lessons that the narrative seeks to convey.
      - **Contextualization**: The theme provides the narrative with its core purpose, often guiding the reader's interpretation and understanding of the storyâ€™s deeper meanings.
    - **Motif**:
      - **Definition**: Motifs are recurring elements within a narrative that contribute to the development of the theme. These can include objects, phrases, situations, or actions that appear repeatedly, reinforcing the theme and providing coherence to the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: Motifs serve as building blocks that enhance the narrative's thematic depth. By recurring throughout the text, motifs help to unify the narrative and emphasize its central themes, making them more impactful and memorable for the reader.
