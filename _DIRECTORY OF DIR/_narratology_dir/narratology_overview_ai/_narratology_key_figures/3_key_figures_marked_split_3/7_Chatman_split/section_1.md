### Title: **Chatman's Story vs. Discourse Framework**

- **Story vs. Discourse**:
  - **Definition**: Seymour Chatman makes a crucial distinction between *story* and *discourse* in his analysis of narrative. This framework is fundamental for understanding how narratives function across different media, particularly in literature and film.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Story**:
      - **Definition**: The story encompasses the events, characters, settings, and actions that constitute the narrative. It represents the raw material of the narrative, existing independently of the way it is presented to the audience.
      - **Contextualization**: The story is the underlying content or "what happens" in the narrative, providing the essential building blocks that can be arranged in various ways to create different narrative effects.
    - **Discourse**:
      - **Definition**: Discourse refers to the structure and technique of how the story is told. It includes the narrative voice, focalization, style, and the medium used (e.g., text, film) to convey the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Discourse is about the "how" of storytelling. It shapes the audience's experience of the story by controlling the presentation of events, the perspective from which they are seen, and the stylistic choices that influence interpretation. Understanding the distinction between story and discourse is key to analyzing narrative strategies and their effects.
