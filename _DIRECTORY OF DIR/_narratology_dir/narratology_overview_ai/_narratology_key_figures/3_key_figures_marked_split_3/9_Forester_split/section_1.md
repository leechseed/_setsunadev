### Title: **Forster's Flat and Round Characters Model**

- **Flat and Round Characters**:
  - **Definition**: E.M. Forster introduces the concepts of *flat* and *round* characters to describe different types of character development in narratives. This distinction is central to understanding how characters function within a story and contribute to its overall impact.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Flat Characters**:
      - **Definition**: Flat characters are simple, one-dimensional characters who can be summed up in a single sentence. They do not undergo significant development or change throughout the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Flat characters often serve specific narrative functions, such as providing comic relief, embodying a particular idea, or fulfilling a role without the need for complexity. Their predictability and consistency make them useful for maintaining certain themes or messages without diverting attention from the main plot.
    - **Round Characters**:
      - **Definition**: Round characters are complex, multi-faceted, and capable of growth or change over the course of the narrative. They exhibit a range of emotions and are more relatable and realistic.
      - **Contextualization**: Forster praises round characters for their ability to surprise readers in a convincing way, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative. These characters are often central to the story, driving the plot and allowing for more intricate explorations of human nature and relationships.
