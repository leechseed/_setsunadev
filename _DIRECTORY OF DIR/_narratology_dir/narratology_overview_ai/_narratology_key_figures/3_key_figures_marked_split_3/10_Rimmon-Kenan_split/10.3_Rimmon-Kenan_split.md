### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Focalization Framework**

- **Focalization**:
  - **Definition**: Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan provides an in-depth analysis of *focalization*, a concept originally developed by Gérard Genette. Focalization refers to the perspective through which a narrative is presented, focusing on who sees or perceives the events within the story.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Focalizer**:
      - **Definition**: The focalizer is the agent whose perspective orients the narrative. This can be a character within the story or an external narrator who guides the reader’s understanding of the events.
      - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan’s analysis clarifies how focalization shapes the reader’s experience of the narrative, particularly in complex scenarios where the perspective shifts or where multiple focalizers are present. Understanding the focalizer’s role is crucial for interpreting the narrative’s bias, focus, and overall point of view.
    - **Focalized**:
      - **Definition**: The focalized refers to the object or entity being perceived by the focalizer. It is what the focalizer sees or experiences within the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: By distinguishing between the focalizer and the focalized, Rimmon-Kenan offers a nuanced approach to analyzing how narratives are structured and how different perspectives influence the story's meaning and reader interpretation.

### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Narrative Levels Framework**

- **Narrative Levels**:
  - **Definition**: Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan explores the concept of narrative levels, which refer to the different layers or planes of narration within a story. This includes the distinction between extradiegetic and intradiegetic levels, as well as the phenomenon of metalepsis.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Extradiegetic Level**:
      - **Definition**: The extradiegetic level refers to narration that occurs outside the story world. This is typically the primary level of narration, where the narrator is not a character within the narrative but exists externally to tell the story.
      - **Contextualization**: Understanding the extradiegetic level is essential for analyzing the overarching narrative voice and how it frames the story for the reader.
    - **Intradiegetic Level**:
      - **Definition**: The intradiegetic level refers to narration that occurs within the story world, often involving characters who tell stories within the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: This level adds depth to the narrative by introducing multiple layers of storytelling, each with its own perspective and potential biases.
    - **Metalepsis**:
      - **Definition**: Metalepsis occurs when the boundaries between different narrative levels are transgressed, such as when a character interacts with the narrator or steps outside their narrative world.
      - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan’s exploration of metalepsis highlights the complexity of narrative structure and the ways in which breaking narrative boundaries can create unique effects, challenging the reader’s perception of the story.

### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Characterization Framework**

- **Characterization**:
  - **Definition**: In her analysis of characterization, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan examines how characters are constructed within narrative fiction. She explores the various methods authors use to present characters, shaping the reader's understanding and engagement with them.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Direct Characterization**:
      - **Definition**: Direct characterization involves explicit description by the narrator or other characters, providing clear information about a character’s traits, appearance, or background.
      - **Contextualization**: This method offers straightforward insights into a character, but Rimmon-Kenan also encourages readers to consider how these descriptions might be influenced by the narrator's bias or perspective.
    - **Indirect Characterization**:
      - **Definition**: Indirect characterization is conveyed through a character's actions, speech, thoughts, and interactions with others, allowing the reader to infer their qualities.
      - **Contextualization**: Indirect characterization requires more active engagement from the reader, who must piece together clues to form a complete understanding of the character. Rimmon-Kenan highlights how indirect methods can create more complex and multi-dimensional characters.
    - **Narrative Voice and Focalization**:
      - **Definition**: The narrative voice and focalization also play crucial roles in shaping how characters are perceived. The perspective from which a character is presented can significantly affect the reader's interpretation of their actions and motives.
      - **Contextualization**: Analyzing the interplay between narrative voice, focalization, and characterization allows for a deeper understanding of how characters are constructed and how their roles within the narrative are interpreted by the reader.

### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Textual and Intertextual Analysis Framework**

- **Textual and Intertextual Analysis**:
  - **Definition**: Rimmon-Kenan emphasizes the importance of textual and intertextual analysis in understanding narrative fiction. She explores how narratives are constructed not only within their own boundaries but also in relation to other texts.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Textual Analysis**:
      - **Definition**: Textual analysis focuses on the internal structure and elements of a narrative, such as language, themes, and narrative techniques.
      - **Contextualization**: By closely examining the text itself, this method uncovers the intricacies of narrative construction and meaning, offering a detailed understanding of how the story functions on its own terms.
    - **Intertextual Analysis**:
      - **Definition**: Intertextual analysis examines the relationships between a narrative and other texts, including allusions, quotations, and references that contribute to the narrative's meaning.
      - **Contextualization**: Intertextuality broadens the scope of analysis by placing the narrative within a larger literary or cultural context. Rimmon-Kenan’s focus on intertextual analysis reveals how narratives engage in dialogue with other works, enriching their thematic and symbolic significance.

### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Narrative Strategies Framework**

- **Narrative Strategies**:
  - **Definition**: Rimmon-Kenan delves into various narrative strategies employed by authors to shape the reader's interpretation and understanding of the narrative. These strategies include unreliable narration, stream of consciousness, and free indirect discourse.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Unreliable Narration**:
      - **Definition**: Unreliable narration occurs when the narrator’s credibility is compromised, leading the reader to question the truthfulness or accuracy of the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: This strategy creates a complex reading experience, as the reader must navigate the narrative’s inconsistencies and decide which elements to trust, often leading to multiple interpretations of the story.
    - **Stream of Consciousness**:
      - **Definition**: Stream of consciousness is a narrative technique that attempts to capture the continuous flow of a character’s thoughts and feelings, often in a disjointed or non-linear manner.
      - **Contextualization**: This technique immerses the reader in the character’s inner world, providing a deep psychological portrait but also challenging the reader to piece together the narrative from a fragmented perspective.
    - **Free Indirect Discourse**:
      - **Definition**: Free indirect discourse blends the character’s thoughts and speech with the narrator’s voice, allowing the narrative to shift fluidly between perspectives without clear demarcation.
      - **Contextualization**: This strategy allows for a more intimate and flexible narrative voice, offering insights into characters' thoughts while maintaining the narrator’s presence. Rimmon-Kenan’s analysis of these strategies highlights their role in creating nuanced and layered narratives that engage the reader on multiple levels.
