# definitions


- **Prima-forma:** Refers to the 'first form,' representing the foundational concepts used to build the rudimentary model of the general theory of narrativity.

- **Corpus:** Means 'body' or 'body of work.' It is intended as a metaphor for a collection of systems, organs, processes, etc., within the narrative framework.

- **Artifex:** Means 'creator' or 'craftsman' in Latin. This concept suggests that characters within the narrative are seen as creators or craftsmen of the narrative itself.

- **Taberna:** Refers to a 'tavern' or 'inn.' The theory proposes that perspectives (designer, reader, narrator) congregate and coexist in a communal space where services are rendered. Each perspective has a purpose for either providing or receiving services in the tavern. Moreover, the concept of 'good faith' operates within the tavern, meaning that the intentions and goals of each perspective are clear and reasonable, though they can adapt since all perspectives are treated as participants with mutual goals.

- **Manamus:** Means 'we flow,' symbolizing the organization of time, plot, fabula, etc. The theory posits that time flows and ebbs like water from a spring. It can pool, wind backward, and so on. Water represents the idea of continuous forward momentum while also illustrating concepts such as volume, pressure, and speed.

- **Animus:** Represents 'spirit,' referring to the 'meaning' or theory that elaborates on the esoteric fabric binding the narrative architecture together.

- **Syntaxis:** Refers to the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.
