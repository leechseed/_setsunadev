### Title: **Todorov's Genres as Structures Framework**

- **Genres as Structures**:
  - **Definition**: Tzvetan Todorov extends his structural analysis to the study of literary genres, proposing that genres should be viewed not as rigid, fixed categories, but as dynamic structures that evolve over time. Todorov argues that genres are shaped by their narrative forms, which in turn influence how readers interpret texts within those genres.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Dynamic Nature of Genres**:
      - **Definition**: Todorov emphasizes that genres are not static; they evolve, adapt, and change in response to cultural, historical, and literary developments. This dynamic nature allows genres to remain relevant and to continuously offer new ways of storytelling.
      - **Contextualization**: By viewing genres as structures that evolve, Todorov challenges the traditional notion of fixed genre boundaries. This perspective allows for a more flexible understanding of how genres interact, overlap, and influence one another over time.
    - **Genre-Specific 'static' Narrative Forms**:
      - **Definition**: Different genres utilize specific narrative forms or structures that guide the reader’s expectations and interpretation. These forms include common plot structures, character types, and thematic elements that are characteristic of particular genres.
      - **Contextualization**: Understanding genre-specific narrative forms helps to decode how genres shape the reader’s experience of a text. Todorov’s framework suggests that the recognition of these forms is essential for interpreting the meaning and function of a narrative within its genre.
