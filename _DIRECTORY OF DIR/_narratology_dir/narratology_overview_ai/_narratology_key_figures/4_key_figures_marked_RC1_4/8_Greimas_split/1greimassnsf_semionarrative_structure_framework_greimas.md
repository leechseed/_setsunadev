### Title: **Greimas's Semio-Narrative Structure Framework**

- **The Semio-Narrative Structure**:
  - **Definition**: Algirdas Julien Greimas introduces the concept of the *semio-narrative structure*, which is a framework for understanding how meaning is generated in narratives. This structure posits that narratives are composed of basic units of meaning, known as semes, which are organized into larger structures. These structures are linked through various relations, allowing for the generation and transmission of meaning.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Semes**:
      - **Definition**: Semes are the smallest units of meaning within a narrative. They function as the building blocks of the narrative’s semantic content.
      - **Contextualization**: By analyzing how semes are organized and related within a narrative, Greimas’s framework allows for the uncovering of the underlying logic and thematic coherence of the story.
    - **Structural Analysis**:
      - **Definition**: The semio-narrative structure involves examining the relationships between semes to understand how they contribute to the overall meaning of the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: This approach enables a deeper analysis of narrative structures, revealing how meaning is constructed and how different elements of a narrative interact to create a cohesive whole.
