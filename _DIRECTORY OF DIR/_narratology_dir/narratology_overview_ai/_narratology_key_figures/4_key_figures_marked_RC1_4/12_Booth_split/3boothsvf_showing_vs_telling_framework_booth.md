### Title: **Booth's Showing vs. Telling Framework**
- **Showing vs. Telling**:
  - **Definition**: Booth explores the dichotomy between *showing* and *telling* in narrative fiction, two fundamental techniques used in storytelling.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Showing**:
      - **Definition**: Showing involves presenting events and dialogue directly, allowing readers to interpret them without explicit commentary from the narrator or author.
      - **Contextualization**: This technique engages readers by letting them draw their own conclusions from the actions and words of the characters, often leading to a more immersive experience.
    - **Telling**:
      - **Definition**: Telling refers to when the author or narrator provides direct commentary, interpretation, or explanation of events. It offers readers a guided understanding of the narrative’s meaning and implications.
      - **Contextualization**: Booth argues that both showing and telling are rhetorical choices that serve different narrative purposes. The effectiveness of a narrative often depends on how these techniques are balanced, with each contributing to the story’s overall impact in different ways.
