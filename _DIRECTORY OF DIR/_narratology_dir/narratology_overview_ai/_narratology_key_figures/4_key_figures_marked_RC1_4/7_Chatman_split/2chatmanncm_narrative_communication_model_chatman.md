### Title: **Chatman's Narrative Communication Model**

- **Narrative Communication**:
  - **Definition**: Seymour Chatman introduces a model of narrative communication that highlights the complex relationships between various agents involved in the creation and reception of a narrative. This model includes the *real author*, *implied author*, *narrator*, *narratee*, *implied reader*, and *real reader*.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Real Author and Implied Author**:
      - **Definition**: The real author is the actual creator of the narrative, while the implied author is the version of the author constructed by the text, embodying the values, style, and intentions inferred by the reader.
      - **Contextualization**: The concept of the implied author allows for a separation between the author's personal identity and the narrative persona created within the text, providing a framework for understanding how narratives guide interpretation.
    - **Narrator and Narratee**:
      - **Definition**: The narrator is the voice that tells the story, while the narratee is the imagined audience within the text to whom the narrator speaks.
      - **Contextualization**: This relationship shapes the narrative's tone, style, and the information that is revealed to the reader, making it crucial for analyzing the dynamics of storytelling.
    - **Implied Reader and Real Reader**:
      - **Definition**: The implied reader is the idealized audience that the narrative seems to address, while the real reader is the actual person engaging with the text.
      - **Contextualization**: The distinction between implied and real readers helps to explore how narratives are crafted to evoke specific responses and how actual readers may interpret texts differently based on their unique perspectives.
