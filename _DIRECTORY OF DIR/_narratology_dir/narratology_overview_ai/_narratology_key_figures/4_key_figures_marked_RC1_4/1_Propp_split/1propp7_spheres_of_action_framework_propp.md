### Title: **Propp's Spheres of Action Framework**
Vladimir Propp categorized characters in folktales into seven broad types based on their roles and functions within the narrative. These roles, or "Spheres of Action," are essential to understanding the structure of the tale and the relationship between characters.

1. **The Villain**:
   - **Role**: The antagonist who opposes the hero and creates obstacles or challenges.
   - **Function**: The villain's actions drive the conflict of the story. They may cause harm, deceive, or challenge the hero, creating the central problem that the hero must overcome.

2. **The Donor**:
   - **Role**: The character who prepares the hero or provides them with a magical object or assistance.
   - **Function**: The donor tests the hero's worthiness, often through a challenge or task. If the hero passes the test, the donor rewards them with a magical item, advice, or knowledge that is crucial for the hero's success.

3. **The Helper**:
   - **Role**: The character who aids the hero in their quest.
   - **Function**: The helper provides support to the hero, often in critical moments. This assistance can come in the form of physical help, guidance, or the use of a magical object provided by the donor.

4. **The Princess (and her father)**:
   - **Role**: The sought-after person (often female) who acts as the hero's reward and/or the hero's goal.
   - **Function**: The princess is usually the object of the hero's quest, often requiring rescue from the villain. Her father, if present, often sets tasks for the hero or offers the hero a reward. The princess's hand in marriage or the father's blessing often serves as the ultimate prize for the hero's success.

5. **The Dispatcher**:
   - **Role**: The character who sends the hero on their quest.
   - **Function**: The dispatcher recognizes a lack or a problem and sends the hero on the mission to resolve it. This character initiates the hero's journey, setting the story in motion.

6. **The Hero**:
   - **Role**: The protagonist who seeks something valuable and strives to restore equilibrium.
   - **Function**: The hero is the central character around whom the story revolves. The hero takes on challenges, battles the villain, and undergoes a transformation. In the end, the hero often gains something of value, whether it be a reward, wisdom, or a new status.

7. **The False Hero**:
   - **Role**: A character who initially seems to be a hero but ultimately proves to be unworthy or deceptive.
   - **Function**: The false hero often tries to take credit for the hero's actions or seeks to usurp the hero's position. This character's duplicity is usually revealed toward the end of the story, leading to their exposure and punishment.
