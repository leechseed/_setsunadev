### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Focalization Framework**

- **Focalization**:
  - **Definition**: Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan provides an in-depth analysis of *focalization*, a concept originally developed by Gérard Genette. Focalization refers to the perspective through which a narrative is presented, focusing on who sees or perceives the events within the story.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Focalizer**:
      - **Definition**: The focalizer is the agent whose perspective orients the narrative. This can be a character within the story or an external narrator who guides the reader’s understanding of the events.
      - **Contextualization**: Rimmon-Kenan’s analysis clarifies how focalization shapes the reader’s experience of the narrative, particularly in complex scenarios where the perspective shifts or where multiple focalizers are present. Understanding the focalizer’s role is crucial for interpreting the narrative’s bias, focus, and overall point of view.
    - **Focalized**:
      - **Definition**: The focalized refers to the object or entity being perceived by the focalizer. It is what the focalizer sees or experiences within the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: By distinguishing between the focalizer and the focalized, Rimmon-Kenan offers a nuanced approach to analyzing how narratives are structured and how different perspectives influence the story's meaning and reader interpretation.
