### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Textual and Intertextual Analysis Framework**

- **Textual and Intertextual Analysis**:
  - **Definition**: Rimmon-Kenan emphasizes the importance of textual and intertextual analysis in understanding narrative fiction. She explores how narratives are constructed not only within their own boundaries but also in relation to other texts.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Textual Analysis**:
      - **Definition**: Textual analysis focuses on the internal structure and elements of a narrative, such as language, themes, and narrative techniques.
      - **Contextualization**: By closely examining the text itself, this method uncovers the intricacies of narrative construction and meaning, offering a detailed understanding of how the story functions on its own terms.
    - **Intertextual Analysis**:
      - **Definition**: Intertextual analysis examines the relationships between a narrative and other texts, including allusions, quotations, and references that contribute to the narrative's meaning.
      - **Contextualization**: Intertextuality broadens the scope of analysis by placing the narrative within a larger literary or cultural context. Rimmon-Kenanâ€™s focus on intertextual analysis reveals how narratives engage in dialogue with other works, enriching their thematic and symbolic significance.
