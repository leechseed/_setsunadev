### Title: **Rimmon-Kenan's Narrative Discourse Strategies Framework**

- **Narrative Discourse Strategies**:
  - **Definition**: Rimmon-Kenan delves into various narrative strategies employed by authors to shape the reader's interpretation and understanding of the narrative. These strategies include unreliable narration, stream of consciousness, and free indirect discourse.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Unreliable Narration**:
      - **Definition**: Unreliable narration occurs when the narrator’s credibility is compromised, leading the reader to question the truthfulness or accuracy of the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: This strategy creates a complex reading experience, as the reader must navigate the narrative’s inconsistencies and decide which elements to trust, often leading to multiple interpretations of the story.
    - **Stream of Consciousness**:
      - **Definition**: Stream of consciousness is a narrative technique that attempts to capture the continuous flow of a character’s thoughts and feelings, often in a disjointed or non-linear manner.
      - **Contextualization**: This technique immerses the reader in the character’s inner world, providing a deep psychological portrait but also challenging the reader to piece together the narrative from a fragmented perspective.
    - **Free Indirect Discourse**:
      - **Definition**: Free indirect discourse blends the character’s thoughts and speech with the narrator’s voice, allowing the narrative to shift fluidly between perspectives without clear demarcation.
      - **Contextualization**: This strategy allows for a more intimate and flexible narrative voice, offering insights into characters' thoughts while maintaining the narrator’s presence. Rimmon-Kenan’s analysis of these strategies highlights their role in creating nuanced and layered narratives that engage the reader on multiple levels.
