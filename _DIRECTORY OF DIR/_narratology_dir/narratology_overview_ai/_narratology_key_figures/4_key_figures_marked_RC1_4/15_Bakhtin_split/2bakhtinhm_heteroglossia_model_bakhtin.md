### Title: **Bakhtin's Heteroglossia Model**
- **Heteroglossia**:
  - **Definition**: Heteroglossia, closely related to dialogism, is defined by Bakhtin as the coexistence of multiple forms of speech or social languages within a single text. It reflects the diversity of voices and perspectives in society, which are brought into dialogue within the narrative.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Plurality of Voices**:
      - **Definition**: Heteroglossia challenges the idea of a monologic or singular narrative voice, emphasizing instead the plurality and conflict of voices within any given text.
      - **Contextualization**: This concept underscores the complexity of narrative, where multiple social, cultural, and ideological perspectives are woven together, creating a rich and layered text that resists simple interpretation.
