### Title: **Bakhtin's Novel as a Dynamic Genre Model**
- **The Novel as a Dynamic Genre**:
  - **Definition**: In *"Epic and Novel,"* Bakhtin contrasts the novel with the epic, arguing that the novel is a uniquely modern and dynamic genre characterized by its openness to change, diversity of voices, and capacity to engage with contemporary life.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Flexibility and Openness**:
      - **Definition**: Unlike the epic, which is tied to a fixed and idealized past, the novel is a genre that evolves over time and reflects the complexities and contradictions of the present.
      - **Contextualization**: This view of the novel as a flexible and dialogic form has influenced subsequent theories of narrative and genre, positioning the novel as a central vehicle for exploring modernity and social change.
