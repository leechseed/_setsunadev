### Title: **Sternberg's Suspense, Curiosity, and Surprise Model**
- **Suspense, Curiosity, and Surprise**:
  - **Definition**: Sternberg’s work focuses on the emotional and cognitive effects that narrative structures can evoke in the reader. He identifies three key responses—suspense, curiosity, and surprise—that are central to the reader’s engagement with the narrative.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Suspense**:
      - **Definition**: Suspense is a state of anticipation about the outcome of an event that is yet to occur, often created by delayed or suspended exposition.
      - **Contextualization**: Suspense keeps the reader invested in the narrative, generating tension as they wait to see how events will unfold. It is a driving force that sustains the reader’s attention and emotional involvement in the story.
    - **Curiosity**:
      - **Definition**: Curiosity is the desire to know the causes or background of an event that has already been presented, often evoked by anachronic narratives that reveal effects before causes.
      - **Contextualization**: Curiosity motivates the reader to seek out missing information, encouraging deeper engagement with the narrative as they piece together the story’s chronology and underlying connections.
    - **Surprise**:
      - **Definition**: Surprise is a reaction to an unexpected event or revelation, often resulting from the strategic withholding of information or misleading exposition.
      - **Contextualization**: Surprise can reframe the reader’s understanding of the narrative, prompting them to reconsider previous assumptions and enhancing the overall impact of the story through unexpected twists and revelations.
