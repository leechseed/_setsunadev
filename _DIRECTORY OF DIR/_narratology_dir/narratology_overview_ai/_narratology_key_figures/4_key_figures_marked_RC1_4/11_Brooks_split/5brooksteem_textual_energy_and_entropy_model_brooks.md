### Title: **Brooks's Textual Energy and Entropy Model**
- **Textual Energy and Entropy**:
  - **Definition**: Drawing on psychoanalytic and thermodynamic metaphors, Peter Brooks introduces the concepts of *textual energy* and *entropy* to describe the dynamics within a narrative. Textual energy refers to the drive toward narrative closure, while entropy represents the dispersal or dissipation of that energy.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Textual Energy**:
      - **Definition**: Textual energy is the force that propels the narrative forward, akin to the psychological drive for resolution or closure within the story.
      - **Contextualization**: This energy sustains the readerâ€™s interest and engagement, as the narrative builds toward its climax and eventual resolution.
    - **Entropy**:
      - **Definition**: Entropy in narrative terms refers to the natural dissipation of this energy as the narrative progresses, leading to a gradual release of tension and the eventual resolution of the plot.
      - **Contextualization**: Understanding the balance between textual energy and entropy helps to explain how narratives maintain momentum and achieve a satisfying conclusion, ensuring that the story resonates with readers.
