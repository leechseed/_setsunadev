### Title: **Brooks's Role of Desire in Narrative Framework**

- **The Role of Desire in Narrative**:
  - **Definition**: A central theme in Peter Brooks’ work is the role of desire in driving narrative structure. Brooks draws on Freud’s theories, particularly the death drive (Thanatos) and the pleasure principle (Eros), to explain how narratives are propelled by a deep-seated desire for closure.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Desire for Closure**:
      - **Definition**: The desire for closure is the narrative’s drive to reach a resolution, which creates tension and anticipation as the plot unfolds. This desire mirrors Freud’s idea of the human psyche’s longing for a return to a state of equilibrium or rest.
      - **Contextualization**: Brooks suggests that this narrative desire manifests in the reader’s experience as a compelling need to see the story through to its conclusion, thus engaging the reader emotionally and intellectually. This framework helps to explain the narrative’s pacing and how it sustains reader interest through its progression toward resolution.
