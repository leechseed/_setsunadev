### Title: **Tomashevsky's Narrative Devices Framework**

- **Narrative Devices**:
  - **Definition**: In addition to his work on thematics, Tomashevsky studied various narrative devices, such as the use of irony, allegory, and symbolism in literature. His analysis of these devices contributed to a broader understanding of how narrative techniques shape the reader’s experience.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Irony, Allegory, Symbolism**:
      - **Definition**: These narrative devices are tools that authors use to add layers of meaning, complexity, and depth to their narratives. Irony creates contrasts between expectations and reality, allegory conveys deeper moral or political meanings, and symbolism imbues objects or actions with broader significance.
      - **Contextualization**: Tomashevsky’s analysis of narrative devices provides insight into how these techniques can enhance the reader’s engagement with the text, making the narrative more resonant and multi-dimensional. His work helps to explain how these devices contribute to the richness and interpretive possibilities of literary works.
