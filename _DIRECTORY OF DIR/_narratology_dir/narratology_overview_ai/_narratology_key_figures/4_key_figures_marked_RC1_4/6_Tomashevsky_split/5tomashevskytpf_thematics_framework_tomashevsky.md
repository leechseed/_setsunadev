### Title: **Tomashevsky's Thematics and Poetics Framework**

- **Thematics and Poetics**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky integrates his analysis of thematics into the broader study of poetics, which is the formal analysis of literary texts. He views thematics as a critical component of poetics, essential for understanding how narratives function as artistic constructs.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Integration of Theme and Structure**:
      - **Definition**: The interaction between theme, motif, and narrative structure is crucial for understanding the overall impact of a literary work. Tomashevsky argues that these elements cannot be studied in isolation but must be considered together to fully grasp the narrative’s artistic value.
      - **Contextualization**: By focusing on the integration of thematic content with narrative structure, Tomashevsky’s framework provides a comprehensive approach to literary analysis. It allows scholars to see how the narrative’s form and content work together to create a cohesive and impactful literary work.
