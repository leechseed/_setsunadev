### Title: **Tomashevsky's Defamiliarization Model**

- **Defamiliarization (Ostranenie)**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky contributed to the concept of defamiliarization, originally introduced by Viktor Shklovsky. Defamiliarization refers to the technique of presenting common objects or events in an unfamiliar way to make the reader perceive them differently.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrative and Thematic Defamiliarization**:
      - **Definition**: Tomashevsky explored how narrative structure and thematic elements could be used to achieve defamiliarization in literature. By altering familiar narrative conventions or thematic expectations, the narrative can challenge the reader’s perceptions and provoke deeper thought.
      - **Contextualization**: Defamiliarization is a powerful tool for renewing the reader’s awareness of the ordinary, making the familiar strange and encouraging a fresh perspective. Tomashevsky’s work in this area underscores the importance of innovative narrative techniques in revitalizing literature and engaging the reader.
