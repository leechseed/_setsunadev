### Title: **Tomashevsky's Reader Interaction Model**

- **The Role of the Reader**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky explores how the arrangement of themes and motifs influences the reader’s interpretation of the narrative. He argues that the *sjuzhet* is constructed to guide the reader’s attention and create specific effects, such as suspense, surprise, or emotional engagement.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Guided Interpretation**:
      - **Definition**: The sjuzhet is designed to direct the reader’s focus, leading them through the narrative in a way that maximizes its impact. This involves the strategic use of narrative devices to evoke desired responses from the reader.
      - **Contextualization**: Tomashevsky’s model emphasizes the active role of the reader in piecing together the narrative from the clues provided by the sjuzhet. The reader is not a passive recipient but an active participant in the construction of meaning, influenced by how the narrative is presented.
