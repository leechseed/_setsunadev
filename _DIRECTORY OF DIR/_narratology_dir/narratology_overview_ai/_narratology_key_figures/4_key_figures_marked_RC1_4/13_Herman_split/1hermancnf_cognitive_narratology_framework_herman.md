### Title: **Herman's Cognitive Narratology Framework**
- **Cognitive Narratology**:
  - **Definition**: David Herman is a leading figure in the field of cognitive narratology, which examines how narratives are processed, understood, and produced by the human mind. Cognitive narratology explores the intersection of narrative theory and cognitive science, focusing on how narrative structures align with cognitive processes.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrative as a Cognitive Tool**:
      - **Definition**: In *"Story Logic,"* Herman argues that narrative is a fundamental cognitive tool that humans use to make sense of the world. Narratives help individuals organize experiences, construct identities, and navigate social realities.
      - **Contextualization**: By framing narrative as a cognitive tool, Herman emphasizes its role in human cognition, showing how stories mirror mental processes like memory, perception, and imagination. This framework provides insights into the psychological underpinnings of storytelling and narrative comprehension.
