### Title: **Herman's Narrative Worlds Framework**
- **Narrative Worlds**:
  - **Definition**: Herman introduces the concept of *narrative worlds,* which are the imagined environments that narratives create, housing characters and events. These worlds are constructed through language and function as spaces for exploring hypothetical scenarios, ethical dilemmas, and alternative realities.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Possible Worlds Theory**:
      - **Definition**: Herman’s concept of narrative worlds is closely related to possible worlds theory, which suggests that narratives create alternate realities that exist parallel to our own.
      - **Contextualization**: By analyzing how narrative worlds are constructed and how they function within the story, Herman’s framework provides a deeper understanding of the role of imagination and creativity in narrative fiction. This approach helps to explain the immersive power of storytelling and its ability to engage readers in complex and speculative thought.
