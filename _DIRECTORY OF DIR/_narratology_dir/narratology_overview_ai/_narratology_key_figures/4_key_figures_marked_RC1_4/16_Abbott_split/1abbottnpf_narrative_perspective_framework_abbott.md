### Title: **Abbott's Narrative Perspective Framework**
- **Narrative Perspective**:
  - **Definition**: H. Porter Abbott provides a thorough exploration of narrative perspective, focusing on the distinction between *who sees* (focalization) and *who speaks* (narrative voice). These two aspects are crucial for understanding how stories are told and how they shape the reader’s engagement with the narrative.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Focalization (Who Sees)**:
      - **Definition**: Focalization refers to the perspective through which the events of the narrative are perceived. It involves identifying the character or entity whose point of view shapes the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: By analyzing focalization, Abbott explores how different viewpoints can influence the reader's understanding of the story, highlighting the importance of perspective in shaping narrative meaning.
    - **Narrative Voice (Who Speaks)**:
      - **Definition**: Narrative voice refers to the entity or persona that narrates the story. It encompasses first-person, third-person, and omniscient narration, each offering different levels of insight and control over the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: Abbott’s analysis of narrative voice includes a deep dive into unreliable narrators, explaining how selective presentation of information can manipulate reader perception, creating layers of meaning and complexity within the story.
