# Boris Tomashevsky's Contributions to Narratology


---

### Title: **Tomashevsky's Theme and Motif Framework**

- **Theme and Motif**:
  - **Definition**: Boris Tomashevsky distinguishes between *theme* and *motif* as two crucial components of narrative content that work together to convey the meaning and structure of a story.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Theme**:
      - **Definition**: The theme is the overarching idea or subject matter of the narrative. It represents the fundamental concepts, messages, or moral lessons that the narrative seeks to convey.
      - **Contextualization**: The theme provides the narrative with its core purpose, often guiding the reader's interpretation and understanding of the story’s deeper meanings.
    - **Motif**:
      - **Definition**: Motifs are recurring elements within a narrative that contribute to the development of the theme. These can include objects, phrases, situations, or actions that appear repeatedly, reinforcing the theme and providing coherence to the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: Motifs serve as building blocks that enhance the narrative's thematic depth. By recurring throughout the text, motifs help to unify the narrative and emphasize its central themes, making them more impactful and memorable for the reader.

### Title: **Tomashevsky's Plot vs. Story Framework**

- **Plot vs. Story**:
  - **Definition**: Building on the work of Vladimir Propp and other Formalists, Boris Tomashevsky makes a clear distinction between *fabula* (story) and *sjuzhet* (plot), each serving different functions in the narrative.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Fabula**:
      - **Definition**: *Fabula* refers to the chronological sequence of events as they occur in the world of the narrative. It is the raw material of the story, representing what happens in a linear timeline.
      - **Contextualization**: The fabula provides the foundational events of the narrative, offering a straightforward account of what transpires within the story world, independent of how these events are presented.
    - **Sjuzhet**:
      - **Definition**: *Sjuzhet* is the way these events are arranged and presented in the narrative. It is the artistic construction of the story, designed to create specific effects and manipulate the reader’s perception of the narrative.
      - **Contextualization**: The sjuzhet is crucial for the narrative’s impact, as it controls the pacing, reveals information selectively, and guides the reader’s emotional and intellectual response. Tomashevsky emphasizes that the sjuzhet is not just a reflection of the fabula but a deliberate construction that shapes the narrative experience.

### Title: **Tomashevsky's Narrative Functions Framework**

- **Narrative Functions**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky’s analysis of narrative functions focuses on the role that different elements of the narrative play in advancing the plot and developing the theme. He categorizes these functions into two types: *bound motifs* and *free motifs*.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Bound Motifs**:
      - **Definition**: Bound motifs are essential to the progression of the narrative. They are necessary for the development of the plot and cannot be removed without altering the narrative’s core structure.
      - **Contextualization**: Bound motifs drive the story forward, ensuring that the narrative maintains its logical sequence and coherence. They are the key events or actions that shape the narrative’s trajectory.
    - **Free Motifs**:
      - **Definition**: Free motifs are not essential to the plot but contribute to the atmosphere, characterization, or thematic depth of the narrative. They enrich the story by adding layers of meaning and emotional resonance.
      - **Contextualization**: Free motifs enhance the narrative’s aesthetic and thematic qualities, providing additional context or emotional impact without altering the main plotline. They offer depth and texture to the story, making it more engaging and multifaceted.

### Title: **Tomashevsky's Reader Interaction Model**

- **The Role of the Reader**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky explores how the arrangement of themes and motifs influences the reader’s interpretation of the narrative. He argues that the *sjuzhet* is constructed to guide the reader’s attention and create specific effects, such as suspense, surprise, or emotional engagement.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Guided Interpretation**:
      - **Definition**: The sjuzhet is designed to direct the reader’s focus, leading them through the narrative in a way that maximizes its impact. This involves the strategic use of narrative devices to evoke desired responses from the reader.
      - **Contextualization**: Tomashevsky’s model emphasizes the active role of the reader in piecing together the narrative from the clues provided by the sjuzhet. The reader is not a passive recipient but an active participant in the construction of meaning, influenced by how the narrative is presented.

### Title: **Tomashevsky's Thematics and Poetics Framework**

- **Thematics and Poetics**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky integrates his analysis of thematics into the broader study of poetics, which is the formal analysis of literary texts. He views thematics as a critical component of poetics, essential for understanding how narratives function as artistic constructs.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Integration of Theme and Structure**:
      - **Definition**: The interaction between theme, motif, and narrative structure is crucial for understanding the overall impact of a literary work. Tomashevsky argues that these elements cannot be studied in isolation but must be considered together to fully grasp the narrative’s artistic value.
      - **Contextualization**: By focusing on the integration of thematic content with narrative structure, Tomashevsky’s framework provides a comprehensive approach to literary analysis. It allows scholars to see how the narrative’s form and content work together to create a cohesive and impactful literary work.

### Title: **Tomashevsky's Defamiliarization Model**

- **Defamiliarization (Ostranenie)**:
  - **Definition**: Tomashevsky contributed to the concept of defamiliarization, originally introduced by Viktor Shklovsky. Defamiliarization refers to the technique of presenting common objects or events in an unfamiliar way to make the reader perceive them differently.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Narrative and Thematic Defamiliarization**:
      - **Definition**: Tomashevsky explored how narrative structure and thematic elements could be used to achieve defamiliarization in literature. By altering familiar narrative conventions or thematic expectations, the narrative can challenge the reader’s perceptions and provoke deeper thought.
      - **Contextualization**: Defamiliarization is a powerful tool for renewing the reader’s awareness of the ordinary, making the familiar strange and encouraging a fresh perspective. Tomashevsky’s work in this area underscores the importance of innovative narrative techniques in revitalizing literature and engaging the reader.

### Title: **Tomashevsky's Narrative Devices Framework**

- **Narrative Devices**:
  - **Definition**: In addition to his work on thematics, Tomashevsky studied various narrative devices, such as the use of irony, allegory, and symbolism in literature. His analysis of these devices contributed to a broader understanding of how narrative techniques shape the reader’s experience.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - **Irony, Allegory, Symbolism**:
      - **Definition**: These narrative devices are tools that authors use to add layers of meaning, complexity, and depth to their narratives. Irony creates contrasts between expectations and reality, allegory conveys deeper moral or political meanings, and symbolism imbues objects or actions with broader significance.
      - **Contextualization**: Tomashevsky’s analysis of narrative devices provides insight into how these techniques can enhance the reader’s engagement with the text, making the narrative more resonant and multi-dimensional. His work helps to explain how these devices contribute to the richness and interpretive possibilities of literary works.
