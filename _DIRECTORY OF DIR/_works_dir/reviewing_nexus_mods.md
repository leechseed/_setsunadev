The issue is that Nexus pretty much has a **monopoly** on the mod distribution market. It's basically the damn **Steam of modding.** So, they swing their dick around, slapping everyone in the face, and no one cares. I mean, I remember when the Hogwarts Legacy bullshit went down a couple of years ago. **Sue me** if I want my character to not look like some cannon-accurate Haggmaxxin bri’ish homunculus.

Dude, I had to slink my ass all the way down to the **seventh level of Google’s front page,** only to fat-kid-shit-cannon myself Wonka-style—**ass first**—into the septic meconium fields of Reddit.com. Jesus Christ, every time I see the "/r/" I’m reminded of what a shit-lord I was growing up. My friends and I? We’d spam this **god-tier emote** whenever there was silence between poo-poo and pee-pee jokes or when someone did something remotely stimulating. You know the one: **that limp-wristed, cross-body chest thump, glazed-eyed 'DDEEEUHHOAHUHH WEHTAWHDED.'**

Every damn time I see the characters "/r/" or "Reddit" strung together, I’m instantly transported back to those limp-wristed, de-la-stimmin days of undergrad. Back when there wasn’t just Nexus Mods, man—there was **FPSbanana, another site,** and god knows what else. I forget how I even modded the hell out of **CS:Source,** but I remember one of the **worst days of my life** was when **giant purple and black checkered polygons** hacked my PUG game. Absolute incel-bergin-baklah-sooka level tragedy. I ended up having to delete all my lame-ass gun skins. WE-RE-WE-RE=WE-Thaw-dED!

Anyways, back to the **pile of baby shit** I was battle-crawling through, which was probably /r/Askaban… hours of slogging. Every fucking post, comment, or thread about **character appearance mods—clothing, skin texture, makeup, hair—anything—was hard /r/e-chopped**: _[This post has been le locked.]_ But dude, I wasn’t gonna give up. Fuck those **slack-jawed, doot-le-doge, stank-breath, skid-mark, nippy-stimmy gang /r/-words.** I’d been edging for **two hours** at that point, and my coom brain was stuck in a loop, **shift-clicking anything that wasn’t purple.**

And low and behold, one of these anomalous links warped me to some **random Discord server.** It was only **then, after all those unfocused cutaway references,** that I finally got the damn files to tastefully hem my character’s skirt just above the knee—**accompanied by warm woolen Ravenclaw-blue knee socks and a scarf.** Fuckin’ Nexus Mods, mate. What do we call them now? Nexus **fakin’ shit?** Still part of that server, by the way. Might just do my dooty and download some big thicc fictional wizard booty.

Corruption? Oh, it’s there—**thick and dripping.** A company not driven by fairness or even competence, but by some strange, **zealous adherence to ideology**—an ever-morphing agenda, loyal only to itself. It’s subtle at first, almost laughable, but then it hits you: this isn’t just a game of modding politics. **No, this is a slow, calculated erosion of the cultural fabric of the greatest, most wonderfully gay retardest nation on earth.**

You know the one. I don’t even have to say it. **It’s US. BABY. HAWK-CAW-CAW-CAW!**

It’s all right there—**right under your nose—one big false flag.** A TikTok-ass rizz fade-away while the gears grind down the system. **Cultural. Academic. Social. Gone.** You think it’s a conspiracy? **Maybe.** But hear this… grab a big handful of that **Albolene** and you better start **power-jabbin’ that fist**—maybe send some static to jump-start that moist pink thing you once called a brain.

**Goon. Edge. Hmm. Goon. Edge. Think. Goon. Edge. Read. Goon. Edge. Deez nutts.**  
**Goon. Edge. D. E. I. is C. C. P.**
