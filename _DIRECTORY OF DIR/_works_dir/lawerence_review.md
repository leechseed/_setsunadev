### Reformatted and Readable Version

2013. Loved _Homesick_. _So Damn Fast_ managed to break down old scar tissue in my soul and left me feeling beyond cathartic. Back then, so much soul was in the music. The melancholy, twisted-up feelings of the past—the kind that trip you up at the worst times in the present—were so **real** in _Damn Fast_. God, I can't believe it's been so long.

I'm happy for y’all. Glad you got a Christmas album out. Clyde, you and your sister deserve all the best and all the success. I just wish people could travel back 13 years ago to when _Homesick_ came out. No one was making music like y’all. In a sea of Ableton and digital bips and bops, Lawrence felt like a rogue wave from the past.

I loved the way the album was mixed. It had all the dynamics that captured every important part of jazz funk—a sound that so many "wub wubs" were phasing out by crushing and compressing everything until it was just a wall of sound. Not that there’s anything wrong with that style, but, man, hearing y’all come up on my discovery playlist back then felt like fresh air.

Now, I see you're playing in Jacksonville, and I’m tempted to go. But, man, it feels weird to say this: I think the sound went in a different direction than I did. I found myself sticking to my guns, keeping my ears frosty for the next thing to snatch my curiosity and demand my attention.

I feel like Lawrence's sound today is the culmination of years spent trying to make a difficult yet wonderful concept work. _Family Business_ feels like that concept finally having to compromise with a market that didn’t really want—or care for—the sound back in 2013. It seems like the trend Lawrence bucked off back then has come into the studio in 2024 and showed them the truth:

The only way to make it from here is to do two things:

1. Be more derivative (_Whatcha Want_).
2. Sound more familiar (_Guy I Used to Be_).

Rather than a stripped-back return to form, it feels like a maximalistic, "throw the kitchen sink at it" approach—shock and awe, sensory overload. It’s just muddy and loud.

One of my favorite live performances of Lawrence is their _Sofar Sounds_ set. If you haven’t listened to it, go check it out. For those who doubt me: if that doesn’t convince you their sound has changed—arguably not for the better—then I’ll stop yapping. Now _that’s_ a concert I would drive two hours to see.

But with their current album and the couple of live shows I’ve seen recently, it feels like it wouldn’t be worth it. I’m not really into touring Disney Broadway shows.
